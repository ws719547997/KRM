During the actual strategic part of the game, you navigate bitmapped characters throughout a polygon map. The maps range anywhere from really small to quite big - it can take up to 20 minutes to get from one side to another. The landscapes are varied with mountains and valleys. The textures that are slathered on the polygons look great, and the bitmapped characters and enemies fit in like a charm. The spells don't look quite as good as Final Fantasy 7, but they are still really cool. Vandal Hearts did receive a rating of Mature, and there is really only one reason for it. When you kill an enemy, even if you just poke it with your finger, an artery-busting spray of blood is released. Although it may be a little gratuitous, it sure does look neat. The game is turn-based and you navigate each character individually. Because of the vastly different maps and buildings that would block your view of the action, you can rotate the camera around 360 degrees, as well as switch from a blimp view to a side view (and everything in-between). The camera is really intuitive, not hindering the game at all. Before you decide to start moving your characters and spewing some blood, you might want to observe the landscape and plan out your attack. Because you can see the whole map from the beginning, having an actual plan can be extremely helpful. I can attest that blindly running around attempting to kill things doesn't work as well as you'd think. The music is an orchestral score that will definitely get you pumped up into killing the baddies. The sound is equally as good; squishy blood sounds and the clashes of metal upon metal are all superbly done. The sounds that accompany the spells also follow suit, and you won't be disappointed by leaving the sound turned up LOUD.

4463	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	O.K. . The single player game is easy. You can beat that in an hour. But you get hooked. I played each level probably 1000 times before i finally started playing multiplayer. I played it so much my mom made me stop for a while. But does that stop me?! No way!! I still play it all the time. The only bad part of the game is the way hard to understand  campaign editor. Im an expert at the game and im barely a rookie at campaign editor. Everything is easy smeesy lemon peezy until you try triggers. But lets not talk about that. Lets just say its one of those games that you just remember. Its also HAS to be one of the best games ever created.
You get to have all type's of gun's and so on.
The graphics are great! Shooting with a bow and arrow never looked so cool. The music isn't bad, yet it doesn't really match the level sometimes. Some bosses are ridiculously easy, even for that time.
Difficulty: Easy to Hard
They're where a couple of things I didn't like about this game.
In addition to the regular carnage of destroying buildings, there are a few Time Attack stages thrown in for your speed-running pleasure.  There are also a few hidden goals that you can acheive in order to turn your gold-medal completion into a DOUBLE gold-medal completion.  Ahh, the simple pleasure of trying to get a medal and high score in videogames...

And the built-in campaigns are clever, though and lots of fun to  play.
Of the three, I have spent more time on Asheron's Call and found it's monthly subscription worth it.  Every two months, new scenarios, items and quests are added to the game.  They have done fun scenarios such as adding a creature with "god" statistics and having an AC programmer control it and wreak havoc in the world. Creative stuff such as snow during the winter (real time) and "killer snowmen".  The 3-D view that one witnesses while playing the game is impressive.  You can stand on a cliff in the middle of nowhere and view the horizon.

Camera: Many games these days suffer camera issues that are downright unbearable, but Final Fantasy VII's camera is always placed in the right overhead area and for some levels at in a nice side scrolling style. You can customize how you want the camera to behave during battle sequences, and you can even control the camera while on the world map. The camera here is perfect with no complaints.
There are very few non-player character interactions. In fact, in most cases an encounter with another character usually means trouble--some encounters result in a sudden "game over". This game, consequently, is a very solitary experience, with very little dialogue and with most clues being found intuitively and through exploration. I enjoyed this aspect of the game very much. Some reviewers have felt that the sudden "game over" encounters were unnecessary and distracting. Perhaps, but if you save often (as you should anyway), you can easily return to the gameplay, and the game makes it fairly clear fairly quickly that you should avoid ALL beings. Once the first serious encounter is made, the player is fairly well clued in that nothing about these worlds is particularly friendly.

But don't think accomplishing this is so easy. Everything has a price to pay in this game and without a large team of villagers to boost the economy, your civilization will not last for long.

Replayability/Value: I picked this game up new for about $12 on eBay, so I certainly got my money's worth. I don't see much replay value in the campaign, though I can imagine replaying it again at least once.  The skirmish mode is decent, and there are enough maps to keep you playing for a while.

4395	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played. Sure, terran  marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are  frustrating. You have to right click(why not the usual left-click?) to  select units and you cant deselect them. Building times are extremely long-  and so are the units. Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow( on a  Pentium II 400, voodoo3, 96mb RAM). I have only got up to the third terran  mission then finally gave up. And whats up by only controlling 12 units at  a time? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on  screen. Starcraft's ingame graphics aren't that good, FMV qualty is terrible  and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and  few options. Westwood online gives the player more options and is also  faster. All in all, i say the command and conquer series is better - go  play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C&C game - SC isn't worth  your time or money.

The game is very violent, which won't be a problem for many gamers, but it's something you should be aware of.

Unfortunatly, from all of the people that I knew, people either hated the game (most of those people are on this side of the love/hate group) and a few people loved it (Extremly Hardcore RPG fans seem to love it.). I love the game but this is the Final Fantasy game that a whole lot of people just can't stand. It is a long game, especially if you get stuck, so a guide (internet or actual guide i don't care) will really help. It is the easiest game to literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you a level up but using the junction system is also an important role in the game because it can raise your stats as well. This is a game that you will have to play for yourself. before you agree with the haters, give it a spin, please.
"Super Mario 64" takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in "Super Mario World") and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls.

Unfortuantly, no one who has played MGS2 is gonna go play MGS1. And that's a shame, because MGS1 almost beats the 2nd one. Better gameplay? Yes, there's a lot more action, stealth is more important, and there's more gameplay than movie. The story's pretty normal until the end. It seems like a regular terroist movie turned into a game. However, there are some bad things compared to the 2nd one. Bad graphics, can't shoot in First person mode, and you don't have a tranquilizer. Oh well, this is Playstation 1. They improved on MGS2, but only a little.

Excellent new aliens. From the one-eyed chicken-legged Shocktroopers to the bullish lurching sewer creatures, all new alien strains add plenty of much needed variety. There's plenty of them too, offhand I'd say that there's at least eight or so new enemies.
A certain degree of frustration does come with the game, however. Some golden bananas are impossible to get you do absolutely everything right. You'll do lots of falling and retrying (especially in the factory level) to reach some. Another irk is that you must get two coins in order to advance to the final boss stages. You must beat the original Donkey Kong and Jetpak. The problem is, no matter what, I could not beat the original Donkey Kong, which prevented me from beating the game. I spent so many wasted hours trying to beat that stupid game. Last, this game requires an expansion pack. Nowadays, expansion packs are hard to come by and cost about $20, which is probably five times more than the actual game will cost you.

You play BR dectective Ray McCoy (Sorry fans, but you can't play Rick Deckard in this.  But he does show up in a picture you recieve.  Plus, on the training maze, it shows his top score).  You're first assignment for the day is an animal murder of a fancy pet shop (in the future, animals are very rare, so they made bad fake ones).  Once getting your hands on a picture of several replicants, the perps that Blade Runners chase, the real story begins.
edit: One warning however... You can only use Simcity 2000 (yes it's that old..heheh) cities to "tour".. I'm pretty sure it cannot use Simcity 3000, Simcity4, Rushhour and Deluxe versions. I believe there are conversion programs that can move the maps at least (though probably  not the buildings) back and forth. It does come with 30 or so cities "prebuilt", so this isn't required. Of course SC2000 is still available not only alone but in various collection editions with other SC versions.

6856	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is absolutely a worthwhile gaming experience. This game has it all killer gameplay,replay value,great controls,graphics,sound,awesome and crazy levels with high speed. In 2003 its hard to find a game this good these days with a few exceptions (Halo,Halo 2,Doom III) but besides a few titles the new games just don't impress me,so they have better graphics but where is the gameplay and such. Anyways back to the review Sonic The Hedgehog 2 can appeal to almost anyone young to old. Also checkout SONIC CD FOR SEGA CD it is by far the best Sonic game and Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is second in my opinion.
-The levels are decently designed and reasonably long, but like X4, there are hardly any extras to find (however, this IS the first game). Powerups are easy to find for the most part (the dash-boots upgrade IS DIRECTLY IN YOUR PATH). Still, there are more secrets to find here than in any other MM game up to that point.
The plot - so important for a game like this - is only marginal.  All the twists are told through graphic novel-style comic book panels.  While they look perfect and capture a wonderful mood, the story itself is cliched and the plot often jumps all over the place.  The voice acting is great, but lonely college kids pose as models in the panels, and look ridiculous.  Oh, well.
Certainly a long game, but length is not always a good thing. Look at Conker's BFD, it was short, and still owned this game wicked bad. 15 hours of this, and you'll wish Rare had stopped there.
4400	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning, and money management. This game is, I guess you could say, one to grow with, it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way. I'd also like  to add that it helps, especially a younger mind, to experience freedom with  their money allowing them to spend it as they choose. If he/she spends it  unwisely (go bankrupt) that person will know to become better managers of  their money the next time.
If you have patience to try and figure this one out then go for it, but in all honesty I would not recommend purchasing this item, not even at a fantastic deal.  Unless, of course, someone gives it to you for free.
The CONS: None.

Value: 7/10 - A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better. But in this genre, we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead.
The violence level in this game is  a major plus.  You can blast your enemies anywhere and they will do  anything from having their heads explode to grabbing their manhood and  moaning, all in an extremely realistic manner.  They even limp around if  shot in the leg, which was a really cool effect considering that that is  how it should be.  Then if you shoot them in the arms or legs with a big  weapon, they will no longer be attached to the enemies torso.  Unforunately, gibbing left something to be desired, but it is made up for  with the exit wounds!

The overall presentation is amazing.  There is an unusual amount of detail here for a sixteen bit game.  It is quite possibly one of the best looking games on the Super Nintendo.  But what stands out taller than anything, are the games musical tunes.  It is some of the best you'll hear out of any soundtrack.  Even by today's standards, Donkey Kong Country 2 has a soundtrack that stands the test of time.  It still sounds good.  There are some great tunes here.  To this day I still listen to the Donkey Kong Country 2 soundtrack.  In particular Stickerbrush Symphony may be the best track the Donkey Kong Country trilogy ever put out.

If there was anything to criticize about the original release it would be the same thing that everyone criticizes.  The translation is absolutely horrible.  The story is incredible, but the script for the original Playstation version may be one of the worst efforts done in localization history.  It's almost worth it to pick up the PSP version of the game for this one reason alone.  Some of the translation is so bad some parts of the story are utterly confusing.  The only other problem with Final Fantasy Tactics is that if you really want to get through the game, you'll spend the least amount of time taking in the story.  As I mentioned earlier, level grinding is a must to survive throughout the adventure.  The problem is you'll have to do it too much.  To the point where it stops the advancement of the story.  Sometimes for long intervals at a time.  And the story hardly retreads or reiterates events.
Now, I stopped playing ff5 half way through because it is much longer than other final fantasys. It also has a saving issue. Sometimes when opening the save menu you will see the pixels go crazy. You have to exit the save menu a couple times or just select save by pressing down once than x 3 times. This bug is kinda annoying at times but it can be fixed. It does have high points though that should not be overlooked.

I love this version of the game the best (even more than that ReMake) because it has 3 options for gameplay, original, beginner or arranged. Arranged is awesome as it "arranges" the locations of many items in the game. Much like the "2nd quest" on the first Zelda game.

The training levels are easy to get the hang of. I dislike the cone-of-vision, because even if you were just in a room, you suddenly forget where everything is in it - even the walls - and have to visit again to make sure you didn't miss anything. If you swing by a room, it draws it as a complete room, so it's difficult to tell from maps where you have been and where you have just passed by.

- The hallway tubes in the Down the Tubes level are terribly animated.  I'm referring to the tube hallways you walk through as you pass those big armed, punch-happy enemies- NOT the tube race portions of the level.  It's in the way the tubes constantly wobble up and down in a pitiful attempt to give the player a tacky underwater effect.  It doesn't work as a result of the limitations of the Genesis hardcore no less.  In the Super NES version, these tubes stay in place.  The sunken ships in the backgrounds instead realistically move up and down in the Super NES resembling what a ship does in the ocean.  That's what this version is *trying* to imitate with the wavy/wobbly tubes, but it doesn't look as believable.
Game begins in thrash horror-hellraiserish environment but I wouldn't call it a horror RPG. Sure, there are scary elements but there are also extremely humorous parts, although game is more serious than Arcanum,which is prank-based. Story has both phylosophical and absurd humour aspect, since in all games you have limited life points and here, you are immortal trying to fid out about himself.
  Don't let those comparisons prevent you from buying this game though. In an industry with so many good games to buy,comparison will really get into the way of buying an enjoyable game. Buy this before buying FFVIII and FFIX, because it's much easier to learn and it will be a nice introduction to how final fantasies on PS work.
Shinobi III goes back to the gameplay of 'Revenge' and gives us more of the same only with improved graphics (great stuff for a simple 16-bit Genesis) and different locations.

5349	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When it comes to the Playstation there are games that have improved when they were remade for the Playstation 2 and there are games that look and play far better in the Playstation 1 version and Tetris Plus is one of them.

On the other hand Tetris Plus had the more colorful classic mode, the puzzle mode with 100 different puzzles not to mention the option to create and try your own puzzles and the vs. mode to test your skills against another player and all had the exact feel and challenge of tetris as I remembered it.  If you want a tetris game for your Playstation this is by far still the better choice.

As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around!



7786	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	When Mortal Kombat 1 was released on the arcades nearly a decade ago, it immediately became a HUGE hit. It was so realistic, and the hand-to-hand combat style was so extreme. The game also centered around controversy due to the incredibly unique violent content. Fans anxiously awaited for the game's arrival on home video game consoles. When it was released to the Super Nintendo, fans wasted no time purchasing it. However, the happy fans were quickly disappointed when they discovered Mortal Kombat to be edited. Thanks to Acclaim and Nintendo, this game has NO blood & guts! The fatalities are edited and toned down. The blood has been changed to sweat. MK fans were ripped off and very angry about the censorship in the game. At least the Sega Genesis version of MK had a blood code. The Super Nintendo version plays a lot like the arcade hit. The graphics, sound, music, and animation play equivelant to the arcade. But without the bloody violence and original fatalities, it's just not the same. This is still an okay fighting game though, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Too bad it's so old. I could do without it. MK II and MK III are a heck of a lot better. Don't waste your money on this. Rent it if you can.
9262	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a game I was introduced to back in 1996, after it came out, at a friend's house. It is put together a lot like Secret of Mana, graphics and all. It has the same item ring design, and the characters are similar. The music, like Mana's, is one thing I remember the most about this game; I find it to be haunting, though I can't put it on equal footing with Secret of Mana. For one thing it is a single-player game. You can't play it with a friend, and the story is not quite as deep. It's actually predictable. You can assume from the beginning the boy is going to go home. All in all, though, it is still one of my all-time favorite games from this period in my life.
But you know what? The folks at Jupiter still figured out how to make the theme work. The Pokeball is your ball, and several Pokemon play roles of obstacles. You know the drill: Use the flippers to knock the ball around the table to score as much as you can by having your (Poke)ball knock into things or other Pokemon. The physics might not be totally accurate, but it's not easy to notice. In fact, I think the pinball feel is pretty unique, thanks to the Rumble feature the game borrows from&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/the-Nintendo-64-s-Rumble-Pak/dp/B00004S9AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">the Nintendo 64's Rumble Pak</a>. You can really feel the action going on, and surprisingly, I can't think of another pinball game that does this.
I hope they make another sequal in the future RAMPAGE 3 which takes place in iraq or something like that well that would be mean I guess if they do that...ALL IM SAYING IS THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER SEQUAL! It's bin to long.

And Finally The gameplay makes you feel  like A soldier of Fortune, not a Infinate strength grunt.  You play this  game alone, there is no help from a partner (in the Single player).  Also  you can have only a number of Guns in your back pack and a number of items.  Plus there are many different factors on the skill levels.  each level is  progressivly harder.  And then there is the Sound issue.  If you shoot  rockets at everyone won't they notice?  well not in most games. but in the  hardest two difficulties you will notice you have to try to be quiet (which  is hard but possible)  That is what makes this game,  the innovation in  Gameplay.  Look beyond the Blood and see innovation which have never been  done before....thanks.
  1) Infiltrate the base
But like the ratings I gave it, this is a 5-star game and should be fun throughout the ages. Besides, it stars the arguably best (and best female) video game character to date. Go for it!!
All in all starcraft is a fine release by blizzard. A classic game of its time that even today has thousands and thousands of players on them game at a time. Hope you go and buy it cause it's really cheap now and it's good!!!
This game will keep you entertained for hours. I'm glad I found the game cheap, but this game is WORTH the full price, unlike many other games currently being sold.
The story is very real with characters that respond like in real life.  For example, I was playing a quarter of the way through the game, where we (Cloud, other dude, a couple other of Cloud's friends) had to walk up many flights of stairs to the top of this monstrously tall building---Cloud's friend gets tired of going up the whole stairway, "how much longer do we have to go".  That was when Cloud had to face another chaotic enemy, this time on the exterior elevator--hey it's challenging, but at least you get a good view of the city from a 1,000 feet up!.....Another instance is where, in this large scientific industry, Cloud falls off a bridge (not a bridge, just an overpass to walk on), 500 feet up in the air, with his girlfriend shouting for help---a very great movie sequence that I recall vividly.
4. Fun-This game is a 99.8 fun game, in my opinion of course. I am stuck on the Deku tree of how to get past the spiders. See, challenging, and fun!

Good news.  The characters are varied and this together with the materia system allows for a wonderful amount of customization and different play styles.  The characters themselves, while definitely cliche, have decent back-stories and fairly strong characterization.  I've heard a lot of complaints about character angst in this game, but I think those complaints are exaggerations and what angst is there matches the story and characters well.  The plot itself is solid and has plenty of twists.  The combat system works.  I say it's complicated and unintuitive, but it functions well and allows experimentation with different tactics.  Most importantly, there isn't a single algorithm for success; there are a variety of viable strategies for combat.  Most sidequests are fun, and while you don't need the sidequest rewards to beat the game, those prizes are often quite powerful but not overpowered.  This is nice as said sidequests neither feel like fluff/padding nor only masquerading as optional.  The net result is that the game rewards exploration and experimentation.  An additional nice touch is that grinding is, on the whole, unnecessary.  The cut scenes are well done, always convey something relevant, and never overstay their welcome.
Toward the end, I did find it necessary to go to a walkthrough online. The puzzles became to some degree inhibitive rather than contributing to the game experience. Once solved (by cheating a little), the storyline and graphics were rewarding enough for me to forgive myself my indiscretion. The final puzzle, I must agree with other reviewers, is unnecessarily convoluted and the end is rather seriously truncated. In this way, I was a little disappointed.


2:  Complete expandability.  You can create not just your own maps and campaigns, but units and weapons, which completely turn the tide and tactics of war.  It becomes realistic in the way of real war where it becomes a technology race, you build one weapon and they build a counter for it and so forth.  I have my units modified to be actual military units like the F14, the British Aircraft Carrier Arc Royale, XM-29 Joint Fighers, B52s and so forth.
Mario Kart 64 is addicting with four players, and it can be addicting with one player too. The Time Trials may be a little disappointing, but the Mario GP had me coming back for more.

I'm one of those that was completely sold on the Dreamcast. I'd never been more excited about a console and never have since. This was the console that finally would give us arcade quality games in our homes. I remember when I first saw 'Ready to Rumble' up and running. I just couldn't believe how good it looked and how fun it was to play. After looking at jagged and pixelated PS1 games for so long, it was a sight for sore eyes, literally. That game alone sold me on the system.

Let me  tell you, this is a serious GAME! Six CD's of it! You have to do some  serious character generation and a lot of  preparation before you get  going.  As stated by other reviewers, your characters die at the drop of a  hat in the early parts - no wonder people resort to cheating when your  characters start off so weak and so poor. I ended up doing a few early  quests and importing my character (which imports with gained experience  intact!), loaded up with as many arrows as I could carry and started again  at Level 3.  That meant Imoen was Level 4 when we met, and we could start  kicking some butt.

Personally i think this game should have had a new game+ function (where you can go through the game again with stats, materia, items ect.  But maybe if Square gets a remake going they'll throw that function in. Only because i never get tired of this game & its one game that does deserve a remake.
4681	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Ok, I admit it. I didn't purchase this when it first came out. I looked at the screenshots, I read the reviews, but I didn't think the game was for me. I was into shooters...I couln't be bothered with these so called R-P-G's. Then the price dropped below 20...and my computer gaming was never the same. This is by far one of the best computer rpg's that i ever played. The character options were so vast...the companions were plentiful, and the weapons were totally awesome. I spent a good 60+ hours with this game, and even then, once I was finished...I started another character and played it again. No other game had that kind of power over me. If you still haven't played this game...get it now. There are even user-made upgrades that improve the graphics if you have the sequel. This is one game that should be in everyone's collection.

Those who just pass up the Dreamcast because of Sega's past image are missing out on a treat. Happy Halloween, gamers. Go buy this system while there are still ones on the shelf. Pick up Sonic and Soul Calibur while you're at it. Good gaming.
There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile.

1952	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The second instalment of the classic Resident Evil series remains the biggest and the best. With four missions it is a massive game and each scenario adds its fair bit of challenge. The ending to the B scenario is mind-blowing, absolutely brilliant. There is a superb plot and it is great the way that the two scenario's (i.e. Leon A & Claire B) run parallel to each other and fit in with the storyline. Some people say that this is a bit short but when you finally complete all four scenario's on easy and hard mode then you will truly appreciate the challenge that this game has to offer. There are extra games such as the HUNK and TOFU scenario that add even more depth and challenge to an already massive game. The police station gives a very atmospheric setting to the game and the new batch of monsters can also give you a hard time. This is a landmark game for the Playstation and the whole Resident Evil series is fantastic. Hopefully, this quality of gaming can continue onto the Playstation 2.
5) Unique Items: The game is packed full of unique items that can be pretty hard to get a hold of. From weapons to characters, there are all kinds of things to track down. If you look through a strategy guide, you will be amazed to see the reems of info on stuff you can go on side quests to get.

Worst Flaw: Well, it would be nice if Tawna hadn't suddenly disappeared.  I think she should've been crucial to the entrtie series, not just the 1st game.
All told, though, the gripes are far outweighed by the quality of the game. Yes, this game is a classic for a reason. If you have ever played an RPG and liked it, give FF-VII a try. I did, and now I'm a believer.

3480	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I like the direction Sega took memory cards. At the time I really thought it was the future of controllers and memory cards. I might've been half right I guess. I would give this item a five star if it weren't for one thing that I really don't blame Sega for. It uses a lithium battery and for some reason mine always seemed to die before I even noticed. It's too bad Sega had some good ideas that were just harder to execute at the time.
Now while this game has some flaws, its still a good game overall, its not as good as the second and third game, but its definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, its only $6 on the PlayStation Store so its not expensive or anything. Its definitely a classic.

The graphics, while I'd prefer them 3-D not 2-D, are still very good for a game that was made in the 1990s and I would never want them taken away for that reason
Some of the levels are really strange.  The mine cart levels are gone, and in their place are levels involving these platforms that you ride.  These are quite possibly the hardest stages in the game, especially this one you will encounter later on where you have to jump in the air in order to make the platforms move in the direction you desire.  You'll see what I mean here when you play the game.
- Everything is too programmed. You figure out right away that eventually you can hit your opponent twice on the ground before they get up and finishing moves don't mean your opponent will stay down like they should. I did a 3-way match and dropped about a million diamond cutters on them and they get up right away.

The only fault with the graphics are the on screen characters which are too cartoony. Apart from that though, the graphics are brilliant, the music is one of the best soundtracks ever and the gameplay and lifespan are both excellent. Defenitly worth the money. Buy it now.
You have to collect rings throughout the level to stay alive.  If you get hit while you have rings, you lose all your rings, but if you get hit without any rings, you die.  If you collect 100 rings, you get an extra life.  If you have at least 50 rings by the end of a level, you can jump into a giant ring that takes you to the Special Stage.

The great thing about the first Pac-Man World is that the developers were able to mix new style game play in with classic elements to create a game that new players and seasoned pros alike could enjoy. The multiple new mazes playable feel like a blast from the past, while the platforming levels that make up the bulk of the game explored what was then new ground in a consistantly entertaining way.  The game established moves for Pac-Man that would carry over into two enjoyable sequels and featured plenty of old favorites like pac-dots, fruit, and those pesky ghosts in new and exciting settings. It also established Pinky as female, before all ghosts were assumed to be guys. (Except for Sue, of course.)

I remember when this game came out. It was the ultimate edition of Civilization. Everything the first was but so much more. Everything was fine tuned and perfected. Great sound effects and music as well as some nice little extras. Plus lots of additions never before seen in the Civilization series. Where as Civilization III took away a lot that made the series a lot of fun, this added so much more then the first had and truly made for an enjoyable experience that is still as much fun to this day. Far superior to anything else to ever hold the Civilization name and easily is still the top of the top as far as Turn Based games go.
3071	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was by far my favorite RPG game! all the other final fantasies and others are good but this one just blew me away! the graphics may not be the best but the touching and unforgettable storyline makes up for that. the characters are soo cool and if someone tried to improve this game it would be

The rides are great and there are no bugs  that I have seen. The add on pack is great and there are hundreds of extra  rides etc at the web site. The best is an Alton Towers scenario which is so  similar to the real thing!  This is a hughely addictive game. I bet if you  start playing it you won't stop til you finish!  If you like any sim  management game then buy this one!

Also, there is no giant screen where you can save. You have to find the bonus platform, and make it all the way through the bonus part to save. Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus? Sorry!

Our only complaint has to do with item placement - if you raise and then lower a piece of land, it double-charges you for each phase of the change. There isn't really an undo feature, so if you make a mistake (which can be easy, sometimes) there is no simple way to just go back to your previous state. With blocks of land easily hid behind other blocks (despite their many view options), you often have to lower whole regions of land simply to "get to" the blocked one, wasting hundreds of dollars.
Don't let the 4 stars deter you at all. S&K is certainly one of the most memorable Sonic games of all, and if you liked Sonic 3, then I see no reason for you NOT to like this one. As a whole, Sonic 3 & Knuckles deserves its full 5 stars, so whether you want to find their original carts, or just play them on PC or the new Sonic Mega Collection, find them any way you can because these are some of the best 2D games that defined an age of gaming. GOTTA JUICE!

And now, the drawbacks:
8252	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	First of all, Here are the PROS and CONS
The gameplay is rediculously addictive. The materia gems were a good idea. Being able to fit elemental materia to weapons and armor allowed for great flexability. Combo certain materia together and your charachter could attack from two to eight times in one turn. The junction system in FF 8 is based on the materia system. Those who perfer 8 over 7 should compare and see that they are in fact fairly similar. Changing materia in mid-battle would have been nice in case of an attack that heals instead of hurting, takes one or more members of the attack team out of action.
The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game.
6823	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan stays true to the once popular cartoon series and comic books. Each of the turtles are playable and all of their major enemies have been included. Increasing your life meter can be done by grabbing the turtles' favorite food, pizza. Gameplay is better than average. Each turtle has their appropriate weapon. Every weapon has the same power so the longer weapons of Leonardo and Donatello are the most useful. One button is used for attack and the other for jumping. Jumping seems a bit tight, meaning you can't get too far on a jump. Jumps are best used to go straight up to avoid enemies or making a hop on to the next step up. One other attack is done by crouching and pressing the attack button. This will throw a shuriken. Levels are broken down into stages. When you lose a turtle on a level and have others left you will be brought back to the beginning of the stage you were last on. No continues are offered so you will have to make it through without losing all 4 turtles. Before each level or when a turtle goes down you have the option of selecting another. It is probably best to begin the game with either Raphael or Michaelangelo so you can have the guys with longer weapons for the more difficult levels.

The second game is a cinema quality  live action game with actors.  I was highly impressed at the acting skills  Sierra had managed to recruit and how involved the gameplay was.

Hope to see a sequel.


EIDOS: TAKE THE POWER BACK!
The chao garden in this game is easily the most far removed from the other 3 versions (in SA2, SA2B, and SADX). The others have cute, snuggly, happy chao whose lives are only miserable if your torture them. You know what you're doing with your chao and accidents are rare. Not the case in this game. Every chao is born as an adult, and will very quickly kill itself if you don't do something soon. Their movements, like most of the game, are very bouncy. I dare say this is the bounciest thing in any major-release game I've ever seen, actually. It's almost a high-speed environment with a visible difficulty level.

The characters look kind of silly (esp  Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejects)but i don't think the purpose  of playing a mario game (or any decent video game) is to see hunks and  babes.
First person shooter (fps) is the name given to 3D games in which you are looking thru the player eyes.  You see your weapon (and a big variety here) and the game world in front of you (and an amazing variety of levels here too).  UT takes a cue from multiplayer-type games and brings human-like intelligence into your computer.  The computer players act like real people so you don't even have to own a modem to enjoy the multiplayer experience.  However, many fans of UT swear by it's multiplayer element, which I must say, is the best in the business.  On or offline we're talking about a game that has claimed 2 of my mice (er, mouses...er, mices...oh bugger!).

The graphics and animation transfer well from the NES counterpart and we get to fight four bosses from the first game.  After you defeat them, you fight four from Mega Man 2 (this cycle continues and ends at Mega Man IV.).  The music was also good, some of them new including the Wily stages.  It's also interesting to see a change on the bosses; examples: Cut Man's nastier and Elec Man is tamer, Fire Man's weapon is good against Quick Man, and so forth.  And may I also state that the game is reasonably difficult... not "kick you in the [...] and make you love it" difficult like the first Mega Man for NES, but certainly not an easy venture.  Capcom also created an extra boss specifically for this game: Enker.  He's one of my FAVORITE robotmasters ever created.  His weapon may seem useless, but... well, you'll figure it out.  One last thing: YOU'LL LOVE THE ENDING.
Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  One thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing, at least for me.  I really felt that it was needlessly complicated and I never quite got the hang going through it quickly.  It's rather annoying having every party member have their own "equip" menu when you could just have one big "equip" option, and then just select a character from there.  I also hated having to physically put equipment in the person's hand before I could equip it.  It would've been better to just let me select a person, and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list.  Shuffling items from Nall's inventory to each individual character's inventories is a pain, especially if their inventory is full, and you have to move items out first.  Well, anyway, also of note is the leveling system.  Bosses are always the same level as Alex is, but regular enemies all have their own preset levels.  This means that you must strike a delicate balance between under-leveling and over-leveling.  I really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time.  Also, enemies appear onscreen--so there are no random battles, which is awesome.  Overall, the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable, especially for an older game.

7770	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	What can I say about A Link to the Past that hasn't already been said? You get to explore that world as you choose, opening up more areas to explore as you clear dungeons and find upgrades. Once you have beaten all dungeons in the first world, the Golden Land opens, a shadowy counter part to the normal world. Once you gain the ability to flip between the two worlds as you choose you gain access to even more secret locations and areas to explore. This game features more dungeons than any other Zelda game, and a large repertoire of weapons and gadgets give you plenty of options for combat and terrain traversal.

6606	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is definately a must buy for people who enjoyed Final Fantasy II and III on the SNES. Final Fantasy Anthology includes both Final Fantasy V (never before released in the USA) and Final Fantasy VI (III on the SNES) as well as a music cd that includes music selections from both of the games.
Roller coaster tycoon lacks flashy graphics, but the sounds are amazing.  The scream of the people on the roller coaster, the zoom of the go-karts, the ca-ching sound of making money, the boom of the thunder when it rains in your park.  The game has a simple yet specific money management, though it is frustrating to wait to collect money to fund your next project- a typical drawback of many simulations.  Another cool thing is the actually designing of a roller coaster, which is like an art, choosing the turns, drops, loops, etc.  The only drawback is that just the slightest drop, and the ride gets a rating of "Ultra-Extreme" and nobody will dare to ride it.  Each guest can be clicked on to examine what foods/drinks he's bought, or what rides, how much money, or even how happy he is.  The game is very addictive and definetly deems a reccomendation from me.  All simulation fans or Sim City fans will definetly love this game, and it is very easy to learn to play.  I even think this video game has an educational value, with the finance and money managing, and construction skills.  It is a game that will appeal to people ages 10-100.  Definetly get this game!
The characters I liked the best were Gon, Jin and Law. Gon is great because he's small and the taller character's kicking or punching always misses. Jin is strong overall, and my friend's nephew said that he's the best person in the game if you know how to control him. I can control him well, and demolished my opponent in 20 seconds (we were using the 50 second time limit in the 2 player mode). Law is a great kung-fu type of fighter and he kicks well. It's fun plotting the same kind of characters against each other - like Gon against Gon or Jin against Jin.
Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game)

The game play is astonishingly compelling, especially after the first 4-5 hours of play while you are orienting yourself with the many possibilities of the interface.
 The only place where D3 suffers is the in-game music. It's  boring, lifeless and worse, it sounds like the music we listened to in  computer games a decade ago. That is also not to say D2's Skinny Puppy or  Type O Negative was any better, I guess because it was an industrial  setting (a mine) they assumed that we'd want to hear industrial music.  Wrong! (And I like industrial). I found myself turning the music off and  reaching for a Star Wars soundtrack to plop in my CD player to accompany  the game. Beyond that I have little to complain about. This is a top notch  game as far as game play, visuals and sound effects are concerned. It's got  a break neck pace at times, while at others it's slow-paced which can get  really creepy until the first robot jumps you and you wet your undies in  shock.
In the game you get to talk to people that you seen before in the moives and other video games.
Where the game really fails is the gameplay. Shadows tries to include many different modes of play, and not all of them work. The snow speeder level is a classic, as it inspired the game Rogue Squadron; the speeder bike chase is rather cool, as is the fight with Boba Fett. However, in other areas of the game, your craft is stationary and all you are required to do is shoot. It's not much different from the Super Nintendo Star Wars games, and the simplistic gameplay can only entertain for so long. Then there is the first-person levels, which unfortunately make up the bulk of the game. Though the game has multiple view modes, Dash is easiest to control in the first-person mode, but the player won't even see the tip of Dash's gun, as is customary with all shooters. There is no target reticle, making aiming irratic. The levels are too big and empty, and are too straightforward. It's a simple matter to walk from point A to point B, with few surprises. You'll find yourself rushing through most of the game to get to the better levels, but unfortunately they're few and far in between.
5503	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This classic platform fighting game takes a little time to get used to on the Nintendo 64 controller, but none the less a good game for it's time period.
The only drawback  that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated,  otherwise you'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen. But  that aside, these babies are fun! My kids love them, I love mine, great fun  all around. Go for it!

My suggestion?  Wayt for a sequel or buy CIV 2!
I strongly recommend this game to anyone who plays video games. It's the perfect game for casual gamers, enthusiasts, or children (hopefully their parents are kind enough to introduce this gem to them before a Xbox 360). It'll provide you with hours of fun and is still one of the absolute best games for the SNES.


Gems: To get these, break all the boxes in the level. Sometimes you'll have to have earned a color gem to get a gem. 1 to 2 per normal level.
One thing I do like tho is this versions contains cheats you can input, and they are easy peazy to turn on and off. Code for invincibility, infinite combos, pretty much no AI and a couple of other things. That is one step up on the SNES version that I prefer, as it had 0 codes apart from random select.
All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).
This is not a game for everyone, I have met many people that found the setting and the story "too weird" or "too strange", although if found it very enjoyable, getting away from the average fantasy universe for a time.
COntrols are fluent enough and the menues are asy to scroll through.
The graphics of the second installment have taken a big step forward from the first game. Both the main characters and the creatures themselves move much more realistically this time around. Zombies will lunge when you get close, theyll stumble backwards when they take a couple bullets. Leon and Claire, as well, show the effects of the damage theyve taken. Both have three different methods of walking; an uninjured trot, a mildly harmed walk with an arm around their midsection, and a nasty limp, dragging their weapon behind them as they go. The more damage you take, the slower you move and the more likely you are to take additional hits. Every character, human and zombie, now comes fully equipped with an independently moving head, which locks onto the nearest moving object and follows it, staring, as it moves around the room.
328	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	For people who still have a GameCube, but don't have a wireless controller (don't bother, you'll be disappointed because none of them come with the damn adapter,) these cords are fantastic. I can take my controller all over the house with them if I please, and they don't cause lag or short out to any degree I can tell. They're not shoddily-made and have lasted well so far. I'd buy them again.
Characters (10/10): Wow.  Characters are excellently portrayed; they all have personalities and some kind of backstory.  Even Yuffie.  I mean, after playing a certain recent FF (12, cough), I've really come to appreciate the fact that no character in FF7 is just tacked on to the party (cough, FF12's Penelo, cough).  Every single character has a backstory that's relevant or ties into the main story in some way.
After the T-Virus outbreak at the Mansion, Claire Redfield and Leon Kennedy search what used to be Raccoon City for survivors and try to escape the city.

  Edge master is just like Inferno except he doesn't have any "only him" moves. He is the master of weapons but not as powerful as Inferno. He is a old man who has a very long beard. His hair is either red or white depending on his costume.
- You'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly. Because the drivers of other vehicles just aren't smart enough to do the job themselves.

The graphics  are the best I have every seen and there are like 100 moves for each charator. The great thing about this is that you can unlock charactors after you have beaten the game with other charators. THere is also mission mode where you go on "small mission" and then you can unlock stuff like stages and special features There is practice mode which I find very useful because I can practice my moves without getting disturbed or attacked by other players. My personal favorite is Maxi because I luv the Nunchaku and the moves look so good and his moves are easy and powerful. My least favorite charactor is Yoshimitsu because he is weak and doesn't have very powerful attacks. I have the prima official strategy book and that tells be all the secrets about this awesome game. Let me tell you a little about the story line. THere was once a night of Cervantes and he had the soul Blade. He was a great Knight and ruled for many years until Taki and Sophita destroyed the(all these charators you can play in the game). So One day, a young german knight named Siegfried came across Cervantes body. THe body burst into flames and Siegfried is now Nightmare. You are trying to get the soul edge and deafeat inferno.

5030	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	being the survivla horror fan I am, I have to start by saying that if you happen to see this at a discount store, or bargen bin, pick it up, and hold it close, as the game has become very rare in many areas of the world. This was Konami's answer to Capcom's Resident Evil, and still is one of the most popular horror games today. The game, unlike REsident Evil ,or many other horror games, chooses to scare you in a more mental, quiet sense (not to say resident evil is bad, I'm mearly saying SH and RE are very different form one another). The game is not for the faint of heart, or those with out a healthy ammount of patience, as the game focuses mainly on puzzle soving and exploration. although the graphics are dated by today's standards, this is easilly overlooked once you start playing. Although the game offers a fantasic story, and haunting atmosphere, I highly recomend Silent Hill 2 over the orrigional, as it has better controlls, smoother visuals, and an even better story. I have played many horror games, and believe me when I say that this one and it's sequels stand out amongst the rest, and shoud be added to any games collection. Silent hill is not a game to miss.
The side-stepping is almost ludicrously difficult. You have to tap the controller so lightly that taking a few simple steps to the side becomes impossible. I realize that, logistically, it would be difficult to find another way, but it does hamper your stride, particularly in the Tekken Force stage.

***Gameplay***

The visuals are the best in the series and push the SNES to its apex in graphics but unfortunately the soundtrack is the games biggest blunder. David Wise is only partially responsible for the games soundtrack as the task has been composed almost completely by Eveline Fischer. The difference in musical style is astounding for the avid listener. All the synth, guitar, and electronic instrumentation are replaced by slower piano like riffs and ambient noises. She does steal a few melodies from Wise however, it's clear her major influence is the series original. This would have been a welcome contribution for a sort of level or world but collectively dilutes the games potential to be memorable. The soundtrack was scrapped completely in the GBA remake 9 years later, which was composed in entirety by David Wise and in my opinion is much more pleasing to hear than this. Fischer's version was meant to be included simultaneously in the GBA port but couldn't be included due to time and spatial constraints.
-Bonus game


The audio here is just as outstanding as any other aspect in this game. I'd go as far to say that this is one of the best sounding games on Genesis. From the clear melodies, full bass tones, and near-perfect approximations of the music score, this is easily one of the most memorable soundtracks in all of gaming. Even the original songs stand out in the sense that they don't stand out. They feel right at home. You could have told me that these original tracks were taken straight from the film and then composed and converted to the Genesis FM Synth hardware, and I would have absolutely believed you. They actually hold their own in comparison to Disney songs. They truly are that great. The sound effects fare just as well. The voice samples are outstanding, and even put some voice samples I've heard on the SNES to shame (which, for the record, honestly isn't as surprising as you would initially think. Voice samples in Genesis games can sound absolutely superior to SNES games, if placed in the right hands).
8073	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The super mario world I know and love. A must have for anyone with a super nintendo. I strongly recommend!

As for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding.  The levels are big and challenging.  There's also secret levels in Crash.  I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you?  No, I didn't think so.  Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system.  In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area.  You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save.  If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all.  But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games.  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds.  You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms.  Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds.  Big flaw.  The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems.  In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending.  However, it's a little too hard to collect them all.  I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard.  To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life.  I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem.  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes.

1123	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didn't meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you don't already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now. Or else.
It's another addicting puzzler that is as much fun as the original.
With games like the 2 Zeldas and Perfect Dark, the N64 was a very capable machine at delivering solid play though techwise it wasn't the most advanced but if you can track it down or even still have it, it's worth giving the game another go.

The combat system is very unique and keeps you on your toes a lot more than your classic RPG. You also have a wide range of different powers at your disposal that give you a large choice of actions in each battle.
The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake.



The bottom line: this is a very fun game to play, but there is one thing you might want to hear: Zero is not for beginners. His moves are much harder to learn. However, masters should challenge themselves playing it with Zero. If you enjoyed the first three (X3 is the best), then I highly recommend this.

4. Easy to hold. This is a very comfortable system. I can play this for hours. I cannot do that with a Gameboy or a Gameboy Advance.

This is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time.  While I have loved most of the games, and enjoyed the rest, this one stands first in my heart for the Final Fantasy series.  This game has good graphics for the SNES era, and a long, involved story dealing with magical creatures called Espers and the greed of some humans to steal that magical power.  The story does not center directly on any one character, but a case could be made for Terra, Celes, Locke, and perhaps Edgar as the fourth lead.  The absence of a true lead character adds to the development of the story since it doesnt follow one character but follows a plotline where character move in and out of the story arc.  I found this game to be incredibly fun to play and was by far my favorite of the series.
Music: OMG! Ape Escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time. Not since Donkey Kong Country 2 have I entered levels just to pause and listen to the music. Ape Escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame. The music excites you and is very enjoyable. It has the best track of the entire series and its ashame Ape Escape 2 suffers from its bland soundtrack. In Ape Escape 3 the music is reminiscent of the first one, so I think the makers learned from their mistake. My favorite tracks are Crumbling Castle, Dark Ruins, Galaxy Monkey, The Spector theme, and a few others, but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime I hear one of them. It's underrated and I wish more people knew about it.
5002	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I love the story and this is what started the series, but I hate the game itself in terms of gameplay. The controls are a bit unresponsive, the combat is a joke and the prima strategy guide is an outright marketing scam. I just had to tell the truth of what I think about this. The gameplay is so bad for me that it just ruins the entire thing for me. I'd rather just watch someone play it with no commentary.

Are there any downsides? Sure, the graphics are a little blocky compared with current high def games. Still, the minute I launched into my Zerg world, I was oblivious to any minor issues with the older resolution. The underlying plot and gameplay were all there. The same is just *fun*.

"BUY ONE IF YOU LIKE"

There are dozens of reviews which talk about specifics, but here are my overall impressions circa 2010.

the endgame was a little far fetched.  the game was well thought out, but the ending wasn't commensurate with the game.  it was episodic.


Musically, this game is quite fantastic. If you have ever played the first Suikoden,


The story, according to the manual, is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake. When Mario reaches the castle, he is greeted with a gruff voice. Wondering what went on, Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in. There, he finds himself in a new world, with a giant Bob-Omb on the top. He fights and defeats it (you'll have to do that part yourself) and gets a star. Later, he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle, captured the Princess, stolen the Power Stars, and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings, then the world itself.

The Characters:
BUY THE GAME!!!!!
This game is structured like Zelda and plays like Zelda, except you can switch characters with the push of a C-button. I mean, you go around an overworld fighting enemies and getting ryo. Then you play castles (which are like dungeons) and fight a boss at the end, after which you get a keepsake. w00t! Ahem. It's like Zelda, but it's not Zelda. It's Goemon. And Goemon just doesn't have the polish Zelda has. Yeah. The graphics are decidedly like the run-of-the-mill platform games that appeared on the N64 in the last 3 years of the 20th century. But saying Mystical Ninja is not worthy because its graphics are bad is judging a book by its cover. To pass Mystical Ninja as bad game because of its graphics is unfair. We'd have to look at its gameplay.
Gameplay: It excels for one reason: The Job System. For the first time, you can customize your characters rather than just being one particular class. Master one job, move to another. The story is eh, music's ok, but play it cause it's a FF.

5766	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	FF8 is one of squresoft's best releases. This game is about a mercenary who joins an underground resistance group to defeat an evil sorceress. Eventually he falls in love with a member of resistance and is intent on getting her life back after it is taken by an evil sorceress in the future. When FF8 first came out I couldn't get over some of the qualities that just weren't typical FF style like the way they walked. In most FF games the characters are inside the lead character but not in this one. I eventually got over it and I'm glad I did because the game turned out to be awesome. I strongly reccomend this game to any FF fan because this game offers nice graphics, a deep storyline filled with: love, hate, betrayal, and pretty cool combat moves. The above review said that a con on this game is the fact that there are to many random battles, but that actually helps for quick leveling. The one downside to this game is that the last boss (Ultimecia) is very hard and so I reccomend getting as much work in the game done as possible before entering Lunatic Pandora.

2286	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	A 60FPS original Xbox game locked to 30FPS, with missing 480P support. As opposed to every other version, the US and JP PS2 port has support for switching the voice track between ENG or JPN. Choosing JPN helps massively with the cringeworthy ENG voices, but this hardly makes it a better game. It begins easy, then ends up slippery and borderline unfair in no time. You're essentially playing the same line of stages in the same order, with different missions per character. Also, the camera system has been completely screwed over by the porters. Honestly, this and Unleashed are great examples of 3D games in the series that are worse than '06. At least the framerate is stable...
9183	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	LJN was a subsidiary of Acclaim Entertainment created to make more games for the NES and it continued into the SNES/Genesis era. One of their first games they released for the SNES was WWF Super Wrestlemania in 1992. While it was great to see a game with the WWF license, it only turned out to be a forgettable wrestling game that sorely lacked content and variety.
It's a game that you actually, go figure, have to WORK at.  The easiest route is not always the most accessible and you'll spend a lot of time bashing poor Cloud, the main character, into walls trying to find the damn door.  On top of that, you have to battle beasts that aren't going to level up or down with you to present a challenge.  They are what they are and if you can't beat them you better be ready to run around the world a couple hundred times leveling yourself and your characters.  But, the upside to that is the convenience of crap to do!  There's a whole world of mini games and side quests that take up a majority of your time and energy.  The main story is captivating and you wish to see it to its conclusion, but at the same time Gold Saucer and Chocobo Breeding might very well make you into an addict.  This makes the game, in the later hours, a bit easy to beat since you might very well grab every summon and every materia known to the Planet, which will make your characters into walking, talking nuclear bombs without the fallout.

3980	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I thought this game looked like it would be great-- but it turned out that it was boring, irritating, not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new, and this game would crash every five minutes. A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon, and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it!  If you are interested in this game, I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead, it's a lot more fun, and it doesn't have bugs- don't waste your money on Sim ThemePark!
The  buttons are easy to reach, the analog control is well functioning and the  controller is nice to hold in your hands even when you have played for a  long time.
First off, Nintendo allowed Squaresoft, the masterminds behind the Final Fantasy franchise, to do this game. Normally, this would be considered a bad move, but to the credit of Squaresoft, they came up with a game that not only is extremely enjoyable, but still manages to capture the feel of a Mario game with all the zany Mario quirks. Bravo. On top of that, this game shows Mario in a more animated fashion than we have seen him in previous games. His actions and reactions when interacting with other characters (which was a first at this point) is amusing and symbolic of the family friendly and lovable Mario we grew up with.
First you have to be careful that you do not miss anything in this game. Draw from everything you encounter early in the game, because alot of early bosses have magic that you might not see for quite some time, and those spells are the key to sailing straight through this game. The more spells you have of one kind determine the junctioning stats rate of effectiveness. For example: if you have 30 fires junctioned to your str. and your str. is currently at 30, and you happen to draw 70 more the next battle, your str. will now be at 100 because you have more fire spells in your inventory and you are currently junctioned to fire. This was just an example because if I can remember right, the magic only increases the stats that they're junctioned to by percentages. The most of any spell you can aquire is 100, but experimenting with different spells on different stats are better than choosing auto junction, in which the computer does it for you without much diversity. 100 full-lifes on your HP works wonders though!

Weak story, repetitive gameplay, bad music, and graphics that make me wonder whether this is a Playstation game or a GameBoy Color game.  Stay away from this at all costs.  You'll see it selling for about $2.99 at some ebgames stores.  The price is that low for a reason.

The puzzles are also logical.  They make sence instead of being  wild things like ripping the leaves off a plant and combing them with a  rubber duckie or some other hair-brained idea.  I also loved the animation.  For polygon rendered people and buildings they were impressively  handled.
The only possible reason to buy this game is that the voice of Blasto is done by the great Phil Hartman.
- The male playable character (Leon) is also the star of Resident Evil 4

Other thoughts:

823	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When I first got my Gamecube, this game was part of the Zelda collector's edition. I didn't know much about Zelda, and had only played very few games before, but was mesmerized by this game. The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative; it really draws you in to the story. I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game.

Once I found this for a decent price of 5 bucks, I immediately clicked buy, and boy am I glad I did. Now I have never tried out 4-player co-op completely, but I have actually plugged in 4 controllers and it looks amazing. Now I know some people have said never to try this because of "Blurred graphics and limited view," but I don't care! All I care about in a game is gameplay, sound, controls, multiplayer, and music. The controls I had to get used to, but it wasn't horrible or impossible. The sound effects are awesome and the music is also better than the PC version. The game does have difficult puzzles but they are not impossible and the enemies are really awesome. I have played co-op and deathmatch with 2 players and I can say that  the game has amazing multiplayer. If you are a really big multiplayer fan and would like to play a game that has co-op and deathmatch and also is good by yourself, I recommend buying this game.

7829	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Diddy Kong Racing is the other major kart racer for the Nintendo 64. When it came out, most people were accusing Rare of copying the Mario Kart 64 formula. That may be true, but at least they made modification. For example, there is a major decrease in emphasis on items in Diddy Kong Racing. In Mario Kart 64, you need a good hold on the items to win. In Diddy Kong Racing, items are merely an afterthought. What are really important are the boosters strewn all around the levels. This creates a different racing feel that some people may like more than others. I personally feel that the karts are not as agile as they are in Mario Kart 64, and that decreases my enjoyment of the game. Ah well. The inclusion of two extra vehicle types adds a different feel to the gameplay. I didn't really like the plane, but hovercrafts rule! In a racing game, level design is just as important as the controls. The courses are nice, but a bit lacking in variety. Oh well. It was obviously a way to fit in with the five different sections in the single player mode. Gawd...the single player mode...the Silver Coin Challenges are no fair, I tell you!

Games:This is a high point for the DC,at the time it had some of the best games for all genres listing them all would take up way to much space. It is unfortunate that most of the Dreamcasts best games have been ported to either PS2,Xbox,or GC. But there is something about playing the original that makes the games seem so much better on Dreamcast. I'm going to list the pros and cons of the system:
======================================
The gameplay is based around stealth. You are Solid Snake, a spy working for a secret agency whose objective is to stop a device called Metal Gear, and save a couple of old guys. The story is deeper than that, of course, but in a nutshell, that's it. The controls, while laid out well, can be very unresponsive at times. The game itself is very fun (sneaking around to either get past or silently eliminate enemies), but is very easy to complete, and take away all of the cinematics and dialogue (12 hours of it all!), and you've got just three hours of gameplay.

The more men you have the better  dice so it eliminates the problem of have 2 guys to out 20.  As there are  tourdoments wicth in compairson to a command and conquer is like a compain.  Also in difference to the board game you can now chose your teritories  diffren.  First you can have the computer do it randomly.  Second you can  choose in a turn based way.  And third you can have an election which is  like an auction.  This game is well worth you money and is fun for  everyone.  Higly recommend.
Even better, if you have a high intelligence or good speech skills, you're rewarded with more dialogue options.

1760	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	THis is the amazing game that started the genre of "survival horror" and created the interest in fans for such games.  This game is pretty old now, but if you haven't played it yet you'll surely want to give it a try.  The point to this game is simple: survive a mansion full of zombies, while solving puzzles along the way.  What makes this game a challenge is the fact that you have to fend off enimies with a very limited amount of health and life. ANother challenge is that occasionally enimies will pop out and give you a surprise which you must quickly defend against.  ANother great thing is that on this version of the game you get a special edition of Resident Evil and a harder difficulty level.

I feel like this game is extremely overrated, getting so much positive feed back, but for what? My expectations were much higher after being so impressed by 7.  Maybe the bar was just set too high.  Maybe Square needed a break.  Then again, there are obviously people who love this style of gameplay, which gives them a much more different gaming experience.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst game ever, but it's just not the same Final Fantasy experience everyone loves.

I had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly  invincible.  I mean, come on.  Unless you are going to play this game  without accepting help from NPC's, this really proves no challenge and  damages the fun factor.  At least the price is right.

4749	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the greatest games ever made, period.  I LOVED the highly underrated Castlevania 64, and when I spotted Symphony in the store I knew I had to have it.  But it came in a discount case that hid the back of the game case, and when I took off the packagaing and saw the screenshots on the back, my heart sank.  It was 2D!  How could a 2D game possible stand up to a 3D game??
Graphics: Back in 1997, these graphics were jawdropping. That opening sequence with Aeris, the entrance to Gold Saucer, and awakening of ancient beings were just amazing. They seem tame now but back then, they were gorgeous. It isn't flawless though: the characters look "blocky" like it'll have a big block for a hand and in some cases, you can see them without a mouth but it doesn't detract from the feel of the game.
Bottom line, excellent graphics, excellent sound, online games, and hundreds of excellent titles to choose from for all ages.  Sega got everything right this time, it just happened too late for them to recover what was lost after a series of bad moves.  But that doesn't mean we can't benefit and enjoy the fruits of their labors.

FF7- basic weapon system
6158	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I really want to know who it is out there who seems to think that because you slap a recognizable name like Star Trek on a product and sell it is all one has to do. I also want to know how it is that two completely separate game companies, Interplay and Activision, can produce two separate games  (Starfleet Command and Star Trek: Armada) that work almost the same and  reek of the same shoddy workmanship. It is products like these that make me  realize why I have abandoned Star Trek fandom in the first place. Because  like Deep Space Nine and Voyager, they are so lacking in the creativity  that made the franchise so worthwhile in the first place.
This game is brilliant. It combines the RPG style of the Final Fantasy games with the adventure style of the Mario games so well. This is a great game, and it is definitely one of the best games I've ever played.
The problem with Starfleet Command is ambition. The game boasts true 3-D combat. This isn't true in the slightest. If you want 3-D space combat, go buy Homeworld. Starfleet command is on two axi, the X and Y. No mention whatsoever of the Z axis. Everything is played on a flat plane. Now, I'm no expert of space travel, but this just isn't accurate, nor does it make for an enjoyable experience.

Nostalgia can be a painful thing.

The good first: The game looks very nice. It has that same  techno-organic look as Battlezone 2, not surprising since the same guys did  it. It runs fairly nice, aside from the crashes. The framerate and overall  running is probably the smoothest I've ever seen on a 3D RTS, even  Homeworld. The interface is also quite well thought out, and a step forward  over other 3D RTS's, particularly the ease of camera movement.

8417	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	This game is horrible.  At the release of the movie I thought it would be fun to play the game series, then go see the flick.  I heard friends rave about this game, so I purchased it and couldn't get myself through the first ten minutes.  The camera angle is annoying, the controls clumsy, the gameplay corny.  The graphics left this veteran gamer with a sour taste.  However, if you like zombies and don't mind its serious flaws, give this one a try.  Maybe you'll feel better about it than I did.
Final Fantasy VI, as you have read in countless reviews, is probably the most engaging and emotionally involved game in the series. The characters all have likeable personalities, and their individual stories are very enrossing. As the game progresses, the player becomes more involved in their lives. The story is the game's strongest point, while the music is a milestone for any video game. Anybody who dismisses it as "just a game" should take
636	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is fantastic, and you won't be able to put it down for a long long time.  I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do.

Each character has his/her own ending.
I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.
Produced by 3D Realms, *Max Payne* is a third-person shoot through a noir-choked New York City. Finnish developer Remedy follows the standard set by Valve to immerse the game in an actual plot, bloody and surreal. We begin with our hero at the end of a vengeful rampage, and his reflections are the game. One fine American day, Detective Payne comes home in time to hear drug-crazed loonies shoot his wife and child. He hunts each intruder down, but too late. Payne joins his buddy Alex in the DEA. The killers had flown high on Valkyr, a new designer drug, and after three hard years the pair finally discovers the prime dealersa debased and savage crime syndicate. But the break bursts bigger than anyone could imagine: hitmen ambush Max and Alex during a subway meeting. Max survives, but somebody out there is determined, powerful, and sadistic: Max is quickly framed for killing his own friend. As a terrible blizzard sets over New York, cold rage sets on Max. His enemies think he is trapped and helplessthey only free his trigger finger

Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures has you help Pac-Man on his journey. That's right. YOU'RE a part of his ventures. Anyway, the game is composed of various objectives Pac-Man has to accomplish.

The trick here is that the player has to be pretty observant and aware of what's going on around the scenery.

9089	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Pac-Man is a really awesome arcade game. It's so addicting! You just eat dots while roaming around in a maze while avoiding ghosts. And then you could use a special dot in which the ghosts become edible. This, my friends, was timeless action the Namco loves going back to over and over again. Not in 1994, though, in which they release Pac-Man 2. Look at that cover art...I don't think this is maze game. I have a theory as to why this "interactive cartoon" has the Pac-Man 2 name. There was a Pac-Man cartoon show in the 80s. I can only assume this is a sequel to that. Since a new Pac-Man show is being made and set for next year, why not review Namco's attempt at doing something like that in a video game?
In the end Killer Instinct is a nice game to purchase, it will take a lot of practice to beat the final boss but it is so worth it if you win.
This game offers great challenge, great gameplay, flawless presentation, tight controls, and a great storyline. The music is so good I wish there were a soundtrack.
3188	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	It received rave reviews as essentially flawless at the time and the graphics definitely hold their own over a decade later. How many games can you say that about without being unrealistically optimistic? Soul Calibur for Dreamcast has highly fluid game play, taking the very best elements of other fighting games of the time and turning them into something beautiful. If you have a Dreamcast, this title is essential. With unlockable characters and story mode, replay value is extremely high. If you have a "gotta catch 'em all" mentality, the story mode will keep you busy for a very long time. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.
While I refrain from calling Castlevania: Symphony of the Night the Playstation's best game in the face of games like Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid & Xenogears, I must admit that if I was forced to choose but one, it may very well be it. I will say that it is an amazing title in all aspects, and sadly, as things seem to be unfolding, perhaps the last 2D Castlevania title. The latest two Castlevania games, both on N64, have been in 3D, and to be honest, quite lackluster. As fate would have it, the only other known Castlevania title in development is also in 3D, this time for Dreamcast, and while I can only hope it can recapture in some small way the splendor that is SOTN, one has to suspect that the inherent problems with the titles is that they are not 2D, which is the soul of the series. If you want a post 16-bit title that is truly Castlevania, there is only one route to take, and that is Symphony of the Night (or the Saturn import version known as Nocturne in the Moonlight, which actually has a couple of extra areas and a playable Maria).
Though there are adult themes and bloody scenerios but that's why this game is rated Mature.  But the way this game is set up, it is still a classic and a blast to play and replay.

Originally released in 1997-98, when it was deemed the "RTS game of the year", Starcraft is perhaps one of the only RTS games that you can still find on shelves at stores, close to a decade later! Although new RTS games have invaded the market, bringing with them cutting-edge 3D graphics and unheard-of computer requirements, Starcraft still, to this day, stands alone as the finest specimen of RTS ever created.
I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it.  The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen.  But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good. It's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used, and only a couple dollars to buy brand new.  It's not even worth THAT much!

I've played other computer RPGs (going back to Pool  of Radiance), but none really could bring back any of the real excitement  of AD&D.  Happily, "Planescape: Torment"  does.
8176	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	As the original pack-in game for the Super Nintendo, this is a worthy successor to the Super Mario series! It expands the Super Mario universe without sacrificing the fun or addicting gameplay. In addition to improved graphics, Mario has new moves including the ability to throw turtles, fly, and ride around on a little green dinosaur named Yoshi (his first appearance in the video game!). The world itself is huge compared to previous Mario games, with a nice variety of settings including Haunted Houses. A battery backup lets you save up to four games. This game should be standard issue for all Super Nintendo owners.

But like I said before, Perfect Dark 64 is the new Bond.  The main story is fun and so is the multiplayer combat.  There's a crap load of Bond characters to unlock and levels too.

Metal Gear Solid 2: The game play in this game is completely revamped to make the game look more realistic along with its graphics being greatly upgraded to also make the game more realistic however the characters are often disliked (especially Raiden) and the story is mostly conspiracy and gibberish most people either love or hate this game. Not all the info needed to draw accurate conclusions of what happens in the game are provided within the game some appear later in the franchise,so the entire game is left open to speculation on what actually happens.  The story was orignally intended to end the franchise with eye opening thought provoking ending but it tries to convey too much all at once. So your left trying to make sense of real life themes, games plot points and other references all thrown together into a melding pot which make up the ending of this game.  Even if you think the game is gibberish the VR Missions are an improvement over the first games and are a fun distraction.

1167	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	In its tenure, the N64 had its share of bad games. With exceptions like Super Mario 64, the THQ wrestling games and a few others, it seemed like the bad outweighed the good. But with 'Ocarina of Time', the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game.
As for the multiplayer, I couldn't find any places to try it out.  Perhaps that should be a warning that the MP is lacking.  That's a shame.  I've dreamed of a double play style game such as this.  First person shooter/flight simulator.  Drakan fits the single player bill.  Perhaps Drakan II will fix the MP and give us what we want!  Are you listening Psygnosis?!
Single player mode is pretty fun. The missions aren't really all that bad. The story is decent and I enjoyed playing it all the way through. The gem to this game is the multiplayer options.

Here the plot:Chaos 0 is released from the Master Emerald by Eggman and he feeds on the Chaos Emeralds. Chaos 0 is upset by an earlier experience but telling it would be a spolier. Six characters has a different storyline but in the end they all intersect into one huge battle. *SPOLIER* Chaos 0 turns into Chaos 7 and turns the town into his own personal waterpark.

1139	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	GAME TYPE: Role Playing
The first thing you'll notice upon beginning Alucard's quest, is that this is not your usual Castlevania title. More closely resembling Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (NES), or to be quite honest, Super Metroid (SNES), SOTN sprinkles the tried and true play mechanics with a good many RPG elements. The ability to equip multiple items (weapons, armor, items, etc.), level up to gain strength and the ability to purchase potions, maps and other items, even conversing with the occasional NPC (namely Maria), are all typical to RPG's and their addition to the Castlevania formula results in a game that's very much more than the sum of its parts. Dracula's castle and the catacombs underneath are a huge area to navigate, requiring some time in the early going (you'll soon open warp portals to speed your quest later), and as such, the map is invaluable as far as finding areas you have yet to explore (again, they took it straight out of Super Metroid). The thing is that to unlock certain areas, you'll need to acquire items or abilities. Indeed, the true challenge in SOTN is not only defeating Dracula, but being able to explore the entire castle, both normal and inverted. And lest you think all this will be a tedious chore, let me assure you that controlling Alucard is a small pleasure in itself. While his movement is very fluid, he controls wonderfully, and while it will be second nature to any Castlevania fan within movements, the additions of certain spells to Alucard's repertoire make mastery a bit more involving. And for those who would rather control a belmont, Richter is selectable later on by code, although the going is considerably tougher for him. Konami could not have delivered a more complete experience.

Ok in my opinion the best way to un-cover this story is to play the first half of Crisis Core (until you reach Nibelheim) then start playing FFVII (this game) until after you get past the part where you find out about Zack.  Then go back to Crisis Core, beat that then finish FFVII.  It doesn't really matter what game you play first & vise versa but if you play this game all the way through it pretty much spoils the ending for Crisis Core.  Although i still think it was exciting to see the ending in higher graphic quality i just knew what was going to happen.

Everything here can be used to your advantage, from street polls to swing on to boxes & cafe chairs to throw. The different environments really give you something to look at and each player has their own unique power moves. Unlike other games, this game makes you look for Power Stones, which transform you into a person with enhanced powers. Then they can really do some damage. Just getting to the stones first will be hard enough, along with defeating your foe. It's a cool game and I highly reccomend it.

I hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream "Thanks for nothing, bonehead!"

5354	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Because of the new Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks game coming out, I decided to get all my old MK games out to play. Among them was Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and this lil gem. Despite what everyone has had to say about the game, Special Forces isn't that bad a game. I mean, if you're any MK fan at all, you're going to get this one just to keep up with the Mortal Kombat mythos. I especially enjoyed the game because it explained alot of the backstory as to how Jax and Sonya first got into MK. I'll admit, however, why they chose Jax to have a starring role in an MK game of his own is beyond me. Not that Jax is a bad character and fighter in the game, he's one of my favorites. It's just there are other more beloved characters from the universe that they could have used. When you think about it, that could be the reason why people didn't make this a big seller, at the time. At any rate, I loved the game. For the first time, it was a Mortal Kombat game that took place in an actual 3-D environment. Fighting is intense with the basic, special, and combination moves.
This is a really good game for all gamers and it hits the essence that is 3-D fighting games. Plus new characters and new fighting styles are also pretty cool. The drawback is that the old "button mashing" is still a viable means of winning the fights and for a lot of the characters, some of thier combos that's all you have to do (best example: Eddy Gordo). For those of you advanced gamers, try the new and improved King, Jin and Law.

5108	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This game is fun to play, but the graphics are terrible.  The terrain is green, with some very sparsely placed trees and signs.  It is fun to beat down other racers with pipe, chain, hammer, etc... but the bikes are nearly impossible to control at full speed.  The expansion pack for the N64 is the biggest waste of money i've ever spent.  It does NOTHING to help the graphics or sound quality.  multi-player saves it from the graveyard.
2095	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Okay I'm not totally lowbrow, I can get puzzles (I got near the end of this game called Lighthouse). I couldn't get this at all when I played it, not even a bit. You roam around this island getting fragmented information, and at least on the computer the puzzle hit-detection seemed weak, so trying to access the puzzles themselves even with a guide was a frustrating endeavor. The puzzles themselves were bad enough, but the fact that solving some of them didn't seem to change anything discernible (at least in the early stages of the game) meant I ultimately gave up in frustration.  Not to mention it wasn't even fun.
-THE ZONES ARE VARIED FROM PREVIOUS GAMES. Yes, there is another volcano zone, but now you can explore new areas like the massive tombs of Sandopolis, the flying ruins of Sky Sanctuary, and the inner sanctums of the giant Death Egg ship. Plus now you get to take out the giant Flying Battery ship which attacked you near the beginning of Sonic 3. Strangely, this seems to be the only Sonic game without a water zone, which renders the Bubble shield useless, but oh well. In contrast, you will find more use out of the fire shield though.
PROS:

5 stars!



Graphically, it's stunningly beautiful, as are the sounds and music. And you will laugh out loud at some of the cut-scene dialogues and you'll be wondering if the creators were part drunk when the put this all together. But it works very much in its favor. It's one of the top 10 games I've ever played, but it's definitely the most unique.

8324	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	If you're looking for a great adventure game, there's no need to look further then "Titanic: Adventure out of Time." All the elements that make a wonderful adventure game are here; an intriguing story, great environment, interesting characters to interact with, and it can even make your heart pound. I have played it a numberless amount of times. This is a game that is timeless.
Needless to say, I haven't completed this game, and I don't plan on it anytime soon. This game is just bad! If you want to wander aimlessly around a series of cartoony cities, each with hidden dungeons and shops and no sense of purpose whatsoever, then by all means get this game. I for one would rather spend my money on a nice root canal, or perhaps a spinal tap.

7824	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This game plays ok, but Nintendo caved to media pressure and edited most of the best content out of the game.  This game feels neutered.  It is like buying a music album you really like from a great artist only to find out you bought the radio edit version instead of the explicit version.  Granted a lot of games that were ported from an arcade console to the SNES system had to be altered to fit the parameters of the system, but this game could have left in the gore and everything else.  This is one of those rare times where Sega got it right and Nintendo goofed it up.  One of my favorite parts of the game was playing against other people and ripping off their heads at the end of a battle.  None of that in this version.  I feel like it should have a Care Bears sticker on it or something to let  buyers know this is the G rated version.
5568	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I always wanted to have this game to complete my Mortal Kombat collection. I even had to get a Dreamcast in order to have this game. No repentance at all. This game is awesome.

I had one game going for over an hour on level 9 and I am not even sure what rocket I ended up with but it was a pretty decent high score.  I wish I would have written it down.  I could have kept playing but my eyes and thumbs were getting tired.  That is not an everyday thing just happened to be hitting a ton of Tetris's in a row on that high speed setting.
First and foremost, it isn't quite what you'd expect for a movie licensed title on the Genesis. It's far more than your typical platformer or beat 'em up. Toy Story employs many different styles of gameplay, and they all work well. From platforming, first person exploration, driving stages (both top down and third person), to inventive level design and boss fights, Toy Story is the most varied 16-bit gaming experience you can find right next to both fantastic Earthworm Jim games.
Note you can play in the HoloDeck by yourself as well, to practice.

2956	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the best Final Fantasy games there is it re-wrote the video gaming at the time and introduced a new system of magic and weapons to the FF series. It is a lot of fun to play and I would buy it again if my copy ever got damaged.
Then there's "Whomp's Fortress" (which was remade into a retro stage for "Super Mario Galaxy 2"), always fun, "Jolly Roger Bay" (a nautically themed, very creepy level with a scary eel and an enormous pirate ship; it was always my least favorite), a haunted mansion "Big Boo's Haunt", and a level of either epic or bite size preportions, "Tiny-Huge Isaldn".  Each level brings new and fun ways to interact with the environment hithertoo unseen previously in other levels.
graphics 10/10
- difficult game
The music however was slightly altered.  Some I don't mind (most of the stuff form Ninja Gaiden 2) but Act 2 in Ninja Gaiden 1 was a big dissapointment.
Graphics-4/5, almost like black-and-white super mario world.
In addition, many new games coming out are so graphic-intensive that they require the expansion pack to even play. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a key example. This is an EXCELLENT game with great extended gameplay, but you can't even start if you don't have this pack in place.

Over all it's pretty fun but it's alittle inapropraite for little ones...
I've been playing this game  since I finally got mine in January or February, and I really can't see  myself giving it up any time soon. :o)
Sound-5/5 classic Mario Tunes, and great final fantasy-ish music also. kudos to the big N and Square Soft.

2970	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	There is very little about this game that can't be enjoyed.  Because of that simple statement and resident fact, the game has become an absolute joy and cultural icon in the gaming world.  If you've gamed, you've heard about FFVII, if you've played Final Fantasies before, you've most likely been inundated with information about this FF.  Ten to one, you've probably played it.  Over and over and over again.  And for good reason.

You can find some really fun cheats online for this game, which also makes it really fun.

Excellent 3D levels such as -
Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.

Are there any downsides? I imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters, who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot, probably won't be as keen on the strategy based, long term planning involved here. That is quite fine. There are different types of games for different players. For strategy fans, Age of Empires II is quite a treat.

I'll just say this one thing:  If you're deaf or impatient, AVOID.  There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck, even if you're  NOT deaf, it's still quite a puzzler!

8680	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I first played this game in about 1994, a couple years after it first came out, at a friend's house. At this time Mario Kart was one of the most popular games for the SNES. My friends and I would have tournaments, though usually on battle mode. We liked Yoshi and Peach because their turning ability was better than the others, but we used Toad and Koopa Troopa during races because of their superior control at drifting.
The enemy designs are pretty cool considering this is a Game Boy game.  There's snakes that come out of the ground, there's plenty of other creatures that remind me of rippers from the original Metroid, hermit crab-like creatures that wander back and forth, and there's even a laser-spitting robot in a few sections!  Those are just some small examples.  Many of the enemies from the original return as well.  The bats are probably weak though.  Just look how TINY they are!
The story line is top notch.  Mixing in philosophy with life, death, and belief was just plain genious.  Once you get into this game you will not want to leave.  AS you go along your journey you will unravel more of your character's past lives and what kind of people he once was.

It has two-player ability which tends to make it easier (subject to your comrade's abilities, of course.).  There's only four levels, but it's four levels of sheer oldschool ultimateness.  The graphics are ok, if not that great, but hey... we all know gameplay is what makes the game, right?

In addition, the AI of UT and Quake III  are what really make the First player mode a treat in UT and a painful  experince Quake III.  First of all, the first player mode in Quake isn't  worth my fingernail clipings.  It is terribly lame and also the bots AI's  are very sketchy and need a lot of teaking.  In UT, first player is great  for both newcomers for practice, and for pros who want to practice offline  before they slug it out online.  These guys act almost if not exaclty like  human players!

Fun factor- 1,000,000/10...yep you read that right. There are plenty of power-ups to collect, among many other things such as missle containers and energy tanks. I've beaten this game probably 15-20 times, and it NEVER gets old. In fact, my SNES malfunctioned recently , deleating my Super Metroid file i had recently started. I was near the end of the game when it got deleted, but I still found myself playing it again without being bored or sick of it. In fact, I'm glad it got deleted, because now I can play through it again!!

The settings are all classic action movie settings, like the run-down hotel, New York streets, and boat dock, slick office buildings, and even a chase through a parking garage.  The fire-fights are amazing, with or without bullet time, and the weapons are all unique and fun to use.
8410	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this game earlier this year,I use to rent this game back when this system was popular. This game is different from a lot of fighters like Mortal Kombat,it has strategy that involves timing moves at the right time. For example,Ken/Ryu have slow,medium,and fast fireball when pressed with light,medium,and heavy punch buttons. The problem with game is that you must have a six button controller or you will have to press start to change the kicks from the punches,plus its way more fun with the six button controller. The graphics are  pretty close to the arcade counterpart,and still look really great compared to some of the other Genesis games. I own Street Fighter Alpha 3 on Dreamcast,so I have experience about Street Fighters games. I still think even after all these years SF2 is one of the greatest fighters to come out,or maybe it's just me thinking about childhood memories of playing this game early in the morning before anyone got up.

Sadly, you get spinouts at EVERY turn. Which makes racing more about luck, rather than your talent. When going at 50 mph, a little tap on the DIGITAL controlls will make the car swirv all around the track, and then ending in a spin out. I truely believe that beating a race on the game will be even harder than beating the same race with the same car in real life!
In the club level, you check all the doors and the windows to find the missing kids. Your enemies are bad guys in blue suits and waitresses. In the streets level, you have to check the cars (watch out, some have bombs). Your enemies are a bunch of punks and... dogs. Yes, dogs that sound like cats meowing. I found it funny. The 3rd level is a graveyard even though the game calls it the woods. It's clearly a graveyard with tombstones, haunted scenery, and zombies. Unfortunately, there is no THRILLER music, even if you do the dance move. So, there are zombies and birds for your enemies. The 4th level is a cavern. This place is really confusing, but simple to beat. You spend a lot of time wandering around until you find out you are supposed to spin on the walls with the spider symbol and press up+B on the circle symbols to find everyone. Your enemies are spiders, zombies, and guys with guns. The next level is the enemy base (I don't get it), but you are in a large base from like Terminator or Robocop or something with a bunch of computers and turret guns. Find the kids to win. The enemies are guys with guns. Here, you get to see MECHA-MICHAEL-JACKSON. He is a super cyborg robot that flies and shoots lasers. It is freaking awesome and puts transformers to shame! After this, Michael Jackson turns into a car and flies into space. This is the flight simulator part and is very difficult to figure out. Shoot down Mr. Big and see CONGRATULATIONS! which is spelled right.
Luigi-Go to pratice and beat everyone's (except the bonus character's) bonus game 1. Luigi is faster and stronger than Mario.

MediEvil is a hack and slash game involving the undead, but unlike popular games that involves zombies in some way like Resident Evil this one is less....realistic. The game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that, I usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics. The story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named Zarok. Zarok, who overhears this, decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in Fortesques (the story teller) story he sends him out to battle but Daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything. 100 years later Zarok returns but so does Fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal one.
There's something special about being able to choose your daily driver car and take it for a spin around Seatle's street course and recognize its handling. The only complaint I have is the lack of any Italian sports cars (Ferrari, Lambourghini, etc.) They do include Porsche, but only as a tuned Ruf version (which is nothing to complain about).
graphics. they were horrible. yes even for that time. save for the stunning FMV sequences and the cool summon scenes (that got old way too quick) there was nothing pretty about this game. dull grey and bland environments abound. characters that made Lego characters look realistic, and just an overall boring and grimmy disgusting lifelesslook to the whole project.
It gives ya a fright and takes u to the Zombie Kick Ass Game NOt the number 1 resident evil game (2s better) But it sure worth it to give you a fright
Yoshi was just starting out in the original Super Mario World and Nintendo weren't entirely sure what kind of things they wanted to do with him.  Look how much Yoshi has improved in this game!  You can jump on enemies, stomp on enemies, spit enemies at other enemies, turn enemies into eggs, and shoot eggs with a sliding target thing (it's hard to explain but it will make perfect sense once you see it).  You can also aim your tongue upward, reaching for things above you (including baby Mario when he floats away).  You control Yoshi throughout the game which explains all the new things he can do.
3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each

There are very few games that I fall in love with and have to play over and over. Mass Effect, Heavy Rain, and Fable to name a few. The story is great, the characters are very memorable, and it has one of the best villains out of most of the games I've played. At certain points in the game you actually feel there is no way you can win against a guy like Sephiroth and why bother.
Best game I've played!  If you like action adventure, this is the best game for it.  It is sooooo cool, the movies are pretty cool also, weapon, a monster, IT LOOKS AWSOME!!!!!!!  This game is totally the best, best graphics, it is just too cool.  No blood so parents, no fear for children, just violence.  I recomend this game to EVERYONE!

Secondly, the music of this game is some of the coolest ever produced for a video game. From the neat intro to the music played after you defeat a boss or a level, the music in Nights is pure magic (except perhaps for the terrible end game music).

7993	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game can try your patience. If you are good at playing older Mario games, then you will have more than half a chance to beat this game.  I found it very hard to say the least. In some levels especially toward the end, I would try a level for a couple of hours and when I would advance, I would quit, and try some weeks later when I mentally wasn't spent. I could not forget about it; every time I beat a level I would think "maybe I could do the next one." I could not beat the boss at the end and had to be satisfied with that. Almost at the end of the game, I found a cheat, it is the first time I have used cheating and it helped me mentally to keep trying, and to see the ending.  I wouldn't use this until you really, really need it, because it would ruin the satisfaction level for you. To see ALL Cinemas and Levels * with the game off hold L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 *on controller 2 * (you must be in the second controller slot) Keep holding those buttons and access the options screen, then the tree house, then load game. You can save and keep your progress after using this.

I would go to my best friend's house, who was a huge Sonic kid and get my fix. I just bought a custom painted and refurbished Sega genesis for my girlfriend, cause growing up, she was a Sonic kid. A nostalgic gift. I love playing this game!
However, That's literally the only complaint I can muster about the game. It's a wonderful game that I would highly recommend to any of my friends and any one who asked me.

Multiplayer includes the  standard deathmatch in addition to a couple of excellent alternatives.  There is a realistic deathmatch where one-shot kills are prolific and  fatigue play a factor.  There is also arsenal and assasin.

Lunar Silver Star Story Complete is a fantastic RPG that despite being released on the Playstation, was still fairly overlooked.  It does, however, retain a strong audience.  A fine game where the effort of the creators really shows through fantastic writing, a well crafted story and some of the most well developed characters to grace the genre.

3569	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	My two favorite game systems both had short lives and a great software library (partially due to the fantastic imports available from Japan and elsewhere). They were also both made by Sega. The Sega Saturn and the Sega Dreamast. Even when the Dreamcast was set to launch, people feared it wouldn't last long. Ultimately they were proved right. Sony and Nintendo (not to mention Microsoft) were just too big, and their advertising too effective. And let's not forget one of the hard and fast rules of commericalism: original ideas don't usually make money. Let's face it, most of the games to come out for these new game systems were copy-cat versions of previous games (don't get me started on the sequel subject, just how long do we have before Tony Hawk 22 and Tomb Raider 13 come out anyway?). But unlike the game systems that now rule...Dreamcast was something different.

New additions to the series are automatic jumping and Z-targeting. The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzle-solving and dungeon arrangement. You also build your attributes, receiving items including the Ocarina, learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling. Along with mini-games, hidden items and side quests equal, its a worthwhile experience. Graphics-wise, Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding. No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates, but rather focus on detail and designer talent. The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive. The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format. The themes of Zora's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears. Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby. A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.

The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.

A PERFECT recreation of an awesome arcade game, complete with Soul Calibur quality graphics, sweet controls, crystal clear sound, and awesome arcade gameplay. Of course the best thing about this game is that you won't have to insert any quarters time and again in order to unlock all the awesome hidden vehicles and tracks. It DOES get hard later on, but isn't that what an arcade game is supposed to do?
I'm actually replaying the game, I already beaten both of the two first worlds in under an hour. But it is a really good experience to play this old jewel again! I also own four other Spyro games: Spyro: Ripto's Rage, The Year of the Dragon (Both of thouse for my old Playstation and are VERY fun!) along with the alright, but not the same: Hero's Tale, and the crappy game some idiot thought up: The Legend of Spyro: A New Beggining. I despised thouse two games for what they had done to that cool, little dragon we use to know.
Firstly, F-Zero X Is not as complex model wise as other racing games at the time. Wipeout and its look alikes were typically much better looking games in the model department. However,  Where F Zero X lacks in the model complexity department it makes up for in the sheer amount of activity due to numbers of vehicles on the track. At any given time there are 29 other vehicles on the track (maybe a few less, some die real fast) racing against you or flat out trying to kill you.
4362	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Age of Mythology series is definitely the best ever sires of real time strategy games.  In all versions of the game you are allowed to control both the armies and economies of your nation.  You can build buildings, creature soldiers or peasants, even priests.  Your peasants you command to do the different menial tasks such as farming, mining, and building castles.  While your armies roam the land either defending your peasants, sieging enemy castles, or raiding their peasants.  Priest have the power to convert both peasants and soldiers.  If you like being king of the world, this is for you.  Finally, I just want to differentiate between the games.  Age of Empires is the oldest of the games and should run on any computer, but I wouldn't recommend the game without either the Rise of Rome Expansion Pack or just buying the Age of Empires Gold Edition.  These two correct many problems with the original Age of Empires.  Next game up the latter for medium computers is Age of Kings (that's what I'm still playing.) It can run on just about any computer with sixty four megs of ram and a two hundred megahertz processor.  I use it on a five hundred megahertz and a one point four gigahertz.  Next game up is the Age of Mythology.  This introduces a whole new realm of playing to the sires.  This one you civilization chooses different gods to worship and is given power from them.  Unfortunately you only get two really spectacular god powers each game and you can only use them once, but then it keeps the game to more strategy and less luck and wildcards.  (It is fun to get the wildcards when you have them though!)  This game should have a processor of I would say at least a six hundred and a graphics card at least thirty two megabytes; and lastly this is not the game for everybody.  I still use Age of Kings/Conquerors not because of my computer, but because I don't like all the crazy stuff in Mythology; I think it distracts from the medieval battle tactics.  Really choosing between Mythology and Age of Kings is just a matter of personal opinion.  I'd say download both demos and try them both; or if you have the money to blow, buy them both.  Either way I think you'll love both of them.  Well that's all for me.  This is just a general over view don't take my words as gold check out the specs and requirements yourself.  I just wanted to help point you in the right direction.

You set traps in a castle (in which you can add on rooms and chambers) to get peoples souls where you trade them in for money or use them to create monsters and stuff.  I loved this game it was dark, scary and fun!!

You take control of different armies and conquerers, such as Ghengis Khan or Barbarossa. Though it may be difficult controlling huge armies at one time, you get use to it. Age of Empires II also has a different control interface that you need to get used to: left-click selects, right-click commands. Taunts are added to this game; they are mostly for fun. Some taunts are: "Raiding party!", "Nice town; I'll take it.", and "It is good to be the king." Overall, Age of Empires II is a great game. I recommend it to strategy game- lovers who are quick with their mouse.

By the  time I got bored about halfway through Eye of the Beholder III, I thought  I'd had it with AD&D.  But then I saw so much written about BG, and  from the reviews, etc. I knew I would love it, so I rushed out and bought a  new PC, and BG (bundled with TSC) was the first thing I loaded.
Beautiful landscapes  and exciting roller coaster like transports from one island to another  makes this game enjoyable and exciting.
The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do.
The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I've ever seen, the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway.

This commentary on "Ocarina of Time" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999.  I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it.  Mike London, November 3, 2007
Graphically the old game is showing its age, I must admit. The 640x480 resolution and low-bit sprites are all here, but strangely enough it did not detract from the overall experience one bit. For all you "What are you crazy, 640x480? This ain't the stone age!" people who might pass up on this game because the graphics are dated, do no despair! There is a great mod/upgrade for Baldur's Gate called BGtutu which converts the engine to the newer Baldur's Gate II engine, with dramatic effect.
GoldenEye has never left my 64 rotation and again, I still love to play the multi player when my friends come over. I will again stress to those of us who are parents (like myself) that you should maybe think otherwise if you have some young gamers because it is very violent and very bloody. For those of you without that restriction, go wild and get this game. You won't be disappointed.
Music: Some of the best music ever is on the soundtrack. One track, Aeris's Theme is worth the price of it alone. This song can't be put into words, one of the most beautiful compositions I've ever listened to(and it's played in a sad scene but I won't spoil it). But this soundtrack also included a wide variety of music like rock(Boss Battle Theme)New age sounding(City of the Ancients), funk like(Wall Market) to ominous(Those Chosen By The Planet).
Crash's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game, including well-textured environments and colorful characters. Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy. The visuals are the game's only saving grace. Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn't use analog. You're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.

From the gorgeous visuals and multiple lighting scenes for every level (Vemom and Rapter Classes), to the awesome, awesome, AWESOME soundtrack (my favorite soundtrack of any racing ever), Wipeout was perfect.

4869	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	This rumble pak is too big, uses up batteries rapidly, it's so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble, Nintendo should have built-in rumble in thre controllers this sucks.
Be warned, this game is HUGE, it goes on for ages and never gets  boring. The slight downside is that there's a section at the end on Xen,  the alien planet which changes tack too much and can be frustrating to  complete.
As for the gameplay, that's great too. The difficulty can challenge and even frustrate you, but you'll be coming back for more. If I have to say anything bad about the game, Dixie Kong is not here yet and there are no digitized voices. There are grunts and cries, but no actual words.

4602	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When Quake 2 originally hit the PC, it's unabashed violence and surprisingly addictive gameplay not only outshined it's predecessor, it killed it before it hit the ground.  The PS1 and N64 conversions took much longer than expected to be released, and fans of the PC game anxiously awaiting the home versions were a little worried about the quality of the home system versions.  When Quake 2 hit the PS1, those fears were dead in the dirt.  Activision, Hammerhead, and Id all did a fantastic job bringing Quake 2 to the PS1 while keeping a surprisingly smooth frame rate (although the graphics aren't as good as its PC counterpart, but that was expected) and the unabashed violent addictive gameplay remains intact.  The game makes excellent use of the PS1's Dual Shock controller; the controls are easy and every button is to be used.  While some parts can be frustrating and the game has a rather steep learning curve, Quake 2 is still undeniably fun.  Those still holding on to they're PS1's can find this bad boy at a rather cheap price and have a great time with this near classic FPS.

Anyone who first experienced the game back in its height of popularity knows that Doom wasn't just a game, but a phenomenon. It has always consumed gamers (and continues to do so) into its ever addicting gameplay without compromise. The premise here is really simple: A base on Mars is attacked by Demons through a portal from Hell, and so the higher ups send the whole military platoon in to take care of the situation while you stand guard at the portal entrance. Of course, everyone gets wiped out except for you and now it's your job to go in and eliminate every last one Hell's minions. Yeah, it's a dumb story and it was eventually improved drastically with Doom 3 many years later, but the one aspect that makes these older Doom games superior to Doom 3 is that its simplistic storyline allows you to pick up the game from the get-go. There's no 30-minute CG cutscenes to introduce the game to you. There's no hour-long tutorial demonstrating how to play the game. No, immediately upon starting you're thrusted right into gameplay, and quite honestly I wouldn't have it any other way. Doom is to 3D what Contra is to 2D gaming: an instant, immersive, and entertaining experience, albeit somewhat mindless.

Well, you don't have to do it in your mind anymore. Not only that, you also get the most overwhelming of all opponents, the Borg - and the chance to team up against them.

I went down to my local "Funcoland"(yeah that long ago! remember them?) and picked up a copy. No one knew what Silent hill was about and at that time good luck finding something about it on the internet. All I had to go on where my whims and what the back of the case told about the game.

There is a lack of puzzles, and the bosses are pretty simple.  I guess I'm the person that likes RPG's like Zelda and Grandia II.  The story is ho-hum, but once you get into it, the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with.  That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two.  Also, the graphics and sound are good.  My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English.  (That is if you have the language set on English.)  I'm not sure of this, but I AM sure that their oral movements definately aren't matching what they say.  Overall, it's worth the price.

I am a bad puzzle solver and luckily, (With the exception of the pyramid of the sun dial puzzle) none of the puzzles are that hard.  The graphics are quite nice and the levels are gigantic and tempt lots of exploration.  All of the characters are well done and interesting.  The music is nice and you have a lot of neat weapons to choose from.  However this game does have some flaws.  First off, sometimes you will be walking around wondering what the heck you are supposed to be doing.  Second, some of the enviorments are way too big.  The third and biggest flaw is that the last levels are way out of place.  The 2nd to last is strange but acceptable, but the last level is wayyyy out of place.  The last flaw is that the ending is really dissapointing.  Overall this is a fun game that will take up a lot of your time and is definatly one of the better Lucasarts titles.
As with a lot of RPG's, it's not very good. I, and many will play through again for the positives I mentioned above, but there's really no incentive to come back and play through the 25+ hour quest again. Only for the hardcore RPGer, I guess.

Infact TR2 is the most playable game of all the TR's. It dosn't have those irritating dark scenes too much. Lara actions are better. And the puzzles are better thought out.  I'm also a fan of Far Eastern art. So the last levels realy felt good to explore. I'm giving this 4 stars because alot of the levels, although great to play, don't have the original soul of Tomb Raider.

613	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Twisted Metal 3 is overrated - because it's not normally considered the worst Playstation game.  I can't believe how unfun this game is.  The  control is laughable.  The gameplay is incredibly boring.  The music is Rob  Zombie, which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row.  The  game also adds almost nothing new.  Don't even rent this one.
This game sounds great also. YOu can hear the rifle reverb, all vechicles sound different and it has very interesting mood music.
  The game will take roughly twelve hours to complete the first run through without a strategy guide.  I advise you to listen to all the Codec conversations and watch all the cinematics because this is where the game truly shines.  It's story.  With six times the lenght of the average Hollywood thriller, the story is developed much more, and the characters are fleshed out far better than in any film I can think of.
FYI, in addition to the game itself, there are also tons of "third-party" addons available online.  If you like the original Star Trek series, do a google for "elite force space station k7" and you'll find some great classic trek add-ons for this game, for example.
This game is a cleaner, crisper version of SimCity 2000,  perhaps an update, but in no way a new game in the series.
Feel the power of creating a coaster with an excitement rating of 7.5, intensity of 7 and a nausea rating of 4.
Before I start, I want to get a few things straight. Unfortunatly, Sega made the Dreamcast its last system. The Sega Saturn turned most people away from the Dreamcast, mainly because the Saturn (...). Production of Dreamcasts has stopped. This is why I own two. Sega moved from a First-Party developer to a Third-Party. They have started producing games for other systems, starting with Sonic Adventure 2 on the GameCube and Sonic Advance for the Game Boy Advance. Why they're hugging onto Nintendo, I don't know, but I thank them for not going to Sony or Microsoft. With that said, let's start talking about the game.

The computer stinks.  I could beat them playing as GDI(good guys), which is hard because NOD(bad guys) has all the best vehicles, units, and structures.  I love the Missile Silo.  Talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent!!  If you want to have about a 65% chance of winning, stick with NOD.
8349	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I thought originally the size of the files for the game just wouldn't load onto my laptop with a lot of space was taken. Now I have a brand new desk top and the disk will not even begin to upload on to the desktop.
As Nintendo's last home console to use cartridges and their first console to use 3D 64-bit graphics, it became a major success. Its games set the status quo for many 3D platformers, 3D racers, and adventure games to come.
If you're familiar with the way Sonic 1 plays, then you know how to complete this game. However, they added a critical improvement in Sonic 2, which is the spindash. All you do is crouch down (By holding the bottom d-pad) and hit the jump button to start spinning, and when you release both buttons to go much faster than without the spindash. With the spindash, you can also plow into most Badniks and they'll get destroyed.
The other main deviation the game takes from the platformer genre is in its level design. Through the use of foreground and background objects, Aladdin can search behind (or in front) of these to discover 1-ups, health pickups, gems (which are used to buy more 1-ups and continues), or more apples. This works exceedingly well, considering it adds depth, not only to the visuals, but to the actual level design and overarching gameplay. I consider this aspect (much like many other aspects of Aladdin) absolutely revolutionary for its time. This was the very first Genesis game I played, and at the time, I was so used to games that didn't have any visual depth to them, that this idea of searching behind background objects absolutely blew my mind. Like I said, it's still impressive to this day. I still think it's absolutely revolutionary.

It is not enough to even call them "classics".  They're not only absolute top quality puzzle-style games, but they have great stories, unique and original characters and settings, and beautiful graphics.

-Secondly, the story itself. X4's storyline is very well put together. It starts out with Magma Dragoon destroying sky lab and bringing it down on a city full of people, killing them. X and Zero, of course, demand to know why a reploid of the repliforce caused this terrible catastrophe. However, Colonel (2nd leader of the repliforce) refuses to surrender to X, and so the entire repliforce wages war against the Maverick Hunters. This was all really caused by Sigma, who was playing both sides to get them to fight each other. I like the addition of the sub-characters (Double and Iris), and how they play key roles in each of the main characters' storylines. I won't reveal any more of the story, so as not to spoil the game endings.
9444	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To me this is the best version of Ms. Pac-man to date. It holds 100% true to the classic. That is if you want it to. You are givin' alot of options which allow you to play on different types of mazes. There are BIG ones, MINI ones, STRANGE ones & CLASSIC ones too. I liked the STRANGE mazes, there was even a maze that hardly had any walls and Ms. Pac-man was out of control. It was cool though. The two player mode is GREAT! You and another player can clear a maze together or alternating. But be careful, if you play simultaneously you run the risk of bumping into one another, this sends you both flying in opposite directions. In this case you could easily go flying into a ghost and lose a life. With all that being said remember if you just want to play the classic original it's all here in this one super game pack. Where would we all be if Ms. Pac-man didn't swallow?
Where it falls short of VII is the plot, which just isn't as good, mainly because you don't meet the final boss until the very end of the game (also a criticism of IX).  She really has little to do with the game until the closing hours, and it could have been thought out a little better.  As for the main character Squall, he is a little stereotypical for the genre, an angst ridden teenager, with many personal issues, not original but it still works.  These are only minor criticisms and on the whole this game, like its predecessor, is amazing.

7995	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Donkey Kong series was a very big part of my childhood.  I was obsessed with trying to beat all the levels, find all the bonus barrels, and beat all the lost world levels...and donkey kong country 3 is no exception.  Its hard to pick a favorite of the 3, but i think it would be this one.  You play as dixie kong and the very strong toddler kiddie kong, bc donkey and diddy have been kidnapped.  You start out swimming around a lake to find wrinklys save spot and the general store which you can buy special items from.  Also theres funky's place and now he has a motor boat for you, and as you find special items he can make you better forms of transportation, including a hovercraft and a jet ski.  Unlike the other games... you can now travel in a non linear pattern for the most part..sometimes you can choose which world you would like to complete first.  The levels are fun and challenging, and each one has 2 bonus levels and a hero coin to collect...which consists of a croc with armor and a shield which is the hero coin and you are given a barrel and have to find a way to make him guard the other way so you can throw the barrel and knock him out, thus collecting the hero coin, this is sometimes hard to do which adds to the fun.  There are bear coins to collect throughout the level, and sometimes you have to search all over the level as they may be well hidden.  You can spend the bear coins at the general store or and the mini game spot called swankys sideshow.  I remember this was the most fun part for me when i was a kid bc its like visiting a carnival and you play a little game where you have to throw balls at croc targets and you play against cranky.  If you win you win tons of bananas and bear coins...so much fun.  This game takes a while to complete and can get frustrating at times...but is a great pick for anyone who has a super nintendo.  If you like mario and the other donkey kong games...then give this one a try youll like it
If you really want a PS2, XBox or GC, I suggest waiting until they drop their price which they most likely will. I do not think those consoles are worth that much.
At certain times in the year, there are little festivals you can go to, as well as competitions you can compete in. There are horse races, dog races, a swimming race, an "easter egg" hunt, vegetable competition, and other things. In the winter, you can't grow any crops outside. Your only option is if you have built the greenhouse. Having the greenhouse allows you to grow any crop at any time of the year. If you don't have it, the mine opens for a certain amount of time, and you can use that to attempt to make money.

It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.

7334	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	For those who don't know this is a portable platforming Mario game for Gameboy. Simple controls, A to jump, B to run or use fireballs and the directional pad to duck and move. This feels like a mix and sequel to Super Mario World in terms of look and gameplay. They did a lot with the gameboy's limitations. This is an amazing game by any standard let alone the original tiny, hard to see Super Mario Land for Gameboy. This game offers bigger, detailed graphics, new enemies, new moves, new power ups (like the flying carrot), and a whole new land to explore with 20+ levels to beat. Mario Land is divided into 6 sections, the moon, the tree, the house (Mario is shrank), the pumpkin (which is haunted), the sea, and the mechanical statue of Mario. Each of these sections has a few levels, complete with a boss. The great thing about this game is the diversity, rather than Super Mario World which recycled the same background graphics in each level, Super Mario Land 2, each level has a different theme, like being in a bee hive, underground, a haunted house, a witches workshop, a lake, the moon and so on. There is no multi-player mode. It's a fun game, with all of the new enemies and challenges, and there are two exits to each level, a normal exit and an exit that leads to a bonus round with one of 2 games (crane game or a mouse hunt game) for items and 1-Ups. It is also a fairly quick game too, when you get good at it, the game will only take 4 hours get up to the boss (who is Wario). The other bosses are very cheesy, and they are a giant bird, a witch, an octopus and so on. There are no Color Gameboy features and there are 3 battery save slots (it instantly saves after each level).

It would be hard for those who weren't around in the late 90s to understand.  But when this thing came out it was so HUGE I would even have to put it in the top 10 video games of all time, easily.

The graphics and audio in this game are superb and DOESN'T look like a PS1 game one bit...and that's a good thing. The game sports beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds and the characters are very well designed. The gameplay is what's different from most platformers...you can't jump on people or shoot people. This isn't Mario or Metroid here this is Abe. You have to defeat enemies by either possessing them with your mind and walking them off ledges, walking them into traps, or just plain old avoid them. You can hide in shadows as well. You have to save your pals by having them help you turn valves etc.
Thankfully if you don't -want- to be freeing him, you don't have to. By virtue of the game's multiple endings, you're allowed to do what you believe is 'right'. Albeit containing dated graphics, a massive amount of space required to save (almost an entire card) and loading times comperable to a presidential term, it's a really good game. It does allow you a few choices in regard to storyline, but its real gem is trap upgrading, a castle building system and the ability to create various creatures to serve you. If only it had more plot flexibility... I would've had no qualms donating some of my funds gotten off of squashing merchants to fund a family's operation to save their ailing daughter, but no, I have to kill them -too-. Such is the price of undynamic scripting.
The storyline is also very entertaining and satisfying. You are always joining up with people and other characters betray you! The cut-scenes develop the characters very well and the plot was thought out very well, too. I always want to keep playing to find out what happens next!
6970	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven. What the hell happend??? I first brought the MK Trilogy on PC. But after I upgraded to Windows 98 the game would not install anymore, it only worked on Win 95. So I saw the playstaion version, but I never liked the PS and I saw that it was exactly the same as the PC version.. so I figured the N64 version would be just the same.... wrong!!!! There is about 20 charactors missing from the 64 version for some unknown reason. They could well have included them but for some reason this game is more like Mortal Kombat 3 with a few extra charactors.
- The entrances are very dodgy.
The music in this game is fantastic as well. Some tracks that especially stick out are DK isles, Jungle Japes and Fungi Forest. The quality of the music makes the game play value even better. (They made a Donkey Kong 64 soundtrack but unfortunately it's not in the bundle.)
I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to "ignore".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that "ignore" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a "load" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system.

This is the Survival Horror god.  RE3 is perhaps the most scary(insert shocking here) game of the series I have played yet.  Rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas, Nemisis, the big, bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game.  I still remember fondly the first time I saw his distorted face.  And I remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench.  He is scary.

1078	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	What isn't great about this game? I'm so glad that this game has so many reviews because it definitely deserves it. Ocarina of Time remains one of my favorite videogames of all time. Yes, the generation of gaming is getting wider and graphics are getting beautiful with each console but The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, on N64, doesn't add up to them. Well, at least to me it doesn't. I've seen a few 1 star reviews about people bashing the game only because it's no "everquest" or "Halo". This game is so good that you don't compare its style or graphics with something in today's modern gaming. This is an old school game. You just don't compare old games to new ones. I believe there's a favorite for every generation. This one happened to fall into the N64 genre, when gaming was really starting to pick up. And honestly, you think over 700 5-star reviews were written all by children? We were children when we all played the game! And looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history. Kids that didn't get to exprience the NES, SNES, and N64 missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome there's nothing on the classics.

I don't really remember much of the music. Recently, I was able to use VGMusic (great site) to listen to F-Zero X MIDIs, and based on what I heard, it didn't seem very impressive. Perhaps it's because these rock-like guitar riffs don't appeal to me. Give me soft jazz, western, or classic any day! Sound effects stick better in my mind, and they are pretty good. The thing that sticks out the most is probably the wail as you fall...off...the...track...KABOOM! Visually, F-Zero X had been kind of lacking. The textures were bleh, and the backgrounds were just fog or clouds. Even though it's not visually or aurally appealing, F-Zero X is still an extremely fun game to play.
The game can be played by just about anyone.  Sure you can't save but you've got to remember the games AGE!  Saving wouldn't become a norm until the early 90's in the day and age of the SNES.

The story goes something like this: X, a new breed of robot who can think and make decisions on his own, was unearthed from the remains of an ancient laboratory by Dr. Cain. Fascinated by X, Cain produced his own series of these robots, ignoring the risks. Several of them became Mavericks and began disobeying human orders. To counter this, Cain built Maverick Hunter robots, led by the ultra-powerful Sigma. Unfortunately, after Sigma battled a mysterious red robot called ZERO, he too became a Maverick, bringing Cain's worst fears to life. Oddly enough, Zero went back to normal and joined X. Together they set out to destroy all of the Maverick bots. Unfortunately, Zero was destroyed in action, forcing X to continue alone. Once he ultimately stopped Sigma, he realized the battle was only beginning. It would be continued in future Mega Man X games.

4832	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Even when it first came out, Delta Force wasn't really a groundbreaking game. However, what it may have lacked in graphics and animation accuracy, it more than made up for in sheer joy of gameplay. Even though I no longer play it online, and play it in single-player mode with my 4-year-old son, we both find it incredibly enjoyable. The missions are difficult enough to provide suitable challenge, especially since, if you're not careful and wary, one single bullet can kill you - just like in real life. None of the ridiculous "hit point" meters and other nonsense like in other FPS-type games. However, the missions are also short and sweet - perfect for those like me who don't have the time to invest in hours-long missions of stealth like in Operation Flashpoint.
For 1992 and 1993, this game was good as far as graphics go. They were crisp and not jagged like they were for the NES Zeldas, though Link was rather small and indistinguishable. Because of the exiting game play and nostalgic value this is one of my all-time favorites.

(if you don't have one and want this game, I strongly suggest you get one either by itself or with another great game, Donkey Kong 64 which is now a steal at .... If the expansion pak is ... by itself, you do the math.) The controls are superb, and it's very easy to get the swing of things. However, it is very bloody and the deaths are realistic. Parents should let kids under sixteen rent it, then watch them play it to make sure it's ok. Other than the blood, there is some mild swearing at about the PG-13 level, it's nothing too bad. Multiplayer is fantastic, with 'Capture the Briefcase' the best scenario.

This one is for you. I can't even think about a single reason why the Playstation's/PS2 popularity is continuing when the DreamCast has a much better mascot and a great game like this.

STORY:
I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one. This game is incredible. Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front. Not only that, but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome: samurai, ninjas, bears, wolves, dogs, and all kinds of demons. This game is totally awesome, if a bit slow though. It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in "Devil May Cry", it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime. Oh well, it was still a good game. If you're a true ninja fan, you must have this game... you won't regret it.

By today's standards, the graphics are dated, but I still play through this game from time to time, and I thoroughly enjoy it every time.
The game becomes more enjoyable the better you are able to master your ninjitsu skills. The controls are difficult to master at first, but stick with it and you will eventually be rewarded. I used to just jump off a roof and try and hack at my enemy. Now I can do a reverse back flip off a roof behind an enemy and exact a perfect kill. Far too cool.
5651	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was the first RPG I ever played and ~10 years later, I'm still playing it over. It's fun and the bosses are challenging although the final bosses is pretty easy to kill. The last time I played, I made it a mission to beat Ultima Weapon as I consider that to be the equivalent of beating the game and then some. I think this game has the most realistic feel out of all the FF games I've played. Sure, there are monsters, a lady that looks like a witch, magic and other unrealistic things but the world it is set in seems very possible to me and I think that's what initially drew me in. Plus, I think the opening sequence was the best out of any FF to date.

1453	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Making a City, it's a change for once. I like this game because it gives easy control, and it's fun to play. There are some down-sides to it too, like it takes too long to make a big city, and Sims complain tooooo much, but it's all good other then that. My favorite thing to do is save the city, then rip it down by disteasters. The good thing is you don't have to save it after you destory it. This game can be easy or hard, like if you want to make a big city, it takes time, and it's hard, but if you use codes like:I am weak, Call coison Vinnie, I love Red Tape, Power to the masses, Water in the desert, Garage in garage out, and nardz rool(actually spelling) it's eazy (...). Graphics, well it isn't that good on making small sims, but good on everything else, 9/10 Fun, a very fun game, isn't has fun as some games, but it's cool,7/10 Gameplay, well, if you like making cities, then it has long gameplay, 8.5/10 Sound, I really like the sound because it makes me think more,9.5/10 Overall, you would love this game, but it's fun isn't like some games 8.5/10 which is Great/Awesome and 4 stars for Sim City 3000!
As the game is less focused on the items, the battle modes are a bit drawn-out and boring. However, Fire Mountain and Smokey Castle are brilliant. In Fire Mountain, your goal is to take eggs to your nest and make sure they hatch. The game becomes frantic with the addition of the ability to steal your opponents' eggs. In Smokey Castle, you must take 10 bananas (2 at a time) to your respectable treasure chest. It's not as awesome as Fire Mountain, but it's fun just the same. Graphics are actually decent for 1997. It may not be as visually stunning as what Rare would achieve in half a year with Banjo-Kazooie, but the game looks nice nonetheless. Most early Rare games have lousy backgrounds, but DKR's backgrounds are impressive. The music is terribly catchy, and the voice samples are cute. The Silver Coin Challenge is still unfair.
1546	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game is interesting.  My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with.  If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it.

Give it a shot on your PS2 if you haven't.  It's a bargain.
What surprises many is learning that an American team made this game.  Yes, not the Japanese company.
This was also a time when computer capabilities and capacity seemed to double every few months. Final Fantasy VII is the result of an inevitable synergy between technology and imagination. Players found themselves in a three-dimensional world where they could wander at will. They were playing with characters that were not only more animated and lifelike, but also had something that resembled personalities. In a very real sense, FFVII changed the gaming landscape, and RPGs reached a new level of credibility.

The Soul continues to burn bright and those who still have their Dreamcast should own this game.  It is not just one of the best games you can find on the system, but still remains as one of the greatest games ever made.

Rool.

- It's another game that has completely ignored Hulk Hogan's Leg Drop as being a devastating finisher, it's simply just a running leg drop that doesn't even look like the height Hogan would do it from and I don't know if I've ever seen Hogan pull off a standing drop kick before. It's just an average leg drop with little damage.
You explore all the rooms, find some clues, and arrive to an elevator.  You click to go to the third floor but the door is locked, so you have to go back.  You try the second floor and once again, you can't go through the door so you have to go back to the elevator.  You think to yourself "okay, this is just strange".  Back inside the elevator, for some unexplainable reason, a 4th floor suddenly becomes an option, so you go there.  You ask yourself "was that 4th floor ALWAYS there?"  This time, when you come out of the elevator the door isn't locked, and you're allowed to enter the floor.  Once you enter that floor you WISH that calm, snowy daytime scenery from a few moments ago was still around because now you're in a dark haunted hospital surrounded by nurses with knives constantly slashing at you, floors that have been turned into gates and dreary walls soaked in blood all over every room in the hospital, and the music that plays here is simply amazing the way it makes you think about blood just waiting to ooze from all over the place.

3098	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I would first like to begin with a short complaint of those that dislike this game, but don't say why.  All we ever here from those that 'hate' the game is, "bad graphics, bad storyline, bad gameplay".  To be quite honest, one should not be writing a review on a game if one does not state reasons why the game is in fact, so good, or so bad.  If you are trying to persuade someone to not like a game, then give the facts WHY something stinks, just don't say it does.  Filling games with bad reveiws just gives a bad rap for no reason, for all of you who didn't in fact like this game, fill out a review with enough detail to describe what made the game so bad.

This game is great on the Dream Cast if you have a light gun, if you don't this game is not good. The user interface for the game was designed for a light gun, so if you play with a controller it seems unnatural and you have a desaster almost as big as trying to play Virtual On without the twin sticks. ...

Replay value is high, because you can play the game with a different personality, play style, and different companions.  The game may seem to have dated graphics, but the sound is still top-notch, and the game programming is robust.  Load times may be hard to stomach, but it should be easier if you follow online instructions to move the entire game from CD to hard drive or virtual CD.

Throw the ability to play on the net into the mix and you've got Unreal Tournament.  Quake 3's boring, gothic levels and gameplay can't even compare to what UT has to offer.

Now, I'm sure you're wondering how playing a video game can quote unquote "help" you. A few years ago I picked up a copy of the original Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo at the same store but when I played through it something felt a bit off. I just wasn't enjoying myself to the point I did when I played the game when I was younger. I wasn't sure if the problem was me or if it was the game... all I knew was I was going to have to play another game in the franchise (as a point of reference) to find out. Fast forward a few years when I got around to this and well, I had a blast. After completing Donkey Kong Land III I played a few more games like Donkey Kong Country 2 on the GameBoy Advance and the original Donkey Kong Land and those only solidified the weird fact that I don't like the first SNES game for some reason. Unfortunate (and bizarre) as that is I'm glad the whole series hasn't shared its fate.

6130	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Thanks to Nintendo's bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the 32-bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems, we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there.  True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and  bad third-party support, no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it.  And I hate Playstation, but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N64.  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system, they also had to turn many classic 2D games and  turn them into horrible 3D games (Like Earthworm Jim 3D, Zelda, Donkey Kong  64, Kirby, Rayman 2, and so much more...)!  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it.  Sometimes the controll's bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game.  Plus because the games are in  cartriges (Lousy sound and space because of this) they cost [a lot]  and the games are usally short and don't last more than a couple of hours  before you're finished with the game.  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made.  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing (I still think once was too painfull) at a friends house.  Complete waste of money.  I do not recomend.  Let's hope the Nintendo Cube  Box turns out better than this piece of trash.
Graphics-wise, it's all a let-down, i was expecting  realistic models but i got cartoony characters, but then again- it's mario  and friends, right?
The level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration. Mario will find himself in sunken ships, caves with toxic gas, inside a volcano, a pyramid, in a desert, a fortress in the sky, sliding down slippery snowy slopes, and even inside a giant strange clock. This game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay. I don't believe I've ever met anyone that didn't find this game fun to play.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
Although I didn't play Everquest as much as the other two titles, I found the entire system to be lacking.  The controls and console didn't seem to flow as much as Asheron's Call and Ultima Online.  Furthermore, while the game has better graphics than the other two titles, it didn't feel "3-D."  It had a still feel to it and didn't provide much 3-D stimulation.
Graphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful.  The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air.  Though many stages take either a purely generic "spacial" theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive.  In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the "wavy" effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works!  The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can "warp" to.  Though it probably looks like you've taken a medication or something else you shouldn't have, you can't deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it's dependent upon your actions in the levels.

-Loads of things to do
By today's standards, the graphics in this game are quite primitive, but at the time they were absolutely amazing.  The 2D backgrounds are still great to look at today, as well.  The music in this game is also great, despite the rather limited selection of sounds Nobou Uematsu had at his disposal.  Of particular note is the song that plays during the final boss encounter, "One Winged Angel", which is still beloved by Final Fantasy fans today.

TEKKEN FANS WILL LOVE THIS ONE A LOT.
What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.

Hmmmmmm. Insidious.

Anything that moves can be clicked on and examined.  The level of precision and the amount of choices that you have in this game are fantastic, and sometimes overwhelming.  The game consists of twenty-some scenarios that gradually get harder.  Each time that you finish one, you get a new challenge, which keeps the game from getting too easy as you become more proficient.
Eventually, you have a boss fight that, thanks to mistranslation, tells you to ATTACK WHILE it's tail is UP. If you do this, the boss will hit a party member, causing you to do the battle the opposite of how they intended. You might even game over. After that, more dialog, and you get to make a choice with Aeris: "You'd better get out of here" or "Nothing...hey, listen...". This affects a cutscene WAY, WAY down the line from here. I never made the connection until recently.

I had never played the first Kirby's Dream Land because it was very hard to find where I lived, and I sure didn't want to miss out on this installment, which had 3 animal friends to help Kirby. Everything about the game looked great- it had some of the best graphics on the GameBoy, Kirby had a ton of powers, the animal friends all had their own versions of powers, and the game had a secret ending that could only be seen if you collected all the Rainbow Drops. Yeah, I couldn't wait to play this game, and I ended up getting it with some of my birthday money the year it came out. No other game had my attention until I beat Dream Land 2.

But luckily the Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have many friends who help them along the way. The smart-mouthed Cranky Kong is always there to provide a few laughs and tell some great stories. Funky Kong will give you a ride in his plane-like barrel that brings you to other worlds and levels that you want to play again or find the bonuses in. And Candy Kong is always there to save your game and blow you a kiss. There are also many animal friends such as Enguarde the swordfish, Rambi the rhino, and Winky the frog who help make the levels easier to beat.
The game is Donkey Kong Country but for the original game boy. The Graphics are pretty bad considering it was one of the later games in this library, and the game tends to be slow and messed up at times. The game itself isn't that bad, however it is just that the graphics ruin the game.

Unfortunately it crashes after a few minutes or hours so I haven't got to the end of the game ever. I've tried it on two different computers, one being way more poweful than the other one and it just won't play completely on either one. If it'd quit that, it'd be great.

Soul Calibur is the first 3D fighter that I felt is worth the buy. It has a deep storyline, as deep as fighting games get. It includes TONS of secrets that can be accessed by playing through the games on various modes. The graphics are the best you can find on ANY system. Buy the game if you even remotely like fighting games. If you don't... what is wrong with you?

2) Graphics: EXCELLENT!  I have never seen such excellent graphics for this type of game.  Everything fits perfectly.  There is blood after a soldier is killed, explosions are very dramatic, u can see the sparks as minerals are mined up by cutting SCV's.  When hurt, Zerg buildings bleed, etc (don't get the idea this is gory, its really not, just little red sparks on the screen when something is injured or killed)...  Everything casts a shadow, things can turn invisible, etc...  It's excellent!  The world's you play in our top notch as well.  Shadows, mountains, trees, animals wandering around, etc....  It truly works well for this type of game.  Graphics are top notch here (especially for when it was made).
The graphics in Riven look beautiful, even 15 years later. The Riven environment is gorgeous and has some really startling landscape. However, the geography in Riven is supposedly 5 times larger than Myst's, but because most of the game occurs within a single Age is actually does feel a bit smaller. Moreover, I felt like there were more "corridors", or areas that had no function other than to serve as space between two other areas. Myst by contrast was extremely compact. I'm not sure which is better, but I'd guess that in terms of puzzle content the two games were about equal. I would have preferred a bit more environment and fewer corridors.

With a game as old as this one is, it would be easy to find faults -- especially comparing those faults with current-gen gameplay mechanics and graphics. However, if one can allow themselves to enter the early PSX era, the true beauty of a game like Resident Evil can shine through. While not perfect, this game serves as the ultimate example of what survival horror is. RE set the stage for things to come, and its great to be able to go back and see the humble beginnings of some of the greatest plot elements and gameplay mechanics we enjoy in video games today.

Abilities: Mario can wall jump, long jump, and many more.
 The gameplay has been bad mouthed by many people as very unreponsive and the camera pan's are truly hated, but I found no real problems as I played it.  A good thing about this game is that you go up against demons and hellish creatures as...a normal human being.  You are not a cop, FBI agent or some special ops soldier.  You are Harry Mason, a writer caught in this mess.  You make a lot of noise when you walk, you get tired when you run, you don't shoot very well and you don't know what the heck is going on in Silent Hill.  This truly brings the realism to the game.

4234	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I own the new Warcraft III series from Blizzard, and other true 3D games like Emperor: Battle for Dune, from Westwood/EA games.  I say this because some of the older RTS games like Westwood's Command and Conquer series, Dune 2000, Blizzards own Warcraft II, and other games date badly.  You can see this in terms of the control problems, blocky graphics, clunky path finding, and (if you play online) nearly non-existent fan base.


 If you are tired of the Resident Evil games and wish to play a story that will plunge you into a hellish nightmare, buy this game.  This game is truly under-rated in that it did not get the spotlight it deserved.  And study up on the story behind Silent Hill, it is very interesting and this is a game I will add to my permanent collection.

This is an amazing game. One of the best for the 64. If you have competition around you can take up hours of play time.
Another problem that needs addressing is the camera. They should have focused as much on responsive camera movements as they did with the graphics. It often shifts when you don't want it to, and it is a bugger to get a strait focus. This also brings up the issue of the controls, which are harder to master than a new language. Getting Donkey Kong to dive properly underwater is enough to send your remote flying across the room.
With its close attention to detail, and its careful use of light and sound to enhance the experience, "Thief" is one of the most effectively immersive games I have ever played. I am reminded of the first time I played "Doom" or "Quake" and I saw the first glimmerings of what the FPS genre could do. "Thief" takes that concept and extends it much further, forcibly making the player pay closer attention, and thus get involved in the world of the game much more deeply than other games have ever required. "Thief" tasks the player to examine every shadow, jump at every little sound, and take chances on the best way through tight situations. Couple this involvement with a top quality storyline, worthy in itself of a big-screen treatment, and you've got a fantastic game -- which is exactly what "Thief" is: fantastic.
Bottom line......get the game!!!
You utilize two attacks; your flame breath, and your horn charge. Throughout the levels you encounter several types of enemies, but especially Gnorcs. Your goal throughout the game is to unfreeze all the dragons, and collect stolen dragon eggs from the taunting blue thieves. Each of the six homeworlds contains a non-mandatory boss battle (aside from the Gnorc Gnexus) and a balloonist who will transport you to the next homeworld. Your health meter is represented by a little dragonfly by the name of Sparx that follows you around. Sparx starts out bright yellow, dulls to blue, then to green, and once he is gone, you're toast. Lives are gained with small dragon statues, or collecting so many of a small silver orb dropped by previously defeated enemies.

It is just so much fun and it brings back alot of memories of when I was younger playing it.  This time I won't lend it to anyone so they can not give it back.  Awesome Awesome game.
Replay Value: This is one of those fighters that you come back to in like a week or so. The 2-player versus mode well definetly bring you back as well as the single player. All in all it's a great fighting game that should be played from time to time.
1420	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Surprisingly, when Nintendo created the N64 game system, they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be. The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time.
5810	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent city building game with a great Egyptian theme. Good progression in difficulty so that you don't get frustrated with the game. You start out managing a small village to create mega cities with their own wonder(s). The game produces walkers that give you feed back on your city such as such and such god might be unhappy or hey my market is overflowing with luxery items. You can click on the houses to see what is holding their development up. You can do overlays showing property value, distribution of goods and other such information. You create a trading empire managing where your goods go and what goods you are importing in for your citizens.
Everything is very cryptic
Now audio....I kid you not, after beating this game I downloaded almost every song from the game(Cosmo Canyon is by far one of my favorite songs ever played on a video game!!!).  The music is just beautiful, the song played in cosmo canyon is let alone a reason to get the game sountrack as well as the final battle with Sepheroth.  The best part about the audio is they fit perfectly well for every scenario/area/battle.  I do plan on buying this games soundtrack when I have the time..
Although Sonic 2 remains my favorite, this is without a doubt a close second. I know the graphics may seem somewhat dated today, but for 1991, this was pretty damn good. Bright, vibrant colors, and great atmosphere (love the city skyline in Star Light Zone). It goes from a bright, sunny atmosphere (Sun Light Zone) to a big industrial factory (Scrap Brain). Along the way, there are various icons that Sonic can smash open, and each one has a special power that Sonic can use to his benefit; 10 rings, super speed, temporary invincibility, a shield, and the holy grail of them all: the 1-up. The game also has catchy music. Okay, it's 2004 now, and we can hear actual bands in our games, but back then, we had video game music, and it was good and easy to tune out if need be. Also, in this game, you must collect 7 chaos emeralds in these weird, spinning worlds, and defeat robot enemies by jumping on them.
Game On.
5 stars.
This game is truly epic. The music is awesome. It's no par with FF7's music. It truly is some of the best. The battles are great. There are normal ones which are fun. You get to use 6 characters. Your party is up to you. Over the game you get 108 different characters, of which 2/3rds are playable in battle. There are also duels. Duels are fun. Wars are awesome in this game. There is alot going on. The graphics are well done. For a 2d game. There are tons of different good looking sprites. The story is also magnificent. My favorite story ever. You come to love the characters. The game also ends perfectly. It is a tear-jerker. Right after the final battle I may have teared a little. The game is fun though. If you see it buy it. The game is well worth it because it is my favorite game of all time. It beat out MGS on my list, so it's good.

The visual look and feel of this game is astonishing.  A 2D game has never looked this good.  Even so many years later the graphics look really good.  Some are a tad bit fuzzy but you'll quickly get over that.

Weapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use L2 and R2 (strafe buttons) to select the weapon. I would have preferred a radial menu instead. Some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see. Thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black. I found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic, some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxes.
If Rareware hadn't made the characters so sugary, this could've easily topped Mario Kart 64 in recognition among the older crowd. Definitely worth a purchase used, and good luck to all those up for the challenge.

9574	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Definitely one of the better strategy RPG's I've played, but still difficult.  Not as difficult as the Disgaea strategy RPG series (THANKFULLY), but still pretty hard.  The plot and the "Job" system are very deep though and will definitely keep a lot of players busy.  Highly recommended.
GAMEPLAY:The bird-view camera is an interesting idea. In some respects it works so well. In others though it is tough. The way you walk is strange but cool as well. To walk forwards press X. To walk backwards press Square. Same with vehicles. While on foot press O to burp or fart. While in a car press O to honk the horn. You can hijack cars and buy upgrades for your cars. Finding weapons and killing civilians is an awesome addition to any game.

Now on to Myst.  My first experience with Myst was Riven.  After playing that game I felt the need to get the first one.  Sure enough!!!  It was available for the Playstation.

5571	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	this game is pretty fun.  The graphics are decent, the sound is also above average.  This game is at its best when 4 human players play in a 4 player multiplayer game.  Games are always high scoring when playing with your friends.  This game is a great game if you always have people who will play with you.  But when playing alone this game sucks.  Sure smacking the computer is fun a while, but theres no one to smack talk.  The novelty of hard hits wears off fast.  Also the no pass inerference rule gets cheap.  On easy mode, the computer gets whooped every time beacause they never pass interference, but on hard, the computer will use it on every play, making it frustrating, because it will be so freaking hard to cathc a pass.  For the person with no friends this game may not be right for you.  First of all this game has no season mode for 1 player.  its just arcade mode.  Secondly, there are no things to keep you busy like creat-a-player ( i believe there is create a play, but i would rather have more fun creating players ).  so get this game if you have lots of friends or if there are always people to play with you. if you don't have friends or you are a only child, stick with NFL2k for all you solo gamers.
Sound A-
Another true classic
Here's a list of-- in this fan's humble opinion-- the game's seven more memorable locations. #1 should come as a surprise to absolutely nobody.
But Gabriel Knight 2...wow, what a game. I played  it twice, something I never do with adventure games. But this one was SO  well written and conceived, and it was recognized by many folks as a Game  of the Year. It truly does immerse you in the story, and some of the final  movie sequences are superbly done. Great locations, great plot, definitely  a game you HAVE to play if you haven't already.
Wipeout XL takes what everyone loved about the original and upped it a notch. The graphics are higher Resolution, the music is more upbeat, the weapons are more lethal. But perhaps the greatest reason to play it is that it's REALY FAST. There is simply no experience on earth like playing Wipeout XL on Phantom Class (the fastest class) with the hidden class of ship (unforetunately it loses weapons in exchange for maxed-out stats).
Savian wasn't too good but Kevin was a little and it was fun with him. But my favorite cousin, Nick hasn't played in a long time. He was fantastic, just like me. The only thing we need practice at is reflecting items back.
OVERALL
Plus, it's got lots of  features without being over-engineered. I especially like the fact that it  comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach.  The button  cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed, with all major  buttons a comfortable distance apart.  The hat is cleverly devised as well,  being both solid and flexible.  Most importantly, perhaps, the software,  now at least two years old, is very stable, and allows you complete control  over each button.

I'm so hooked, I have a  carrying case for my Berry and Teal Gameboy Color and have those plastic  cartridge cases for my games. Get this and you'll have access to a lot of  great games!
4989	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When this game came out in '99 I was 15 years old. Let's just say it scared the crap out of me. Almost to the point where I didn't want to finish it. You play as Harry Mason as he searches for his missing daughter in Silent Hill. Sound simple enough? Well, Silent Hill is a town like no other. It's a town that's covered in fog and completely deserted. Just to set the tone for you; one of the first things you come across is a wheelchair in an alleyway with its wheels still rotating. Add that to the bloody gurney with an apparent body underneath and you're in for a ride. Don't go in expecting the best graphics as the game has aged terribly (it's been 15 years). One of the best things about the Silent Hill franchise is the high replay value that they offer. It's not a game where you beat it once and then put it on the shelf. There are multiple endings to be seen so you'll be playing this for a while. The music is superbly done and goes hand in hand with the atmosphere. Top notch game.
Gameplay: Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink "peace-loving" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible. The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.
Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).

  After using the wheel on this game for 2 weeks, i have to say that GT2 is THE best racing game out there for ANY system. And i should know, I have played it on the original playstation, the dreamcast and now PS2.
6810	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I gave this game 5 stars. Why? I'm partial to the guy in the spider suit! I find meaningless dribble that just take up time, such as side scrolling bash'n'beat games (The Punisher, Streets of Rage, ect) fun at times. This game teams you up with Spiderman and Venom. Both characters have the same talents, but it's fun to play a bad guy for once! It's a good waste of time. Really.
4696	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I played this game when it came out, and it astounded me. The flowers, the butterflies, the music, the story, the gameplay, were all astonishing. Baldur's Gate is still one of the greatest games of all time. It works just fine on computers that aren't brand new, and an internet fan base is constantly updating it. I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone under 12 or so; there's some real darkness here. There's also humor and, of course, magic. Like many RPGs (and unlike, say, Doom or Grand Theft Auto), it will appeal to women and girls. Save the world, make friends, find yourself, collect neat stuff, and kick some [tail] --what's not to love?
I am not saying that this is a bad game but if you have become hooked to say Fusion or Zero than this game is a step down for you (and if you only played Prime well avoid all together).  However if you are a die hard collector or are interested in the full story than this game is a must have in the legacy.  Just be warned it's short and sweet but with a hard edge (difficulty).
I really enjoyed John DeLancie's performance as the villain. I also enjoyed the depth of interaction between the main characters, and I am very impressed with the amount of research into esoterica that Jane Jensen put into this and the other games in the series. If you are at all of a mystic bent, or have any interest in what might be termed the occult, you will like this game.
really frustrating at times

9225	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This is a Mortal Kombat clone, with huge amounts of blood, and two fatalities for each competitor. The only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are pre-historic! Two apes, a big dinosaur, a fire breathing legendary dinosaur, a raptor and much more. The gameplay is much like Street Fighter 2, and the gameplay is very slow, because you are fighting as dinosaurs! Another interesting feature is that for those who like to use the same move over and over again, the game laughs at you. Pretty cheap game, rent it before you buy it.

The flight model of the dragon is very realistic.  I wonder if game makers have a real dragon hidden somewhere because they really get it right!  Truth is all the flying creatures in the game will make you take a few unnecessary shots as you attempt to sightsee!  Less interesting is walking thru narrow caverns on top of the dragon.  It's more fun to lead the striking female player character - named Rynn - around.  Judging by the looks of it she is definately into aerobics (check those buns gentlemen)!  I was amazed at her detail.  The fact is that everything looks superb!  Show this to your console-loving friends!  It's something of a graphics showpiece.  My PC is nothing special (AMD 350, RAGE128, 64 megs) and Drakan ran beautifully most of the time.  The movement can be jerky because of some faulty movement mechanics.  Nothing major, just a little irritating when jumping on slopes.
Super Metroid arguably has the better methodology for presenting a story during the game--after the intro and story segments right up to the very end, it's all rendered using the ingame engine, as we're prone to say today. The art of giving the same old ingame sprites a character all their own, and making us empathize with something so small is certainly an achievement, and it's rarely been done elsewhere. Fusion, as you might expect with GBA cartridge sizes rapidly approaching the size of a good size Neo Geo cart in terms of storage space, often adds cutscenes--some frames good, some in need of more colors. Overall, though, that approach seems overly preachy, with the nagging computer stealing far too much of your precious battery power. We understand, Nintendo--it's a common sin these days.

6406	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	You know you're in trouble when the first scenario after the tutorial pits you against three foes. If you've played a RTS before it's not that bad but if you're new to the genre it's the deep end of the pool. True, I'm more of a explore and build player but I was still disappointed with the difficulty of the campaigns. If a game wants to be difficult I'd prefer it be with good AI, not swamping you with an early rush or overwhelming numbers. There is a simple formula to win most scenarios: survive the early rush, create a defense and assault the computer opponents one at a time, and you'll win.


the main characters are Nancy (Trick), Slash (Balance), Jam (Balance), Linda (Speed), Wendy (Trick) and Tommy (Speed). Damian (Balance, I think), Mr. Dog (Speed) and the blue bird, Coach (Trick) are the hidden characters.

All of this was corrected by RE4 but that's about it for my complaints.
"Fallout 2" is a much larger game than the original,  and to make traversing the vast distances easier, after several quests you  actually get - wait for it - a car!  Many differently skilled NPCs are  eager to join you; how many you can have in your party depends on your  charisma.  Where you had little control over NPCs in your party in  "Fallout", in "Fallout 2" you can get them to wear improved armour, select  better weapons, and they sometimes actually increase their skills when your  character levels.  I developed a tight little bunch, consisting of the  loyal Sulik (give him a SuperSledge and watch him go!) and Vic (whose  Repair skill is essential until yours is developed, if you can tolerate his  sucking up and constant whining about Sulik), Cassidy (much better with  weapons than your character when you find him) and after I solved all his  town's problems, Marcus the Mutant, entertainingly voiced by Michael Dorn  (Worf from Star Trek).  Hint: if you do have Marcus join, take his minigun  away before he shreds your entire party and give him a more focussed  weapon, but he is very picky.

I love anything to do with the mind, especially when the mind goes haywire! So I love them more when they have to do with Mental Asylems, now refered to these days as Sanitariums(hint hint). Everything in this game, every little detail, has to do with the main characters struggle with memory loss, confusion, loss of indentity and questions about how reliable his sanity really may be.

A great feature is the amount of space warfare you get to do. I love that! As I was going through the game I started to feel a bit as though the missions were a little too easy, as I was using the same strategy for aboutt hree of them with success, but I realised that I has spoken too soon! I am right on the last part of the game now and I am finding it impossible to beat. I can't believe that after only just managing to beat one wave of ships, another one appears immediately with the same fire power.


For parents considering this game for their children, they should be aware of the violence. Much of the game is spent killing people, and the realism is striking. It is up to you, but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictive.
And did I mention the  cinematics? The dance scene in particular stands out in my mind as  completely amazing. I would restart there on purpose to see the detail they  put into the movements. If you love good animation, you could buy the game  just to go from scene to scene.
In short, get this game. It's a super fun one player game.
The game, although pretty average today, set the tone for future launch titles. I definitely suggest it if you are a PS historian or enthusiast.
2.) Sega has a huge userbase of Dreamcast users. As a profit-seeking company, there is no reason they would not try to capitalize on either licensing the Dreamcast.. or PARTNERING... there are rumors rumors rumors (substantiated) that the new Microsoft XBOX coming out this fall will infact have a Dreamcast chipset allowing the play of Dreamcast games.  This means that the production of Dreamcast software will not go kaput, becuase developers will still have a platform to develop for.

Overall, this could have been the best Star Trek game I've ever played. You get to be the good guys and the bad guys. Building ships, starbases, taking over ships, and unique weapons made it exciting. The bugs were the only problem. The game needs a patch to make it stop crashing or else people would have to play the game saving it every 5 minutes.

The gameplay is really exciting too-  it centers around tossing apples to stun enemies and smack them with your sword in fast-moving action/adventure style.  The later levels provide dangerous chase segments while riding the carpet and cave running that really shows off the Genesis's power for adrenaline pumping speed.  Everything about this game is spectacular really.  I can see why when people bring up the best looking Genesis games, Aladdin springs to mind immediately.  It deserves the acclaim it's gotten over the years.  Best platformer on the Genesis as far as I'm concerned.
Playability- Easy to pick up,and as soon as you do you'll be a pro

1347	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a top classic Mario game. I would highly recommend getting it if you love the Mario series! Very good game!
6689	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When I wasn't playing Mario Bros 1985 I was playing this game on the original game boy. In some ways the difficulty of this game rivaled the NES version. I was 4 years old when Super Mario Land was introduced to me and I still pick it up every now and then on my slowly aging Gameboy Color. It was a definite must have for those long car trips (i.e. 8+ hours traveling across Montana and North Dakota in one day). Lives are fairly easy to come by with a couple per level and then at the bonus rounds at the end of the first 2 levels of each world. You can get up to 3 extra lives per bonus round. It is a short game with only 4 worlds but the length of each level helps to make up for the shortness. It has the basic power-ups: mushroom, star, fire flower (super ball instead of fireball in this version). The time limit is long enough for you to explore each level for any potential secrets but not too long that it won't challenge you to hurry to the end.
1427	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	So what is Mario's quest this time? Save the Princess "Peach" by defeating the evil Bowser, while collecting 70 stars in only 15 levels (all 15 levels are contained in 1 huge castle). It might not be the best Mario game, but it offers a new 3D world and a whole new realism. It also has new features such as an energy feature, where rather than collecting power-ups like the fire flower, you now collect a gold coin and you get a block of energy back! Now Mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies, he can now throw punches, kicks and slide into enemies, making full use of the 3D plane. The enemies come to life in 3D, such as huge chain chomps, menacing goombas and annoying koopas The graphics could have been better, because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have. The music and sound effects are nice, because Mario now has a voice to be heard. There are however only minimal power-ups, such as Mario's Winged hat, which allows him to fly, and Mario's steel cap, making him invincible.
4810	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Someone gave me this game as a gift and I must say, it is one of few gifts I actually kept and got enjoyment from.  I have been playing this game for a long time now and can play it at anytime because there is always something new to learn and new ways to get rich and rule the RR business.  This game is detailed, graphically pleasing, and requires some gamer skill.  I am sure you can handle it if you are reading this review.
 This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall, period. I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $6, this is a MUST PLAY. It really is one of the best.

I love how the game lets you customize certain things.  Your government isn't limited to despotism, monarchy, democracy, etc...  You get to choose how your government works on many different levels, such as values, economics, etc...  Also, you get to design your own units.  Want a swarm of fighters to intercept enemy aircraft without a huge support cost?  You got it.  Want a few units equipped with nerve gas that you can paradrop into your enemies terrirory just in case things get desperate?  You got that too.  There are so many combinations you can create, it gives the game more depth than most.

8903	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	There are not many games that I can say are perfect, but this is one of them.  This game is mainly an exploration game that has alot of 2d platforming.  There are many things in this game that will make you want to play it more than once, for example finding things you weren't supposed to with wall jump or finding all upgrades or minimal run.  Super Metroid will have you addicted as soon as you start the game.  The main goal in the game is to find the baby Metroid that you captured earlier in the series.  This game is not too long with some assistance it took me 6 and a half hours.  The graphics may not be stunning like todays games but it is still good on a small enough screen.  Super Metroid is a Must have.
There is no game I can reccomend more highly, do yourself a favor and play this game as soon as possible.  10/10
Other times, zombies will trick you into thinking they're dead, only to grab around your ankle when you try walking past them. You really have to make sure you finished them off before heading towards the next part of the police station. Otherwise, they will be back when you return. Or at the very least, make sure you walk around them *completely* when they're laying on the ground, and don't come near them. I won't spoil anything, but using a magnum bullet on a zombie will give you the ultimate satisfaction. I guarantee it!
2412	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I am no fan of star wars, however, this is a really great game that has gotten a bad rap, because it came with N64 systems. First off the graphics cannot be beaten, everything is extremely detailed from the textures to the fact that every part of the pod racers moves and shutters. This game offers more than one dozen pod racers and drivers, each is unique with unique speeds, skills, traction breaks and so on, each pod racer must be earned though by coming in first for the race where the pod racer is featured. Along the way you pick up "cash" from bets that you come in first, second or third, then you use this cash to buy better parts to your pod racer and pit droids to quickly repair your racer. This is a highly imaginative game complete with three major circuits and a special circuit, in terms of the courses themselves I am a fan of racing games and nothing has ever gotten this amazing, jumps that will take your breath away, ice caverns that try to trick you, anti gravity tubes that will let you fly, swamps that will boggle your mind and speeds to boggle your mind too. The difficulty in the races range from circular to near impossible, with eruptions of fire and snipers shooting at you from high above. For Amazon's price, you need to get this game!
Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.

More weapons, more levels, more characters to select from, the list of improvements is too long to list. The only down side is that things do start to slow down if you have a lot of computer opponents and a couple friends all playing at the same time.

Graphics was never the series' strong point, even though the graphics for Wild ARMS 2 were very well done (outside of the battle system mind you!), and Wild ARMS 3 cell-shading was nice (but kinda dull overall).
If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz. Start on Track 2, sit back, and enjoy the only good thing about this game.
Fun?  5* = because of all of the fun.


3505	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Sega Dreamcast is sort of the James Dean of consoles. It had a very exciting launch coupled with great games. It ushered in many advances in the Console scene some that are just coming to light. Many great games where released in it's short life span. Games like Crazy Taxi, Jet Grind Radio, Shenmue, Powerstone 1&2,Phantasy Star Online, Resident Evil Code Veronica, NFL 2k series and a few others. When it launched things where looking good for the Dreamcast and Sega. Gamers where amazed by the graphics and sound, finally we had realistic Sports games. Systems where selling at a brisk place. Sega managed to turnaround some of the naysayers. The Dreamcast had a tough battle even before it launched. Sega's reputation for abandoning their hardware to early took their tolls. Developers and the gaming public where skeptical from the start. Still some 3rd party devolopers took the chance and consumers did as well. After the first year the Sony PS2 loomed on the horizon. Sony overly hyped the PS2 graphics capabilities and promised a gaming experience like no others. Rumors where spread by Sony's marketing department that Sega would abandon its hardware. It encouraged consumers not to buy the Dreamcast but instead wait for the PS2. It was a David and Goliath marketing battle. Add to this the PS2 came with a DVD player(low end no name brand DVD players where around $300). Initially launch PS2 games looked worse than DC games however Sega never really used this to their advantage. Add to this a workaround was found to easily pirate Dreamcast games with no mod chips. The little profit Sega was making from software sales diminished because of this. Disputes and indifference's with Sega America and Sega Japan also contributed to problems. Sega was bleeding money, SOA wanted to continue the fight but SOJ(Sega of Japan) president pulled the plug after a short 18 month period. The innovations Sega tried to usher in the gaming public was just not ready for it at the time. Also the Dreamcast was caught in between generations early on developers didn't utilize the systems full potential. Most games where ports of PS1 and N64 games or games that didn't look much better than PS1 games. Sega relied on Shenmue to rescue the system like Sonic once did for the Genesis. Inevitably Shenmue had a determinable effect Sega pulled its last remaining resources on this game. The initial game cost $47 Million to develop. The game was a game that you either loved or hate. It didn't sell well and in fact put Sega even deeper in the hole. They where many hit games on the DC but they never had that 1 game that made people go out and buy the DC. Meaning there was no game that developed enough of a buzz the DC had its share of great games.  Soul Caliber helped with the initial launch to sell systems. At one point Max Payne was been developed and Halo as well. One can imagine if these games where released it might of helped. Although the developers of Halo deny a Halo build existed for the DC. Hal-Life was supposed to be that killer game unfortunately it was canceled as by then the DC was essentially on it's way out. Although you can find it as it was leaked and the game was essentially 90% completed. I myself think Sega gave up to quick and would of like to see them hang on for another year. But 3rd party support was pulling from the DC scene by the droves. Today like James Dean the Dreamcast is still loved by many loyal fans in fact games are still been released by Indie developers. Most of them don't do it for profit but simply for love and admiration for the Dreamcast. It still is thinking.
Riven (at the time it was released) was the only game where I played the entire night, keeping a scratch pad next to my mouse so I could notate things I'd find (designs, shapes, items, even sounds as the guy at Ebgames said he recommended to). While still difficult in terms of puzzles and solving them, I found it easier to progress the story and move into the different time periods.

I also own a Neo Geo Pocket, and even though it is a better system, it needs two different kinds of batteries, and all the games get old really fast. This system only needs two AA batteries, and they last a good amount of time. The only bad thing about this system is this particular color. I like the color red, and I jumped at the opportunity to get this Berry Red system. But when I brought it places, I kept getting made fun of, because the system actually turned out to be a perfect shade of pink instead. I would definetly buy this system, just not in this color.

Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.
The sound design is also something to take note of, as voice samples come through clear, and a lot of the songs from the movie made a smooth transition to 16-bit, Genesis FM Synth form. Simply put, Toy Story sounds just about as good as it looks and plays.
I love this game!

'Til this day, I still kick myself for not buying it when I had the chance to. The only thing I was able to do was to download this great game to my Wii from the Virtual Console service. All Nintendo fans, especially Metroid fans should check it out. The SNES had a great, great library of games and this one ranks up near the top.
Over all delta force2 is a fantastic realistic shooter with unique characteristics. It's a great compliment to some of the other great games out there. I own rainbow 6 and rouge spear and this makes a nice alternative. Certainly the price is right.

I had been waiting to try this game out, since I heard it was great in almost every category RPG's try to fulfill. After a couple of days of gameplay, I was both blown away and a little disappointed.
Don't Buy if,
One downside I must point out is that the level where you have to protect John Konner is too difficult. There are several robots and planes attacking the pickup truck. However, there is a way I know to beat this level: Only bomb the planes. Don't concentrate on the robots. And bomb them RIGHT AWAY! Having another player help out would be nice, I guess.
So let's see.  The framerate is identical to Medal of Honor, in addition to the controls.  How about the graphics?  Quake II has pretty good, colorful graphics (which is surprising because most Playstation games are dark, not to mention the PC version mostly features dark and ugly hallways and rooms).  The animations from enemies dying isn't exactly the best you've ever seen, but please keep in mind that Quake II is supposed to be a nonstop shooting blood-bath of a game, and of course, compared to the PC version of the same game of COURSE everything on the PC version will look and play a little better.  You're supposed to be amazed that the Playstation can even HANDLE such an excellent game so well with only minor problems.  Extremely minor problems, at that.

My favorite modes to play in are either Mario GP, because I love racing against the computer, or Battle, because you have to be alert and careful not to run into in obstacles like bananas or shells! I really like the "ghost" so you can see whether or not you beat your previous time with that course. My favorite course is Yoshi Valley because in many areas, there are no walls to keep you from falling, so it's a challenge, and I like the big squasher egg! The one thing that drives me crazy is the fact that the computer can manage to get in front of me while racing without me noticing or even knowing how they did it! Other than that, this is a great game with excellent graphics and fun for the whole family!! I hope you enjoyed my review!!

Streamlined menus for NPC interaction in combat a major plus  and the addition of new perks is very nice.

As for games, you have tons to choose from, and no one is left out. Jet Grind Radio, Shemue, Crazy Taxi, Quake III, and I can go on and on.

4794	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I was blown away by how fun and addictive this game was.  All nine members of Wu Tang with their own individual style (taken from shaolin martial arts) and own individual moves, makes this game even more appealing.  Fight your way through 1 on 1 combat all the way to 1 on 4.  The missions you must complete are challenging and fun and you actually have to master each character and his moves in order to complete them.  Huge number of unlockable characters, and pictures make the replay value sky rocket.  I'm a lifetime fan of old school martial arts films, and this is the only game I've seen or played that brings that feel and attitude.  You gotta atleast play it once, and you'll soon be addicted.  One game that must have a sequel or a new addition.
 The GRAPHICS are what to be expected for this game.  I personally saw no problem with the graphics.  Many people complain about the camera angles, but to me the camera angles added more spook to the game.  The Hunters still looked scary as heck with the limited graphics.  Many of the cutscenes are shown within the game engine, but the opening and ending actually have real actors.  Yes the dialouge is cheezy, but what do you expect?

I believe I got to the last boss once but got demolished so gave up and deleted my file.  That was some years ago.  I have the PS2 version too.  Think I had the same issue but actually did better.

9085	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	That isn't hyperbole; Quackshot is one of the best, and most underrated, games ever made. Sega's "Better than Duck Tales" Disney sidescroller just doesn't get the attention it deserves. But make no bones about it - out of all the classic Disney games, like Castle of Illusion for Master System, Magical Quest for SNES or Ducktales for NES, Quackshot thrashes them all. Why is it so good? Well besides production values - the sprite art and music is really well done and quite charming - the design of the game is really, really strong. This is the closest thing to a "Metroid-vania" style Disney sidescroller anyone developed in the 16 bit days. Donald will find a bunch of gadgets as you go through the levels, from a plunger gun (whose plungers has the great game mechanic of sticking to walls, which creates platforms for you to jump on), to a bubble gun, a popcorn gun and some other stuff. All of them react differently to different environmental hazards and enemies. Some enemies are only hurt by the bubble gun. Some blocks only disappear if you shoot them with popcorn. Which means you'll end up returning to levels once you acquire new goods, blasting past a barrier that stopped your progress before, and finding all new sections to play through and explore. Just like in Super Metroid or Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Although the world here isn't connected like in those games. This game has individual levels connected by a world map. I guess it's more like Demon's Crest then - which is another fantastic, underrated game! When I was six, that was radical, mind-blowing stuff. Now that I've replayed it 15-20 years later, it's still really cool... it's just easier for me to wrap my brain around it now ;) The bosses are really fun and inventive as well; icing on the cake.
985	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	No doubt, the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day.  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it's systems.  It has the best multi player game ever for any system, and a A- single player game.  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons.  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid (the original).  It's game has lots of levels, and is very challenging, but in a good way.  It's cheat options are really hard to get, but once you do, it makes the game even more awsome.  So overall, you only need one word to describe this game: spectacular.
A lot of the game takes place in Sigil (aka: The City of Doors, and the Cage) a circular city on the top of an infinetly tall spire at the direct center of the multiverse.  Sigil contains portals to everywhere in the multiverse...so its a pretty imortant place.  It is run by a mysterious woman known as the Lady of Pain.  She is very tall, floats above the ground, and is enshrouded by blades.  You do not want to meat her.  If you make her mad or even worship her, she'll either maze or kill you.

977	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Turok 2 when I was younger as a kid was amazing, no parents told me I was not aloud to play it because they never actually played it themselves to know. The graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes. The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once. Plus I didn't have a controller pak. Then came the day I bought it again for my n64, nothing looks more sexy than Turok 2 in a green nintendo 64. The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels. Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing. I was always able to hold as many as they would let me. Such as doom, Turok, South park, Armorines, perfect dark, etc. Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps. Sure they have better graphics and frame rate. But they are all the same to be honest. Emulators sucks ass I don't care if its rgb or not. But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps's are all I got. But something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much. To me it's the best looking system and has the best looking games. Turok tops it all! Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of. Turok 2 is on pc and n64. The n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate. Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out. In my honest opinion I wouldn't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all. Still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it. The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is. They are smart and fight one another (really fun to watch) I found the game to run best in Hi-res-LB and looks the best as well. The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different. My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow, Shotgun, War-blade, Razor-wind, Cerebral bore, Plasma Rifle, Mag-60, Grenade launcher, the kick ass Charge Rifle (ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS), Firestorm Cannon (like a mini-gun but different and bad ass sounding), Nuke, Flamethrower (The first fire to actually show 3D even in almost all games on n64), and the torpedo Launcher (because you can go through water faster). Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game I have ever heard, sorry Perfect Dark your music and K7-Avenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass. Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that, that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound. The multiplayer in Turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning (I run that in low-res) and is just as good as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, The world is not enough, and Turok Rage wars. Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well. Armorines (a amazing game! Uniquely different yet just as awesome), and South Park (not many liked this game but to me it's like a mixture of Doom+Turok=South park!... The multiplayer is good to just don't go above 2 players.) So you see Turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game. Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed. They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so. Making their games unique. Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did. Extreme G2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything. Extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series. I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game (except turok 3, its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap). So Turok 2 is amazing! if you want to try it get it now! on n64 or even on PC! You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels! Turok is the greatest fps try them all! (your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection) Dinosaur Hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game, the first fps on n64. Seeds Of Evil 2 Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play. Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection. Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns. Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer. Turok PC,360,ps3 I played it on 360, Runs on the Unreal Engine (which is bad ass) a great game with good weapons (Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate, I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok 2 but not as good and not as good music, awesome multiplayer [if anyone is on] and a good campaign). These are the Turok games! Which started out as comics and became life and were playable. Get Turok 2 you will enjoy it! And bring a few friends over! It is A True Turok Game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy CoD fans.
Bonus stages are also here. There are two main bonus levels, one being a small, slot machine type game you play to earn extra lives, apples, gems and the like, and the other are stages where you get to play as Abu; Aladdin's pet monkey. The great thing about the Abu stages is that they're based on precise character placement, jumping, sword slashing (yes, even the cute monkey has a sword - awesome!), and collecting various items. These stages work well, in the sense that they enforce how tight the control really is in this game, and the animation on Abu, much like every single character in the game, is seriously astounding. For my money, this is one of the single best animated games of its generation, coming in at a close third to Earthworm Jim 1 & 2.

After much practice I still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats.

7727	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Spider-Man has been in a lot of games in his career, from his first adventure on the Atari to the recent game for the Playstation. Between the two, this Genesis game came out and it didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire. What you're looking at here is a very average game that doesn't do our friend Spidey justice. The gameplay is just too bland and repetitive for it to be fun. While it does have plenty of his best villians, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Graphics are good, sound is okay, but there are better games out there. Sadly, the Playstation Spider-Man game has been the only game to truly capture what Spidey's all about. If you have a Playstation, pick that one up. But for you Genesis owners, you're out of luck.

606	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game.  After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.
Even without the mod this game is slamming!!!.
Aside from those big parts of the game, you can also try to make one of the several girls in the game fall for you. To me, it was always Karen that I went after. How you make them grow fond of you varies for each one. If you take too long, though, you won't have to worry about any of them. You will be all alone. Forever. They will each get married to someone else or run off.

I would recommend that you buy Spider Man or the Spider Man Movie Game instead of this annoying game that never ends.
4093	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	A modern classic, this is an finely-honed first person shooter with a compelling story, some excellent action set-pieces, great presentation, and a ground-breakingly perfect musical score. It reeks of quality, and stinks  of class - the creators obviously cared about making a good game, and that  simple fact sets 'Half-Life' apart from everything else. Now almost two  years old, 'Half-Life' is still just as good as it was, and it could be  released tomorrow and still make the same impact. It's an embarrassment of  riches, with too many good things to count - in amongst the  seemingly-intelligent soldiers, giant tentacles, amusingly jingoistic  security guards and radioactive water the game almost off-handedly solves  the problem of how to tell a story with a computer game - and it's  extremely immersive. You really need to play it with headphones, or an  expensive stereo. Everything from the plausible, gloomy environments, to  the metallic chatter of your machine-pistol, fits the atmosphere perfectly,  and there's a sparse, scary set of musical cues which mix ambient techno  with noisemusic. It's even excellent fun as a multiplayer game, or even in  related 'Team Fortress' form. It's rock-hard, too, but in a way that makes  you want certain bits again and again. All told, it's a classic, and you  should own it already (plus the mission pack).
In all, Vandal Hearts is a great game that should be played by everyone who likes turned-based strategy. Even though it's not as good as Final Fantasy Tactics, It's still tons of fun to play. Highly Recommended.
I would recommend this game to any RPG player, or anyone who has access to a compatible system and hasn't played it before.

6559	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Great game, now I have Final Fantasy I, II, V-X. i just need III and IV. But this game itself with V and VI on separate discs is quite the adventure, I haven't gotten too deep into it, but it seems any avid FF fan will love to add this to their collection.
2273	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I must admit, I was a tad dissapointed that we had to buy this thing in order to play some games for the N64.  Not that many require it, but the  best games DO require it to get the best performance out of it.  As the  days of Nintendo went by, so did the games and so did my endless day in the  house and not leaving it, to play with my N64.  I've come to the  realization that the PAK does help out much with many games that don't even  require it.  A fact that you might not know about the expansion pak is that  it does, in fact, help every N64 game out there, however, not all of them  take in the dramatic effect that it has to offer.  Games not designed for  it, won't use it as much or as well as games that do work with it will,  however, little things can be improved.  As with the N64 Expansion Pak,  I've noticed that many games (designed for it) work more than well on the  system and are greatly improved.  As the fact that Nintendo is pushing out  games that now require it (Majora's Mask, DK64)it is vital to have it.  A  tad pricey, yes, but beneficial all the same.
The gameplay is purely genuiss and bullet time aspect of slow motion is awsome.  Really there are no bad points i can think of, just don't let the kids play this one.

I love what Eidos has done with the role-playing game and first-person shooter.  The idea of making a "first-person sneaker" is a reality.  This game hits it right on the mark.  Your character is weak in head-to-head combat.  It is hard to beat just one guard with your sword, and if he summons his friends with a cry for help, then you are dead in the water.  In "Thief", you must rely upon your wits, stealth, dexterity, and cunning to sneak past or ambush whatever beings stand between you and your loot-to-be.
6868	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	came fast great game and good fun to play something that will always be time less and n64 is epic
 Overall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a ps2.
Those are the only games you need on N64 that are worth it
overall this is a great game and a must in every n64 game librarie

Cons:
I got these to use in a project, so they are mostly disassembled now. Still work great for what I'm doing!

7754	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	like it.
Despite these complaints, there is a lot to like. Destroying buildings and collecting rdu's is a lot of fun. It's a satisfying feeling when you see your bulldozer driving through structures as though they were roadkill. The ability to destroy buildings and the patience required is what makes this very fun and rewarding. It's also very rewarding to finally complete those very difficult levels - especially if you do it in the nick of time. Receiving a gold medal on the toughest of levels is a great feeling. Too bad the game is short-lived. It may last you any where between 10 and 15 hours, but just when you think it's over, it's not. A lot of levels take place on other planets and after you get all gold metals, it's time to head to the time trials.
2810	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I just purchase this game a few weeks ago. It was the first that I played anything related to Myst. This is is user friendly, unlike other games where you have to fumble over the keyboard controls.

859	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was my second visit with Zelda after the original NES game. Wow. This game was SO ahead of its time in graphics, gameplay, story, everything. Seriously ground breaking stuff for when this game was released. I've played this game off and on for most of my life, first getting it around the time it was released.
This real time strategy games has three races that though diverse are well balanced. Blizzard made sure the game was challenging and fast paced. Whether playing the single player campaign game or against live players you will have to pay attention or be over whelmed. It is a game you will not want to stop playing. Highly recommended.
Graphics: Working Designs kept to the sprites and kept it looking a 32 bit rpg. They did do something to keep the story moving along with anime clips, wonderfully done by the way, which they used to introduce characters and to help the storytelling.
949	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the most fun multiplayer games you can play on the Nintendo 64.  The single player portion of the game is enjoyable too but the real fun is in the multiplayer and racing and battling your friends.  My friends and I logged countless hours with this game.  The only negative I have is the AI cheats something awful in the single player portion but aside from that it's a great game in every sense and a true classic.
8104	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I made a big mistake when I first reviewed Duke Nukem: Time to Kill and gave the game 4 stars.  It turns out that, as the game goes along, you're required to climb, swim and basically luck out avoiding gunshots from enemies.  Enemies will ALWAYS hit you at least once before you can hit them.  Not fair.  The game is too hard, and the play control makes me absolutely sick.  For some reason, you have to hit the Up button if you want to swim down.  Makes NO sense at all.

9367	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Great, thank you!
6705	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	This game is the worst fighting game ever. You have to press start to change from punch to kick, the players are original, but just damn dumb, and the game is hard. You will be lucky enough to even pass the first person. The graphics are ok, but it's horrendous mechanics destroys any hope for this game, and you can't even change your character if you loose, so that forces you to hit the reset button every time you want to change characters.
It's like Starcraft with bad graphics, zilch instructions and awful controls.  There are better games out there that are free!
The story is simply and still pretty satisfying. Evil Ganon is trying to escape from his sealed imprisonment, and you have to stop him. A some point you are able to go into the dark world, sort of a parallel universe version your normal world. This doubles the size of the game and really enhances the gameplay and exploring. Just wonderful. Good game length, about the size of a modern game.
In conclusion, Dark  Reign 2 could've been a classic. It's the only game I've bought in the past  two years that can be played straight-out-of-the-box, which even Diablo 2  can't lay claim to. And it has an excellent graphics engine. But it's the  pathfinding AI and the too-brief single player game that really lets it  down. Dark Reign 2 is, unfortunately, no Starcraft. But that shouldn't stop  PC gamers from giving this one a fair go.
563	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Where to begin with this train wreck of a game.  Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better.
9632	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	With a long list a horrible First Person Action games including the never to be released Dikatana, the sad Kingpin, and the horrific Blood II, it's a pleasure to see a really find, hardcore, and all together viciously  wonderful first person shootem up game come across my computer screen.
There are many fun levels in this game including the train level, car level, and many other levels. Me and my friends love this game! If you like games like all tomb raider games, duke nukem, die hard, and tomorrow never dies you'll love this game!
The only real way to interact with Pac-Man to make sure he does what you want him to do is to shoot at stuff in the environment. You can make him eat foods like apples and hot dogs, you'll have to shoot at things to get them to drop from trees or to keep things from hitting Pac-Man, you'll need to shoot doors of stores (surprisingly the glass on the doors doesn't break) to make Pac-Man go in, and what's more, you'll have to shoot Super Pac-Balls at him to make him turn into Super Pac-Man so that he'll attack the ghosts when they appear.
This game is still amazing.  The play control is amazingly smooth, and you can make mario do some unbelievable things.  The worlds are amazing.  You can go wherever you want to go, do whatever you want to do.
Along with some new characters (Maya, Kim Wu, Tusk and end boss Gargos) and returning characters Jago, Orchid, TJ Combo, Fulgore, Saberwolf, Glacius and Spinal, you're sure to find some completely hardcore fights and of course, new combos, new moves and newly added supermoves. Also, no longer are fatalities done while your opponent is dying, now they are done during combos (Ultimate Combos). It's a great, new and challenging system.
4607	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	One of the best FPS for PS One.  Great graphics with a surround sound option.  Comtrols leave a bit to be desired as far as customization goes.  Not much for scares or surprizes and still mildly inferior to the legendary original.

The only major problem is that special ability system they designed for this installment of Final Fantasy tends to encourage an awful lot of wandering around killing huge numbers of enemies, so there are larger blocks of time than I'd prefer which are devoted to mindless battles rather than the plot itself.  This seems to be a style that SquareSoft has moved away from in later games in the series.
The sound is quite good, with lively and catchy music, fairly good voice acting, and lots of boops, bumps and squeaks
Dragon folklore is derived from 2 backgrounds: European and Chinese. Stories of these mythical beasts have been passed down for generations, with each culture passing down different stories about these flying animals. The 2 cultures have intertwined in recent years, due to more contacts throughout the world. Although it is difficult to pinpoint exact origins for these creatures, they have still remained popular through various mass media, such as books and films.  This game, however, is not the average dragon story.


Overall: probably  one of the better games that money can buy right now.  Numerous games that  have come out since do not measure up.  It has a very nice feel, and is  very polished.  A good purchase you won't regret.
2907	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	As a long childhood fan of this game.. It was the first PS game that had completely mesmerized me.. Rich, breathtaking scenery that blends well with the brilliant underscore.. Fleshed out characters and a story that could stand the test of time.. I hope to introduce it to my children one day and they pass it on to their children's children.. Till the day I die, this will remain my favorite game of all time.. And will go down in history as one of the classics.. Nothing like it being made today.. 100% on this one.
1996	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Even a decade down the line, this is a great game. The original Star Fox on SNES used a ground-breaking chip to create rudimentary 3D graphics. The N64 version took that and essentially upgraded it, giving the graphics an overhaul and tossing in a few new gameplay enhancements. This was one of the first games on the N64 to feature large amounts of speech, and also the first to use the rumble pak.

2866	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	If you are a huge fan of the Doom games, then you will love this. Its Doom, with more of a humorous side.
9075	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I race dirt bikes and really enjoy dirt bike simulation games, but until Excitebike 64 came out I was left unsatisfied.  I bought this game and pretty much continuously played it until I finished it, which was no easy task.  The controls are easy to master after a little while, but the different difficulties of the track and computer races keeps the game challenging.  Has a great diversity of different race modes, including edit your own track, soccer, and hill climb.  The game even has a training mode to get the driver used to the controls.  I highly recommend this game to anyone.
What fun.

7023	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Rare was known for making some excellent games for the N64; Goldeneye 007, Banjo Kazooie and Tooie, DK64, Blast Corps, Diddy Kong Racing, the list goes on. And among all others, Conker's Bad Fur Day reigns supreme. However, Perfect Dark is probably their least mentioned work on the system. Its an amazing first person shooter off the Goldeneye engine, it runs smoothly, looks amazing, and plays wonderfully. If you're not willing to pay the exorbitant prices for GoldenEye, Perfect Dark is the best solution
5956	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	You don't have to do a lot of thinking or puzzle solving in this game and sometimes I just like to kill things so this is great!  The graphics are pretty cool and if you get upgrades the get better.  I love the fact that you can be one of five characters now instead of just one of three -- the male characters still outweigh the female.  There are some graphic glitches every now and then which make your assistants pace back and forth and not rush to your aid.  The graphics can get a bit gross especially in act IV where you go to "hell".

1055	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Mario Kart 64, the sequel to the first Mario Kart game on the SNES is great. Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun, but added a lot too. The gameplay is much more enhanced, the characters look much better and the individual go-karts are very realistic.

3242	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love this innovative game. The combat system is so fun. Picking up objects and throwing them at your oponents will give you significant advantage over them. The transformation after you collect all three power stones is so cool! I like the fact that everyone gets a chance to evolve and to become the strongest fighter.
Although Nintendo stopped making games for the Nintendo 64, Mario Golf is only one of the very few sports games I highly recommend for the system. Although many people might not see the review, because of the newer game system reviews and newer games of the Gamecube, Xbox, and Playstation 2.
can go in 1st person veiw

  This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in. The size of a typical game back then, but with the technical advancements of some of the games today. The graphics are very good, as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly. The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time.  The sound is entertaining for a while, and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses, showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts.
7277	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Well this is a change of pace, starting the week witha good game for once and not utter s***. This was actually the first F-zero game I was ever exposed to when i was little. I never was never really into racing games outside of Mario Kart when I was younger, most of the oens on the snes were all kinds of bad or went to ahrdcore into the realism for my tastes. I preferred crazy, off the wall racers. This, Mario Kart and episode 1 racer were the only racing games I owned for the n64, I know that limits my tastes a bit, but no reviewer is without bias (Also I was poor back then and not even out of HS yet).

2043	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Do you remember sitting behind the steering wheel at the arcade and playing this game? I know I do! Brings back a lot of memories!
If you're reading this I assume you know the basics (this is an RPG, the first 3D Final Fantasy, et cetera). I'm also going to take for granted that you realize that is game is over a decade old, and as such it's a liitle unfair to compare it to today's games (though it has aged remarkably well).

2998	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	It wasn't until the Greatest Hits version came out that I ever really took an interest in Final Fantasy VII. I guess it was because I wanted to pursue the game in my own time. Besides, back when this game first came out, you hardly ever found a copy on the shelf to buy. I was always one of the unlucky ones, it seemed. Finally, after obtaining a copy for myself, I got to see what all the 'hoopla' was about.
Ocarina of Time remains my favorite game of all time, even before some of my new favorites and there's nothing like turning on that N64 and playing over and over again. I never tire of this game. It is a true classic.

Don't expect a masterpiece of Sequelhood, but do expect  a fun strategy gaming experience that will last quite a while!

4510	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	It seems some people don't like Call to Power because it's not Sid Meir's Civilzation, but that's exactly the point: It's a different game. This game is kind of a hybrid between Sid Meir's Civilization and Age of Kings. I think the AI intelligence is right up there with Civilization by Sid Meir. Also, the graphics are pretty good too. (This game is "old", so it may not be up to some people's standards.) Also, I like the huge maps and the lots of advances, city improvements, and units. Quite frankly, I like Call to Power's space-age military units better than Civilization's. If you're looking for a Sid Meir clone, don't buy this. But if you're looking for a fun alternative, this could be for you.
3912	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I loved this game it was really fast come to us.
- Too many moves are wrong, not done right, given to the wrong wrestler ect and high flyers like Rey Mysterio don't have off the rope moves or anything, there basically grounded. or moves are missing, hogans leg drop is not a finisher, Nash doesnt do that size up thing in the corner, scott hall has no choke slam, lex luger has no torture rack, sting does headscissors, but its the wrong headscissors, he does a cruiserweight one instead of the regular one, randy savage doesnt raise his arms on the top rope elbow, god knows what else is missing.
New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.
743	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Arrived on time, works great , my daughter loves it.

The game begins slow and is a little confusing at first.  You are moved from location to location and given a lot of story (the story in Tactics is the deepest of any bearing the name Final Fantasy).  You must fight by moving your characters around the field of battle and placing them so that they can do the most damage while hopefully avoiding getting too injured.  Terrain is important. This game features a very well done job class system, so what job class your characters are affects what they can do.  Only a chemist can use healing items, only a mage can cast magic, Knights are very strong and can wear armor, and so on.  Mastering the job classes and learning what the best way to fight battles is very important and will determine how successful you will be.  It seems a little daunting at first, but putting the time and effort into this game is worth it.  It is often overlooked, but it is one of the best on the Playstation.  For RPG fans, Final Fantasy fans, strategy fans, or just someone looking for a great game and a new experience: Final Fantasy Tactics is the game to get.
9454	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I had this a long time ago and now that i have a Nintendo 64 again i have been restocking all of my old games, this a classic right on par with ocarina of time and other major  games! this is a must have for anyone who is a fan of the older nintendo consoles!
I've played it the second year after it came out, stopped, and went back. Clan leader of 4 clans and second rated general to the leader of 12 clans, so I'm pretty sure I know this game quite a bit. Oh yeah, I would say the rating is 4.5 not 5 as there are flaws even though insignificant.

Bottom line, amazing game for any Michael Jackson fan or SEGA Genesis fans.
4305	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	PROS:
If you own this game, there's an easy cure. Either melt it in a fire or throw it in the sea or anything that makes it dissapear from existance, please don't sell this game to anyone. It's an insult that this game was even made.
In blitz you can make your own plays even choosing if you want the player to fake at the time spin or even go faster. But the plays aren't always as successful as they seem when you make them.


7967	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	A fitting end to the Donkey Kong SNES era. Was never a huge fan of Dixie or Kiddie Kong but this IS a Donkey Kong Country game so you know it's going to be awesome.
4644	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	At the time when the Neo Geo Pocket Color was released, I, like many others, didn't buy it because I wanted a Game Boy Color. SNK, although extremely successful in Japan, was not able to match the popularity of Nintendo's well-marketed new handheld console in America. Sadly, SNK USA eventually went under and the Neo Geo Pocket Color disappeared from shelves.
First off, the graphics are quite nice, with four different worlds filled with tracks that up the ante on every other racing game out there. Imagine double loops, steep drops, sudden turns, lava, driving on the ceiling, and corkscrews that make the whole screen spin. Speed-wise, Extreme-G is second to none. Unfortunately there is that dreaded layer of fog (a different color for each world) to hide pop-up and keep things moving at high speeds. While it doesn't disturb the gameplay (the fog is not as close as in Turok), it comes at the expense of any sky texture or backdrop that could have lent the tracks more personality and made the loops and twists more dizzying. Another problem is the frame rate. XG often moves so quickly, the N64 is having a hard time to keep up a consistent frame rate. But in the end, XG's incredible sense of speed, the excellent track layouts, and some very cool roadside graphics and lighting effects quickly make you forget these cosmetic shortcomings.
2443	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the best battle games ever made.( in my opinion) My friends and I used to play this all the time when we were younger and we were having a party and thought it would be a lot of fun to play again. The only problem was none of us could find our copy so I got a new one.
There are a few mini-games and side-quests too. Trying to find all the heart containers is a challenging (and fun) task. There are a couple of weopons which are not essential to finish the quest, which is good. You can find them for the fun of it. Plus, you have two (almost identical) worlds to explore.
A must have to keep the 20 year old systems working.
7880	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I've played this game for a long time, and it's one of the best shooter games. It may not have an obvious story, but it's still fun. The graphics aren't bad, the characters and creatures look great. The levels get harder as you progress through the game, but it's not impossible. The weapons are really cool, especially the ones that you find later in the game.

The really astonishing thing about this game is the game-play design, level design and balancing and yes, to a large extent this is because of the AD&D system that powers the game's concepts.

  Missions very unforgiving
4336	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	looks like re-made software and the joystick won't work properly. Sucks.
Rare has a history of making tough games and Diddy Kong Racing follows this tradition. There's so much to do and look at and for the dedicated gamer, this game delivers. But for those who don't have a lot of time to invest or are easily frustrated by an intense learning curve this game brings, you may not want to play it. With its great graphics, main story mode with lots to do and a decent multi-player mode for you and 3 other players, Diddy Kong Racing is a good effort from Rare. Whether or not this is a better game compared to Mario Kart 64 depends on who you ask. Give it a try if you can get this for a low price. As an alternative, you can pick this up for the Nintendo DS but it went through some changes as a result of Rare porting it over.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm a casual Nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the Super Nintendo and Nintendo games on newer consoles, Super Mario World isn't one of them because it's frustrating and it sucks.
If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

2. I haven't played many Full Motion Video (FMV) games, but I thought this one was very well done. The acting is as good as that on any Star Trek episode; the Borg are horrifying and menacing; and Q is in magnificent form, as usual. It was great fun to have Q chastise and insult you in the same sarcastic way he uses with Picard or Janeway.
Strategy becomes  an enormous factor in playing this game, purely because your objectives  will often require teamwork.  The game has made this easy by providing you  with the ability to individually change each of your robotic teammates' AI.  Better yet: play with your friends via the internet (NOTE: internet play  is extremely laggy, so i wouldnt recommend even trying it without a  broadband connection of some kind).
Opposing Force is built on the same quake2 half-life engine, Almost everything from the main menu is the same as half life, There are many new weapons but not any cool weapon like the crossbow, Even the crowbar is not here. The Grenade is looks much smaller here, Maybe Gorden freeman has small hands or maybe Adrian has large hands. Many new monstors but none like Gronarch. Many new charecters but i did not like the new security gaurd, The one who opens the door to let Shephard out in the first level. Compared to HL the game is quite short and linear, The load times are quite longer and the story is quite unbelivable and some sences are very silly. The puzzles are good but most of them are inspired from the orginal game, In one level you need to kill a monstor the same way you kill the tentecles In the HL level "Blast Pit". I did not like all the silly jokes too (No aliens were harmed during the creation of this game), Gearbox this is supposed to be an expansion pack for half life not Quake. Just like thief you need to climb ropes too, But climbing and swinging ropes is quite badly done and not as easy as thief. Opposing Force is not an awful game, It is a very good game and a must for half life fans, But it lacks the great story, superb gameplay, great puzzles, level design, superb action and orginality that made half life so great. It does not live up to the expectations it created as the half life expansion pack.
889	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is fantastic. Personally, I love it. Have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named Tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch? Also, have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces, musical notes, dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named Jinjos? Also, have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms? Well, if you haven't, this is where to start. This game is perfect for all ages.

Overall, even though there are minor setbacks which keep it from being perfect, X4 is still by far one of the best in the series. It's very easy to find and a great way for newbees to get into the X series. The next two games turned out to be a mixed bag of sorts (X5 was made for beginners, and X6 for hardcore fans. Go figure). So what are you waiting for? Get equipped with bubble lead and go buy this game right now!

8745	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I first played this great game over 10 years ago at a friends house, and fell in love-I actually like this better than the Mario series. I recently found a Genesis system by sheer dumb luck, and along with it Sonic 1 and 2. I popped it in and was re-united with a long, lost friend. And the music! That is one of the reasons I got the game! The graphics are "outdated"-so what? The gameplay on this blows away many of today's games. We are all bombarded with life-like games today, but this classic and others like it are what set the stage for the current wave. Right now, a lot of people are out getting the newest games, I am going against the grain and playing the classics. While I intend to get a "next gen" system soon, I refuse to put these old games out to pasture. Sonic will live forever!

The game is one big and bad puzzle floor where crushing cubes come falling your way and you need to avoid them by making use of explosives you place in the floor. The more cubes you destroy, the more points you get, and as you advance further the speed the cubes come your way increases by dangerous margins.

We're approaching the target now, and beginning our bomb run. Out of the blue and shouted over my headphones, tail gunner says 'Bandits!, Six o'clock high, coming in now! Looks like 109's'. I'm firing now, remember - lead them, fire just ahead, let them fly into the stream... I'm missing!, God what a time to realise I should have put in more practise. From the waist position I see a black puff with an evil orange eye, burst under the port wing of the 'fort' flying next to us. 'There goes another 17' over the intercom as it slowly sinks out of formation, smoke spewing from two engines. Shrapnel has punched holes in our wing, metal frame is showing. More serious is the injury to the turret gunner. 'Navigator get back there and see what you can do'. The bombardier calls out ' 'Bomb doors open'...time seems to stand still, finally...'Bombs away', the shudder and sudden lift confirm it. 'Head for home.' Starboard outer engine now sputtering, any flames? No, smoking slightly though. No need to feather engine. How long to go? how many injured? how bad? Did I mention this game was immersive!!!?
7974	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	In June 1995, two of my dad's work friends took me out to dinner.  We had Little Caesars pizza.  That wasn't the only cool thing to happen that night.  I also was allowed to pick out a present.  Nothing too expensive, just a little something to keep me entertained.  We walked to a video store that was ready to go out of business.  They had some WWF wrestling videos (back then it was called WWF, not WWE like today), and I was about to buy a video because the prices were cheap and I was a big wrestling fan at the time.  But then I noticed a nearly-empty shelf to the left of the wrestling tapes where The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past was sitting.
Planescape Torment had this and much more.
In one sentence: A more challenging version of Mario Kart that includes hover boats and planes.
  Another reason is the fantastic gameplay. The stealth is something innovative and welcome. You really shouldn't shoot everyone(no matter how tempting)because they will call for back-up and most likely kill you. Weapons are fun to use and items help make it easier to go along.
Basically, for Sonic 3, the thing that was improved the most over Sonic 2 was special features (and graphics). Not only did they add a verses round, but they added more options such as time track (try to beat your best time w/ separate characters!). Also, the saving mode allows you to save where you left off from, and also saves all your lives and continues. Once you've completed the game, you can go back and play any level you wish on your saved game. You may delete any saved game that you want at any time, and you can even play no save! Tails can fly, which is an awesome feature. And, another added bonus is the addition of shields to the game. In Sonic 2, the only shield that existed was the protection shield, good for one hit so Sonic could be spared his rings (or a life). However, with Sonic 3, three new shields replace the old protection shield. The flame shield protects Sonic from any flame or fire-induced harm (even lava!), the water shield protects Sonic from drowning, and is VERY useful in Hydrocity (and other levels, since Sonic 3 has a LOT of water), and the lightning shield, which protects Sonic from a lot of electric hazards and also attracts rings by magnet. Sonic can do specialized moves with the shields, but even when lacking a shield, Sonic can do an insta-shield, which is useful when a hazard is near. Tails can also use the shields, but he cannot do specialized moves with them.
This is absolutely the best first-person shooter series on the N64.

SOUND:
A quick note on some of the earlier reviews.  The overall rating of this game has been lowered because it made the mistake of being released too early in order to capture the holiday shoppers.  Three patches have since been released and cleared up most of the technical issues involved.  I haven't had any crashing problems as of late.  This is a game I delved into not expecting to enjoy but was utterly surprised.  A keeper for anyone that would like to spend their free time with an entertaining PC game.

The graphics and sound effects are of course dated but for their time period they're very well done and despite their age I actually found that I enjoyed the look and feel of it all. The strategic map is vast and diverse, and while the tactical arenas are more or less cut and paste I never felt like I was fighting on the exact same battlefield against the exact same opponent.
From it's highly interesting beginning at the start of the colonization of a totally Alien world, you can take your choice of factions to total Transcendence - going beyond humanity and almost becoming a god.  There are more different ways to play this game then there is space to review it.  Do you want to try you luck as the Scientist and research your way to the top?  Or do you want to have Peace with the Peacekeepers?  Or do you want to conquer the world with a religious fervor?  These are just a couple of the great factions available during game play.


461	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.
1725	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer, Naughty Dog had a great idea, and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay, the graphics, the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds, such as: "Oombadegha!". You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!
 The game is more a phsycological thriller and that's one thing resident evil never real had. RE brought the gore and zombies. You know what you were fighting and that it was man made (I.E. a virus). In Silent Hill it's all supernatural and occult related. Even to this day 11 years later this game still haunts me when I think about how scary it was.

6419	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I'm revising my original review where I originally gave this game 3 stars. After reading more about strategy and tactics I discovered that this game is much more fun than I gave it credit for. I realized that my own shortcomings were to blame and not the game. An excellent and fun addictive game that I recommend. This was my original review:

I think he might be a cannibal (or vampire) too, because he eats hearts to gain health. There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it's time to feed.
The Game Boy Pocket is small. It's very small. Yet, this does not detract from the functionality. Another plus is that this system has a CONTRAST SLIDER -- unlike the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, you can alter the brightness or darkness of the screen -- perfect for when you're trying to see something that's just too bright to see (fans of the Pokemon series will remember the Fuchsia City Gym's infamous invisible walls, for example). The contrast slider and its black and white (not green and white like that of the Game Boy) screen alone warranted a buy for me back in the day.
I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.
The plot is remarkably rich. Within the main story arc are many smaller stories that build the players understanding of the nature of each of the characters. There seem to be an unending number of weapons, powers, and monsters. More than enough material for many replays. The graphics are a bit primitive for our time, but were startling when this game first came out. As your imagination adapts to the imagery, the game becomes truly engaging on many levels. Final Fantasy VII is still one of the best of its genre, Whether you are a student of gaming or an aficionado, it belongs on your shelf.

But with no multiplayer support for the original I simply had to await the next installment. And then in 1996 it came. I love this game. I love this game, this constant source of irritation, glory, happiness, grief, anger, sorrow, and consternation all in one. Starting out as one of several races, each with it's own unique characteristics (Humans are good at diplomacy, Psilons are good at research, etc.), you start one one small planet in an huge universe, research your way to building better, and fully customizable ships, to both explore and conquer the other races. Along the way you'll meet the other races and either ally with them or oppose them. And when one crosses you by dropping bio bombs on your planet, rendering it almost uninhabitable, you'll seek the nothing short of the very destruction of thier race. I will make the Alkari bird beaks pay for thier insolence...with thier very existence! *Sigh*...it gets to you after a while, but you'll just have to trust me when I say that it is a very *good* addiction that you won't regret!
-Super Mario with a well written story was a awesome change of pace.
The are a number of hitches, unfortunately. The manual and tutorial are really inadequate--which tends to sting given that most of the fan-supplied data on the Web is gone. The supply-and-demand process is actually somewhat opaque. (I did figure it out, but it took me a while and some research on the 'net.) Your board of directors is very gullible, not able to look ahead even a month (this makes them easy to manipulate). The stock market stuff makes it easy to lose with a thriving railroad and doesn't add much to the game that I've experienced.

Same types of cases
You can pick between 6 characters, each with their own special shooting weapon.  It's pretty cool how each weapon has a very distinct look for each character.  One character called Mamma, has a thick-looking laser beam that just smears any enemies that happen to be standing in the way.

Fortunately, a great game still lies within the great storytelling. The Junction system really isn't as annoying as people make it out to be. Equiping guardian forces is a breeze, and the admittedly cumbersome "Draw" system of magic is tamed by the ease in building levels (you only need 1,000 Exp. per level, as opposed to the varying number of required Exp in previous Final Fantasies). And the battles, while sometimes dragging on longer than necessary, are generally enjoyable and interesting.
"Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps "New Super Mario Bros. U" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.

My personal history with "Yoshi's Island" is I first played the first few levels at a lake house with my scuba instructor's grandson in 1999.  In 2002, I bought an SNES cart second hand on eBay and again played it briefly.  At that point in my life, I had bought "Super Mario All-stars" and "Yoshi's Island" to play with my college friends, and several of them hated the visual style of "Yoshi's Island" so we really didn't play it very frequently.  Fast forward to 2012, and I began playing through "Yoshi's Island" in earnest.
2. the character movements are a bit jerky, liker they're all descendants of the TinMan.
Overall, nothing industry bending, but a few (8-12) hours worth of moderate fun. Waiting until this game's price comes down, is my recommendation.

It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed.
3196	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Best game on Dreamcast, and my all-time favorite fighting game.  Replay value is excellent, gameplay is just fantastic.
If there is a shortcoming to the game, then it is the combat system itself.  The feedback during combat isn't very good, which sometimes leaves you wondering why one of the characters is taking damage, or why your spell didn't work.  The variety of weapons and especially spells is decent, but nowhere close to the variety offered by other D&D games.  For instance, there are only two fifth level priest spells in the game.  The combat is still fun though, and there isn't an excessive amount of it.

By today's standard's the graphics, gameplay, and weapon options are all pretty dated, but in it's day Alien Trilogy was one of the better FPS games to hit the PS1.  All in all, if you still have your PS1 and dig older FPS games, you should give this one time gem a look.

The original MUMG had a certain charm, but only toddlers will fail to find this one annoying. Also included are both Laura Bow mysteries (about a girl detective in the 1930s), which are fun to play but are convoluted and very frustrating to solve (especially since they are in real time, so while you observe something important in one room, you often miss something else important in another room).

  Descent III also features a new game engine, known as Fusion, that enables  the player to move from the familiar mines of the Post Terran Mining  Corporation out to the planet's surface and surrounding environments. I  guess this is hard to do in this sort of game. Additionally, they have  improved the AI, and it really shows in the way the robots behave, and  there is a significant increase danger to your ship in combat. The robots  are all new and feature more polygons and detailed texture mapping than  every before. Additionally, 3D acceleration is probably the best I have  ever seen in any game. Descent 3 uses more dynamic light effects than any  game I have ever seen. In fact, it is so graphically intensive, it is one  of the reasons why I upgraded my 200 mhz to an Athlon 700. The demo ran  fine on my old system, but when I bought the full version, even when I  turned off all of the special effects, it barely ran. I would recommend at  least PII 300, as does Interplay.
  The story seems very cliche to me.  A young adventurer named Justin wants to find new quests for himself.  He's a troublemaker and later finds himself on the journey of a lifetime.  He meets up with many new people and eventually realizes only he (with the help of his friends) can save the world.  It is not very unique or at all intriguing enough, but many of the small side stories is what makes it interesting.
The other problem is the camera angles when walking around something.  When you walk around to the other side of a large object, for some idiotic reason, the camera does not follow you.  As a result, you are sitting there with your entire screen filled in by this object while you can't see Flik on the other side.  Now, as if that situation is not bad enough, picture yourself having to do a platform jump while your view of Flik is completely blocked by a large rock on the screen, or being hit by an enemy that you can't see because the camera won't move.  Instead of turning with you, you must stop for about 5 seconds after turning to allow the camera to "catch up."  At the same time, the camera has a tendency to turn even while you're just running straight ahead in a single direction, which results in you being completely reversed.  It's completely disorienting, and with the bland, nearly identical levels, you can find yourself lost and irritated very frequently.
If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration. It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult.

Zelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game.

The main story is fun to progress through, and you care about a lot of the characters you meet. The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun, non-frustrating, game play.

And man did Sonic deliver a different experience than Mario.
The new character classes are unique  and interesting. My favorites so far are the amazon, since you can kill the  monster at range before it ever hits you, and the sorceress, because,  well... she has all that cool magic. I'm not so sure about the necromancer,  who runs around with dead things, but the paladin and the barbarian appear  to be great melee combatants.
In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.
From The Capcom Universe:
It's funny that I would review this now, because my computer won't even run a game this old. But, if you have an older PC, and it runs games, you need this.
The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here.

In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..
Overall this is great game to pick up again just to see your favorite FF characters :).  Anybody new to the series I recommend playing this one first or FF 12.
True to form RPG, you start low, have a mysterious occurance and you are on your way. Fun. My favorite characters are Boo and Minsk. There's even guest appearances by favorites from a couple fantasy series as well.

As of many, I bought Doom the first day it came out on Playstation years ago. So too all you Halo players that have no clue what Doom is about, everytime you play Halo keep in mind that if Doom never existed most likely Halo wouldn't exist. The whole Doom series is definately worth owning. The Graphics and sounds are now way out of date but at the time they were amazing. This has some of the most complex levels imaginable, it'll keep you entertained for hours. So many games today are like so many other games. The ones that are special are the ones that stand out. This game took a risk to be different, and now it stands as being one of the best games ever created.

7708	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Lovely seller! Highly recommended! :)
The graphics are great, especially when played on the Super Game Boy. With the Super Game Boy, there's a border around the game that makes it look like it's on a Donkey Kong arcade machine. The graphics also shine during the final boss: Giant DK. He looks very cartoonish, but that is how the game is supposed to be: Cartoony and fun. Exercising, somersaulting Mario vs a huge King Kong-sized DK on top of a big building!
The controller looks a little unusual, but is actually very comfortable to hold. The analog stick is also very responsive, and since it's textured, your fingers won't slip off. There are many accessories for the Dreamcast (like the keyboard, fishing rod, light gun,etc) and many awesome arcade-style games.  Check out gems like Capcom vs SNK, Illbleed, Code Veronica, and many many more.

4396	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have been playing this series for thirteen years now, and have never grown tired of playing.  Even now, I am discovering new aspect of the game.
4183	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Another addicting game. I have been trying to play this game and The Sims at the same time and there just isn't enough time. I played this for 6 hours yesterday (Sunday) and wondered where the time had gone. I had bought Disney's Coaster several years ago and thought this game would be just like it. Wrong! This game is way better. You have several scenarios you play plus you can play and redo real amusement parks. They give you lots a money to start with to build up your park. You control the admission fees, the price for all of the rides, price on the food, and you can even charge people for usin the restrooms. You hire mechanics, people to mow and clean garbage, security guards, and entertainers. You can change the color of every ride and play your choice of music. There a banners that will display any message you type plus you can name any ride or food place. The best thing is you can design your own rollercoasters and water rides though they are expensive (don't build your water ride too big as you typically only have 2 boats and the lines get long and customers get upset). You also do your own landscaping and you can see what every customer in your park is thinking and how each ride is liked. If you choose to, you can watch them ride each of your rides. The only conflict with the game I have seen was what they call "thrill rides". When you go to build these, the excitement level is typically low to moderate so I am not sure why they call those thrill rides. This is a very addicting game and time will get away. I think if you get this game , you will also get addicted and then you will have to go buy the other 2 expansion packs, just like I did.
One thing i almost forgot. The "bad" acting is intentional. It's supposed to resemble a cheesey 50s horror movie...if you don't get that or you don't like that than this game just isn't for you.
And finally, if you have a N64, Mario Kart 64 is one to deeply consider
The game is cool.  Graphics are nice (not the best but better than some).  The music is excellent.  The voice acting is skippy but it works.  The magic system can be difficult to figure out in the beggining and hard to level, but hey ^-^ there are places to level them without cheat codes.  [For water, try standing in the green water at the tower and heal yourself.  It does work, though it does take a few hours for each character--recommending Feena to level 99 water/wind.]
A month later I now own this  fabulous game, and I also play golf too, although my real game needs some  work, Mario Golf doesn't. It's fun, challenging experience that everyone  can enjoy. Bring over your three friends and play all night, it's the best  golf game ever made.

There are a lot of fantastic games that look as good or nearly as good as the PS2 (which I also have).  And to be completely honest, I enjoy the Dreamcast more now because of the wealth of fantastic games it has to offer.  In time, I'm sure the PS2 will catch up and surpass the Dreamcast, but right now the Dreamcast is the machine that offers the most fun for your dollar, by far.
2170	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This one makes the Street Fighter games on Super NES look so lame. It has lots of combos the appointeds move very fast. You can always tag team your partner during the game. When you do your signature move the back ground looks has flashing lights, speaking of background I have to say what amazing 2D graphics. Even though this game says Marvel vs Street Fighter doesn't mean only the super heros fight the Street fighters you can make Spider man fight one of the X-Men. I guset they got the idea to make this game is cause the japanese are have great animes these and the U.S. challenges them.

The leveldesign varies from pretty good (snow-level) to simply amazing (amusementpark-level)
Overall
Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the "bottom" of the device.
P.S.: On the Select You Name menu, press SELECT to make the game easier. And, when you're in a course and die, quickly press START and then press SELECT to exit without losing a life.

The additional music CD isn't great, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the set at all.  If you're one of those that got started on the Final Fantasy series through 7 or 8, be sure to check this set out.  It's top notch.
2545	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I remember getting this particular Game Boy Color Atomic Purple for Christmas from my parents some years back. The difference between a monochrome gameboy, and the gameboy color is quite remarkable. It makes a dull gameboy game, a bright and colorful game. This gameboy was great for playing Pokemon, and that is one of my best memories about this gameboy gaming device.

1081	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Let me put it like this, if I had to destroy every videogame I own except one, this is the one I wouldn't destroy. This is simply the greatest game ever made. I'm not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc.. You have to experience it for yourself. Most helpful thing I can do is tell you how you can get to play this. This game has had dozens of ports. One came on a bonusdisc for Gamecube with "Windwaker" in 2003 and another came in a collectors edition (Master Quest) also for gamecube. If you can't get ahold of one of these, the original for N64, or a ROM you should buy a Wii and download it from the Wii Virtual Console. It will be worth the while.


Game Problems:
3452	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	this game is very fun, plays quickly and offer a lot new features, wish it was longer though but the game is a little more difficult than the previous resident evils but still fun.

Gameplay revolves around stealth.  Although there are guns, it is to your advantage to take out enemies quietly and one at a time - or avoid them altogether.  You can go in guns blazing, strangle each enemy one by one, or hide from enemies all together - that is the beauty of this game.  You are given many tools and gadgets to get the job done, but it is up to you to figure out how to proceed.  Unlike many games today with only one right way to proceed, there are many possible strategies to use to make it through the terrorist base.  There are also plenty of boss fights (which in my opinion are the best part of the game) which are all varied and interesting, as well as challenging.
784	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	One of the games that made n64 so great, had graphics for the time, multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of it's time
This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.

I'm very happy to add these games to my collection and excited to play them for the first time.
2467	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	If you see this game around Immediatly purchase it on the spot. this game can provide hours and hours of multiplayer fun. (1 player is boring but better than playing multiplayer by lonesome) there a alot of unlockable characters that are pretty cool here tehy are: Captain Falcon from F-zero series, Ness from the rare Earthbound series, Jigglypuff from pokemon, Luigi from the Mario Bros. series, And if you have a gameshark there are cool codes the allow you to be the boss of the Smash Bros. titles, (Master Hand) and you could also be Metal Mario with a Gameshark. cool huh? have fun and train. This isn't one of those titles you can just rent and enjoy you gotta own it for it to be fun.

Overall, it's still WM the Arcade, so it's a great game... it's just a shame it's collision, music and AI bring it down a few notches.
Among the new features is your ability to garrison your townspeople in buildings & towers to get them out of harms way.  Instead of being all men (like the first one), this one also includes female townspeople as well as Joan of Arc.  Also new is the ability to create several types of military units at the same time using the same barracks / stable / archery range, etc.  In the old version, you could make several units of one kind, but not several units of different kinds.  A helpful  aspect, to say the least.  Another nice characteristic of the game is that you can actually upgrade scouts to light calvery.  That means that you can have military units on horseback (that don't cost any gold) which are actually semi-decent in combat (not so with AE I).
7941	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	My favorite thing about the Zelda games is they take so darn long to finish.  In this way, playing a good video game is like reading a good book.  It takes a long time, but it's worth it.  This game tells a great story, and it really immerses you into another universe.  You're placed in a different world with different limits, and it's like you live a whole other life in a few months (or days, if you're a hardcore gamer).  You follow Link through trials and tribulations on the quest of a lifetime, and fighting them ugly video game monsters is a nice way to have a bit of fun after a long day.
The action is believable, the training is semi real and the charcaters are interactive. Seeing the ship is very cool as well. The younger people seem to like the color and interactivity of it.
First Kirby game,
Music (score 7/10): The music itself is pretty average for an RPG.  It's decent, but not astoundingly good or anything.  What is of note, though, is the voice acting.  Yes, there is voice acting, which is unusual for a PS1 game.  Not just that, but the voice acting is pretty good.  I've heard better voice acting on more modern games, but for a PS1-era game, it's pretty darn good.  Believe me, I've heard much worse (Grandia comes to mind), so kudos to the developers for hiring some decent voice actors.

I have played every Genesis Sonic game for hours and hours and have been a huge fan of Sonic ever since. I was very excited when I got this game with my Dreamcast.
2034	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is so much fun! This is where it all started this game is one of the best mario parties. There's 6 characters who are arguably to this day still the most popular mario characters. There's 50 minigames and 8 fantastic boards!
I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.

The lengh of the game was great...Not too long but great...

The one big flaw, which prevents this game from getting five stars, is the clunky controls. I pity the person who plays this game without the analog joysticks. Harry is very difficult to move around, thanks to the complicated control system. It takes a while to get used to them, but by that time you will have gotten killed a few times. The monsters come out of nowhere, and you have mere seconds to react. With controls this complicated, battles are really frustrating.
The game is fairly easy to play, once you master the controls.  You'll need certain rooms in place (lair, hatchery, blacksmith, prison, torture chamber, and library) to really get things going, along with a number of choice spells (heal, rally, make gold) that can be researched at the library.  You have limited control of your creatures, beyond being able to drag and drop them.  You can take direct control over a creature with the possession spell and even have a number of creatures follow you.  This puts the game into first-person perspective, which can be fun but not all that useful in later stages of the campaign. But again, the real joy of the game is all of the naughty things that you can do, like torture captured heroes in your custom-built torture chamber, have corpses drug to your graveyard where they might eventually attract a vampire to do your bidding, or summon the god-like Horny Devil to turn the tide of a battle.  A fully fleshed-out dungeon feels almost like a small town under your control, and you can spend hours just admiring and tinkering with your handy work (or trying to keep your minions happy).  And though a somewhat dark game, DK2 has more than its share of humor, from the Vincent Price-like narrator to the casino that gives you a ridiculously funny treat if one of your monsters hits the jackpot.  The game never comes across as cheesy or trivial, but it obviously does not take itself too serious.
SOUND:  FF7 had an incredible soundtrack that enhanced the gameplay and made that game even more memorable.  FF8 is no different.  I truly have to thank Nobuo Uematsu for all the hard work, time, and effort they put into this game's soundtrack.  Even the introduction music is stellar.  At times I would find myself humming some of these tunes in my head.

4586	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I finally got my hands on a copy of this. Its a version from Europe, for some reason the American release date isn't for a month or so. Regardless I'm sure the game will be the same. So let me tell you about it. My first impressions are, holy smokes. This game is going to be a huge hit. I'm not sure where to start. Well for one, the graphics are simply amazing. You can fly a huge variety of planes, be it American or German. But the best plane to fly is the B-17 of course. You can man all 10 positions in the plane, and during a mission can switch back and forth. During attacks you are so busy keeping track of everything the time just flys by. You can man a gun turret, pilot the aircraft or even be the bombadier. And if you are unfortunate enough to get shot down, well, don't fret, just switch planes and continue the mission. You can jump into any plane you want, be it the bomber, or your escorts. There are tons of missions to choose from as well. You can do the standard quick missions, training, longer missions from start to finish and various campaigns, both historic and some created ones. I'm amazed they packed this all onto one cd. This game has been in the making for so long, but it was definetly worth the wait. Anyone who likes WWII flight sims will fall in love with this game. I've only had it for a few days since it came in the mail. If you can't wait, get it from a Euro dealer, otherwise, it shouldn't be much longer till North American audiences enjoy this.

3581	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	9/9/99. The day the video game world was changed forever. Sega launched its Sega Dreamcast which had graphics far superior to anything else availible. It also had internet capability to play games over the net and could also play music CD's. The Dreamcast was very succesful in its first weeks on the market, selling more than 500,000 in its first week.
1835	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Sure the storyline isn't that special.  And the in game jokes are cheesy.  And some parts of the game are not a challenge at all.  But there is something about this game that keeps you coming back for more.  Its not too tough.  But it is enough of a challenge where you will keep playing it just to find everything in the game.

Metal Sonic and Hyper Shadow are one of these guys you will face in the stages after Egg Emperor and Final Fortress.

Resident Evil 2 offers a lot of replay value. There are hidden items and other goodies you may not see during your first run, and I highly recommend trying both possible scenarios (Leon A/Claire B and Claire A/Leon B) for the game before moving onto other games in the series. There are also secret game modes and weapons to unlock in this game.
Gameplay:15/5
Intense final battle against boss
A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.
Even with the solutions, it still might take a little bit to do this. I

It plays similar to the first installment, but boasts better graphics and richer character dialogues (The two things going for it.)

Conclusion:

This game is extremely fun and tells a great story. You can play through 6 times without it ever being the same game.

Crash must go through 25 levels and 6 bosses in this game, but unlike the later games in the series, Crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through 3 islands.
The emphasis is obviously on bone-crushing tackles, but after an hour of play, the only really enjoyable aspect of this is the ability to cheap-shot the offensive players long after the ball is whistled dead.  The field-goal kicking system is particularly vexing, as it was apparently designed by a chimp with ADD, and requires eight espresso-mochacchinos in order to maintain the twitch focus required to accurately split the uprights.

The single player mode out side of the story mode is not as fun as the story mode. For one the AI only have one setting and if you don't stay a step a head of them they will destroy you. This mode is much more fun playing against several humans, via LAN game, than against AI. I haven't tried the on-line multiplayer yet, but from what I've read it's still pretty active.

I want to set the record straight about something.  People writing reviews for this game will probably tell you that Nemesis chases you around from the beginning to the end of the game.  That's not exactly true.  Yes, it's true he will be a problem for you until the very last level but, you should know that Nemesis does NOT follow you around for the entirety of the game- he just appears *sometimes*, messes with you by following you into rooms and whatnot, and then he disappears for a while.  If you haven't played this game yet, some reviewers will have you convinced that Nemesis will be chasing you around ALL the time -nonstop- and this is NOT true.

Yes, and that game is called "Golden Eye 007".

But the best part of the gameplay has to be what has rarely been seen in the US: the dating sim. The lead character Meis can actually take certain girls on dates, where the girls asks Meis questions and, depending upon the answer he selects, her intimacy toward him changes. And this isn't without a reason. A high intimacy level with a girl can let Meis forge stronger weapons with powerful spells, so the dating aspect of the game isn't only interesting, it's necessary. Of course, it's important to raise a girl's imtimacy level, but it's also fun to choose the wrong answers in the dating questions, just to see the girl's reactions. While not a full-fledged dating sim, it's still a lot of fun, and it's a pity this game didn't pave the way for dating sims like "Tokimeki Memorial" and "Sentimental Graffiti" to come to the US.

This is the only fighting game I have EVER truly loved. You can't help but develope a bond with your favorite character. Mine is Sophitia. Beautiful, fluid, precise, deliberate. You just HAVE to see this beauty, in her 3rd outfit, doing her Kata in Exhibition Theatre! (After you've "unlocked" that feature, of course) I finished everything there was to finish in this game, 5 months ago. I STILL play it all the time. I'll actually dump my saves on my VMU, and start all over. There is no way you can go wrong buying this game. None. Like I said, even if you don't like fighting games. You'll be hooked in the short amount of time required to learn the basic moves. My son pleaded with me to give it a try, and I was hooked 15 minutes later.
Of all the functions it has, half of them don't even work.  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games, and at worst, caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark.  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code, and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark's memory with useless information.  Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked, names were screwed up with random characters and letters, and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.
4005	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	If you need team-based with a blend of Unreal Tourney and the Sci-Fi Channel, here's a good title to work on. It's all multiplayer, so there's no single-player mode (besides the training missions). It's a hard game to explain, but I can say this: this game is fun and heck and lets you take any role, whether it be a repairman, heavy defence, or transport pilot. Buy this if your computer isn't so hot. If you do have a good computer with a GeForce2, get Tribes 2; it adds on to the first in almost every way and is a little more fun than this title. But get either one, Tribes is one of Sierra's best titles.

But honestly...I just can't pinpoint anything major against this game, because the game seriously enthralled me from start to finish! The big and robust level design, superb soundtrack, detailed and colorful graphics, movie FMVs...It all makes for one great action-packed Banjo-style collect-a-thon, and I LOVE IT!! I'm so glad I finally pulled this out of my backlog, and I highly recommend Toy Story 2 to any gamer looking for a title of its kind!
This game isn't too bad playing by yourself - I've clocked in close to 30 hours alone, which is how I do most of my gaming. I've played with both of my younger cousins:
Back to the product. The game came within three weeks of my order at the same time as a few other items I had ordered from other sellers. I had ordered a used copy, but it worked perfectly on the first try, I didn't even have to blow on the cartridge or break out the quetips. It also looked great, like it had just come out of the box for the first time.
2892	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Got my copy from Gamer Girls Online. It came in original box. 3 fresh looking disc cover too. Great value an bargain. Some people sell the original copy for 75-100$ for this great deal. Thx again. Been playing it all day since it came in mail this morning.
I'm basing it on the year it came out. The levels,and battle graphics look stunning. With that said, though, the characters suffered and look pretty bland. That's the reason for the 1 point off. Not a major problem at all, though. Especially when you play this one for the gameplay, like all RPG's.
3583	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I guess I'm just a Sega fanboy underneath it all, I've always been loyal to Sega since the days of the Genesis, and I've owned the Sega CD, 32X (I want my money back on that), the Saturn, and the Dreamcast.  Now recently I bought [another brand], and guess what, I still play my Dreamcast more...  What killed the Dreamcast was that it was too ambitious for its own good.  Online play made the system one of a kind...  Now the Dreamcast wasn't a bad system at all.  Like I said, the online play elevated the system to new levels, and the library of games (most of them were exclusive...) the system was trouble free and had one of the best designed controlers on the market.  Shockingly original games...plus the best sports titles on any system made the Dreamcast one of the best systems ever made, and I for one will miss it...
Overall, the plotline of the game really hooked me the first time I played the game,


It's interesting to see how Nintendo has come full circle, evolving to something like the Nintendo 64 and in some ways digressing back to it's origins with games like New Super Mario Bros U, which is much like Super Mario Bros for SNES but with updated graphics and a few more tweaks.
The graphics are moderately good, they are not bad but not real good either.  The sound is good, probably one of the best parts of the game.
Baldur's Gate is genuinely deserving of it's classic status and if the CRPG market rewards us with another game this immaculately entertaining, it will be a day for celebration.
3548	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Dreamcast is by far my favorite. It has very fun games as you'll read in tons of other reviews. None of the newer consoles have met my expectations half as good as the Dreamcast did back in the Christmas of 99'. This is coming from a person who owns 19 consoles including the 360, Wii, Gamecube, PS2, etc. Those consoles have fun games, but coming after the Dreamcast, they are more like novelties to me. If you don't get a Dreamcast, you should at least get the ports of its games such as Sonic Adventure 2, Crazy Taxi, Skies of Arcadia, Shenmue II, House of the Dead 2, and many more. I still buy games for my DC off of here. Most can be found in good condition.

gameplay: once again servicable but nothing revolutionary or even evolutionary. as a matter of fact, i think this game takes a step backwords instead of forwards. 5 had the job system. 2 had the unique leveling system. 6 had not only unique skills per character, but had awesome gameplay sequences such as the opera house, the stategic scens where you control 3 parties to more and block advancing troops, etc etc. what did 7 do? had cool summon animations that got old after the second view and could not be skipped....pass!!!!

But wait a minute? The Gameboy was in color too right? Green is a color. Grey is a color. Black is a color. I was so confused. What is the difference between this color and that color?

2. The more characters you have, the more fun you have in the castle you earn in the game.
There are all sorts of twisted plot items that are clear  indicators of the amount of work the designers put into thinking this  through. You wake up with a note to yourself carved in your own back. You  wander outside and find a note-zombie, with notes stuck to his body. Every  doorway can be a portal to another world, if you find the key. But keys can  be anything - a piece of paper, a certain person, even a song sung in a  certain way.
  Which is not to say Max Payne is a bad game. It does introduce a certain charm with a number of new innovations such as "bullet-time" and the nightmare sequences. Trouble is, about halfway through the adventure a serious feeling of "deja-Woo" sets in with the been-there killed-that repetition.

Sluggy the Unshaven's Fort
While old-school gamers may prefer pre-defined roles for each character, the Materia system is still meritorious on its own, allowing uncomplicated customization of characters and adding great depth to gameplay.  Character development proceeds well, with nearly every battle in the game having purpose (unlike some RPGs where hours are spent "leveling up" to get characters past an obstacle), and the in-game pointers help clarify locations whenever the lush graphics are unclear.  The soundtrack is otherworldly, with several haunting, beautiful songs that are simply unforgettable.

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.  Fun doesn't begin to describe it.

Different Agents
Most pre-1997 console RPGs and adventure games' prevalent themes were along the lines of "power of hope, love and friendship", "absolute power corrupts", "elemental" crystals, mystical jewels, and/or mana seeds are best left alone", with the occasional, "hey, don't trust Christianity." Most of these games took place in medieval storybook lands inhabited by elves, knights, fairies, dragons, princesses, and talking trees, and their stories were usually about a small band of misfits defeating an evil wizard or king so the world could live happily ever after and abolish all wars forever. Then we get to the PlayStation era. Final Fantasy VII might not quite be that generation's "Great Gatsby", but it captures turn-of-the-century Zeitgeist like no previous game could and which few games have been able to surpass.
6315	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I've role-played since the 70s, and have probably played every RP game that's come out since that date, including recent reviews for BellaOnline.com. My first assumption was that Planescape would be a  knock-off of Baldur's Gate, and be fun but not unique.
1. Going to 'instant action' from the main game menu, I am presented with a CTD (Crash To Desktop), which means the game crashes, and your back at your desktop.
  Altogether, I think that this is a game for anyone into the Volkswagen Beetle, racing games, or multiplayer.  It combines the best interests of all elements of the racing game.
Gameplay: It's strange to revisit an old gameplay system since it's familiar enough to know what to do but it's been so long and you've played several different types that it feels...alien, no pun intended. Essentially, controlling Joanna dark's movement and vision is the Analog stick and the C-Up and C-Down, while the other 2 are for strafing or more correct turning. It took some getting used to since I've had to use dual analog for a long time and eventually I got around to it but it still felt odd. Missions are broken up like Goldeneye with several objectives before you can finish the level and in a neat feature, the objective can be different on different difficulty settings. One mission might require you just to do one or 2 things while on Hard, you'll have to do some extra stuff to pass.
Although the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in Janes Attack Squadron so is the level of overhead.


I haven't encountered any blood in the game yet, but, as far as I'm concerned, blood is overrated because the color red is just that- a color.  It means nothing to the actual gameplay.

The voice acting is fantastic. The characters end up being well developed, and like I said before, they make you care about them. The voice actors really made their characters come to life. The unit sounds are also very well done, and are fairly distinct.

I wasn't dissapointed.
The system requirements are unusually high, and even on a powerful system, it is very difficult to run it smoothly.  Still, a great game.
 What makes Final Fantasy VIII unique is that it shows Squaresoft, while still keeping the series at its basic roots, is unafraid to tinker a little with its formula. First of all, the storyline is quite a bit different from earlier Final Fantasies. It centers mostly on character development and keeps the basic good-versus-evil plot (while still an integral part of the game) more in the background than in previous titles. The game also has a much more grown up/mature feel than earlier games because of its more adult storyline and the discarding of the super-deformed characters of previous titles. Once again, the new direction Square takes with the series works quite well.
Even without the mod this game is slamming!!!.
4326	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Excellent!
With a wardrobe full of style and more substance than you can shake an Entropic Blade at, Planescape: Torment is a classic that transcends the borders of gameplay and becomes a masterclass in storytelling.
Music and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department!  It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding.  The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well.  I can't describe any of this justly, though; you'll have to listen for yourself!

 One thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard, and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do. But other than that it was great.  You can actually play arcade games inside this game, and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops! There is a big mix inside this, you can drive a motorcycle, a chocobo :}, and some hover crafts. This game is really fun, and has I think about 50 hours of gameplay on three different discs, so go out and get yours today!

The Genesis port is pretty faithful to the arcade, though of course the graphics aren't as good and the music is a bit tinny. Still, this is possibly one of my favorite games of all time.

Make sure you don't make a mistake:). Same thing with naming your rival and if you want to nickname your pokemon.(You don't have to):).
I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves, that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer, isn't it? They didn't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they?
- Tomb Raider 2
Graphically, this is nothin to get too excited about. The typical top-scrolling view you expect from old-school RPGs is here. As said before, there are no cinematics, so anyone expecting FFX material are lout of luck. Being someone who loves old-school RPGs, this is a pro rather than a con. The music is nice and atmospheric, and blends in nicely with the game.
1.  Because of all of the team action, each individual lost something move wise.  I am talking about things like Knuckles' gliding and climbing abilities as well as Sonic's somersaulting.  Big no longer fishes like he did in Sonic Adventure, and the flight characters (Tails, Cream, Charmy, and Rouge) cannot fly as long or fast as they originally could.  Which sadly makes sense, seeing as those little things are carrying all of the weight of the rest of their teams.  Their cool team moves make up for most of the lost abilities, but you still have to miss Knuckles' climbing skills in those tight situations.
I really have nothing bad to say about the game.
One of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting.  It's such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game.  The female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched (which could be said of the males at times too), but other than that, it's quite good.  Also, there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh.  That may be the best thing about the game.  The story is fun.  The game is fun.  You have fun playing the game.

The third best selling Super Nintendo game of all time.  This game rocks and rocks hard.  It starts off easy in the 50 cc derby, and gets harder from there.  And since it's Mario, it's more than just racing.  We got stars, coins, mushrooms, turtle shells red and green, and of course lightning!  And then if you got board racing, grab a buddy (and hopefully a feather every now and then!) and beat each other senseless in battle mode.  Man, I kind of want to go play it right now.

I have 2 big screen TV's and the 2 rooms I use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach. Hook 1 of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved. I also like the length because I still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and don't pay attention to the cords. They even work for Bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those games.

That  said, it could have been a lot better. The initial release was bugged to  blue blazes, and despite a patch, it still feels shaky. The AI makes lots  of odd mistakes, your soldiers are unusually flimsy (particularly on uneven  ground, where they tend to trip and fall and die), and the enemy soldiers  are unfeasibly hyper-accurate from a map-length away. Furthermore, a couple  of the 'end-of-episode' missions are ferociously, unfairly tough, and  you'll probably cheat out of frustration.

All that being said, what does this dispute between "Is it a Mario game or not?" the game, besides my own personal justification for not playing the game for so many years?  What does this distinction have to do with the actual gameplay itself?  Well, quite a lot actually.  Just like "Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land" where you play as Wario, you do not control Mario.  Instead, (with only very brief exceptions) you control Yoshi. Exclusively.

There is nothing new in the game. It is simply an ordinary  shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park.
There isn't really much to choose between this and 'Quake 3' -  'Tournament' is more varied, with five different game types ('Domination',  which is vaguely similar to the video game from 'Never Say Never Again', is  a particularly good one), but the weapon types seem weedier than those in  'Quake 3', and the latter game has more of a following.
9985	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	X-Men is a fun game... on ameatur difficulty level.  When I cranked it up to Hero (since you can't get any farther than the third level on ameatur), I found it almost impossible to do anything.  I got tired of playing the levels all over again, fighting the same, almost randomly apearing enemies coming from doors at any moment and surrounding me.  Although the game may have captured the feel of the X-Men, I didn't think they did a good job with the actual game aspect, which is probably the most important thing.  If you want to play a good Marvel game, try Marvel Super-heroes: war of the Gems.  It is much more balanced and fun than Sega's attempt at making an X-men game.
there is a great storyline.
I recommend this game to people who like the other cross over games like X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. This version is the best because its arcade perfect and its to pick up and play  when you feel like fighting your heroes.
Replayability: 2/5

As with all Rare N64 games, there's a lot of replay value to be had with Perfect Dark. There are higher difficulties with additional objectives, (seemingly) smarter AI, and less available ammunition.

I don't really like to compare Torment to other RPG's. It is difficult since it uses and entire different world and a very different gallery of persons.
When we first played it, it was hard. The controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember. But once you get around the learning curve, which only took a day or 2, the game is a great ride.
In my opinion, my game is worth playing because you get to do cool stuff and cool things to monsters.

 So how about the other three Silent Hill games?  Well, I Silent Hill 2 was a fantastic game that I highly recommend (it doesn't tie in to the first installment's plot).  I've played through 98% of Silent Hill 3 (which is a sequel to Silent Hill 1, so try to play 1 before 3) and it's good, but dissapointing compared to the first two.

The sound effects are also pretty cool, although you'd hear smacks and punches most of the time. And sometimes, you might not understand what the voice is saying when you collect a riddle (We could blame Genesis hardware for that, maybe).
If you've ever played Warcraft, Starcraft, or Command & Conquer, (RTS's) and Doom or Half-Life (first person shooters) you'll get a feeling for this game as it combines base building with first person shooter. But the big difference is that with each of the 3 factions in this game, the strategies and tactics required are TOTALLY unique. None are like the other two, and yet they are very well balanced and a blast to play.

TO UNLOCK THE BOSSES [WHICH IS THE MAIN THING], YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL WITH THEIR ALREADY AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTS. THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT HEIHACHI [WHICH IS THE MAIN BOSS FOR THIS GAME], YOU GET HIM UNLOCKED. BUT THE REST OF THEM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS THE COUNTERPARTS TO GET THEIR BOSSES. EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION 2 AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET, MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CAN'T COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS! THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER AND I DARE SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OF THE TEKKEN SERIES. EVEN HAS GREAT MUSIC.
UPDATE:  Talked to someone from Activision.  He was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out there:o)  Guess it's been awhile since it was out.  Anyway, they replaced it as promised.

5064	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Overall, this game is the creepiest videog ame I have ever played.  The environments, enimies, and gameplay are designed to keep the player interested and a little on the edge.  THe only true problem with this title is that it offers nothing new, and relies very much on the style of playing created by Resident Evil.  Not that this style is bad, but within Silent Hill the gameplay just didn't feel quite as great as it did with Resident Evil, and at times I got a little bored with the wandering around the level that must be done from time to time.  Despite these few complaints this is an excellant title that fans of the "survival horror" genre should enjoy/

It's a great trilogy of games that lacks one thing: quality multiplayer. Yeah, I know, Seeds of Evil has multiplayer but it's half-assed and feels tacked on. I wanted a solid multiplayer game where I could play against my friends and kill them with the wild weapons from the games. Then along comes Turok: Rage Wars, a ridiculously fun game that gives us pure multiplayer carnage with even more over-the-top weapons.
3938	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Don't be fooled by the silly premise of this game. This is arguably one of the best turn-based strategy games around. With loads of options and weapons and randomly generated maps, this game has near-infinite replay  value. The multiplayer is perhaps the best part. It is always more fun to  play live opponents in this type of game. An added bonus is that this game  will play well even on low end systems. If you are a fan of this type of  game, and have not played it, you just cannot go wrong with Worms  Armageddon.
The game was 100% working and my friend beat the game the night he got it!

The gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples).


This version is basically the archetype of R/B/Y, following the same storyline, which (briefly) goes as the following: You're a young Pokemon trainer, working your way to become the "best that no one ever was."

Let me take you back to video game arcades in the 1980's. Namco developed a little game called "Pac-Man" that featured a 6/8 yellow circle that had an insatiable appetite for dots that may or may not have a specific flavor. Unfortunately there were four ghosts who weren't too happy about this Pac-Man eating all these dots so they would try their hardest to stop Pac-Man at all costs. However some of those dots, seemingly grown using some type of growth enhancer, endowed Pac-Man with an unusual power to totally eat the ghosts! Every now and then, someone would throw some fruit or a random food onto the play field for Pac-Man to devour, providing him with the ability to expand his palette a little.
And they  didn't stop there. They took the time to make the sound and music great.  But they didn't stop there either. It's the graphics which are the cherry  on top. It is simply BEAUTIFUL!  I've only played this game on my Voodoo 3  graphics card, so I don't know what it looks like without a good graphics  card, but you still won't be disappointed. Homeworld is a great game and  easily deserves all the awards it received.

1607	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	If Capcom was given an award for how it impacted video game history, you would find them getting one for more than one series.  (Mega Man anyone?)  And this series would be at the top of the list.  Survival horror was shot to the forefront because of this amazing game.
The graphics are obviously outdated but suprisingly I prefer it to the 3D rendering of todays RPG's. It is based on photo-realism 2d art (think Mortal Kombat 1) that used to be utilised back in the mid 90's. There is an advantage to this... it feels so much more realistic.

I say all this in an effort to convince non-AD&D people or non-RPG players out there to give Baldur's Gate a chance.  Yes, AD&D rules are numerous and complicated (I have no idea, for instance, what 6D+4 means), but don't worry too much because the computer takes care of all this for you.  Essentially, you'll encounter enemies, you'll push your spacebar (to pause the action) and point and click, directing your party members how and whom to attack.  The computer calculates all the die-rolling stuff.  You just sit back and watch the blood fly.  This is not to say, however, that BG is a brainless game.  In fact, you'll learn quickly that "Fools Rush In" if you don't think about battle strategy.  Put simply, Baldur's Gate achieves a perfect balance: it both satisfies hardcore D&D folk who have long clamored for an accurate PC RPG experience while also not scaring away newbies.
Lasting Appeal:
First off, this game is huge. You have to play through this game twice to get the entire experience and real ending to this game. It has a second quest, much like the old school Ghosts and Goblins, if you can remember that game... but with its own unique invereted way.

Max Payne is a great game for FPS and I'm starting all over again, playing the game. I highly recommend it to gamers who love shooting things up... Have a blast!

9165	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Lots and LOTS of random battles, dumb characters, dumb gameplay, graphics that would look bad on the SNES (except for the constant battles). I played this when there were no other RPGs on the Playstation and I had the flu. With so many great RPGs out now, there is no reason for this game.

The story was always weird to me, and felt like patchwork, but now that I am older and wiser, I can make sense out of it now. After playing through this recently, I can saw that for its time, it may have been seen as the greatest ever, but I have a few grips I don't like about it. Yet, still it is good game! I played Crisis Core first, so next will be Dirge of Cerebus. To any fan or newcomer to Final Fantasy, such as myself, I highly recommend this game, but you will have to set aside alot of time to get the most out of it.

The fact that you can guide other privates into battle (not to mention boss them around) is a nice addittion although the AI dissapoints a bit.
There are many instances of dark humour (you can attack zombies with their own body parts)and pleasant surprises I don't want to spoil as well (including funny but gross little scenes and interesting variations on the creatures (specifically in the zombie town)).  The opening title film is also great (although it unfortunately often just plays the music while you stare at a black screen -- just start the game enough times and you'll see it).  Playing this game is better than watching the X-Files (and it is much more gory and "adult").
It's pretty good compaired to some games, but most games have much smoother control. But since this is one of the first N64 games, I'm going to give it a good rating considering there are no PS2s, GCs, or Xboxs.

This is as good as Tournament deathmatch games get.  I'm telling you, its that fun.  You can download many great mods for it also!  If your friends own it, give em a call!  Its fun to play in games with your friends.  This game features a story mode like setting, where you are a character in a Tournament.

Wait, there's still more to combat. Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items, there is also horseback combat. You can ride around on Epona, a fierce, wild, mare who only listens to you, and shoot things with your bow and arrow. There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.
Tournament mode is the big one - you start with a variety of Nintendo characters to choose from and one course to play on. Completing rounds earns you experience points, which are used to unlock other courses and characters. You also get trophies for finishing in the top three and Birdie Badges for getting a birdie (or better) on a hole. As with similar games, your goal is to unlock all courses and characters and collect all the badges.

 Graphically, this game looks pretty ragged on a widescreen computer at its original resolution, but this doesn't matter because there is an easy to use mod that allows you to play it in widescreen.  Using the mod, it looks fantastic in widescreen.  The artwork for the levels is quite detailed and lovely--it made me long for the days of 2d graphics to be honest.  I found full on widescreen at 1280 x 800 to be too zoomed out, so I made a custom resolution for 960 x 600 and found that to be just about right.  In fact, there are a number of good mods that people generally recommend you get for the game which you can find using google.  Most of these simply fix bugs and things of that nature rather than adding entirely new material.
789	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Love this game. Although the graphics aren't the best since it's N64 and earlier on.... I enjoy everything about it (still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the 'invisible walls' and oddly prism shaped bottles etc). The story is well done and unlike other Zelda games, all of the items are used. There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield (I have one such copy) but even with that in mind, it's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub. It all comes down to this game.... definitely worth your time to play.
I was raised on a steady diet of Mortal Kombat and nothing really prepared me for how hard this game was.
The only bad thing about the DC are a few 2nd gen games such as Test Drive 6 and Rainbow Six which hold the system back somewhat. And, needless to be said, it cannot playback your Citizen Kane DVD.
Fifth, character classes have no maximum stats. This SEVERELY WEAKENS the distinctions between the character classes, and for those hackers out there, it makes it impossible to have a "maxed-out" character.
 For those who don't know Crash Bandicoot first came out in the 90's as a standard, straight-forward platformer. You're a mutated Bandicoot named Crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist Dr. Neo Cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend. In Warped Dr. Cortex now works for Uka Uka (The brother of Aku Aku) an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world. He instructs Cortex to go through time and collect Crystals and Gems that hold extreme power. Crash has to literally race through time and jump, spin, and dance his way through time to retrieve them before Cortex gets ahold of them.
I've played a lot of Playstation games since then, but none has matched the level of intensity and sheer horror of Silent Hill. This game earned the five star rating that I gave it. I only hope this review will convey just how good it is.
The story is what made me come back to this game so many times that I've memorized the whole game.  It starts out with this elite group of highly trained soldiers called SeeDs from a cadet called Garden.  The main character, Squall, has just passed his SeeD exam and is preparing for his first mission.  He meets with a young woman named Rinoa, who is fighting for her state's independence.  Through many twists in the story, they end up in a quest to destroy a sorceress from the future who threatens to compress all time to dominate the universe.
5681	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	To start this off let me say I seem to be one of the few that enjoy this version as well as the others because it seems that if you like 7 you can't like 8 or the other way around.  I enjoyed 7 a lot when I was a kid and still do today and it is the same with this one.  The graphics are a great improvment from 7 to 8 and anyone can see that. The story is good at times and slow at others and at times feels slow when your playing it but that happens with all games. It still was good enough to keep me intrested. The junctioning system was different and I didn't mind it but it had problems. It was easy to figure out what magic to junction to make my health maxed out and when I got it maxed out I found myself not useing magic through the entire game so it wouldn't bring down my stats. So if always felt like it was missing something since I never used magic through the entire game so this bothered me but not too much. The other thing I had a problem with was the world in wich the game takes place felt empty. Most final fantasy games have a lot of areas to explore and visit and this one had a lot of empty space. It didn't effect the storyline but I like to do side quest so it felt like thay coud have added to it.
The online is great too.  This is one of Quakes finest for the PC.

139	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	The video quality is fine but if you have your hdmi plugged directly into your tv and have a separate receiver for audio, the cables are way too short to fit in both, so right now if I want to use the better video signal, I have to use the tv audio. I'll try to rip open the cables to make them reach but this is really a design flaw, although many newer receivers have hdmi connectors on them, there are a lot that don't.

8th Level: Streets - The best level for the fact that every challenge is as easy as it is hard.

You play(well you actually play several characters)Cloud Strife, an ex-member of Soldier(kind of an army police sort of thing working for Shinra) who has joined with a team Avalanche who are against Shinra...a corporation that is draining mako energy out of the planet with reactors (without mako energy the planet will die). But what starts out as a mission against Shinra becomes a struggle to save the world. It's more than that, though, so I will leave you to find out for yourself. There are alot of side quests too. Like chocobo breeding(Oh yeah,You gotta try that) or the gold saucer which is like a big arcade.
While daring, this visual style gives "Yoshi's Island" the appearance of being marketed for small children.  While Mario has always been whimsical and colourful, "Yoshi's Island" takes this tendency to even a more extreme place, and as a result has the potential to turn off a lot of players (my college buddies from back in the day, for instance).  Appearances are ultimately deceiving however; not only is "Yoshi's Island" one of the best platformers out there, with deep, engrossing gameplay, but to fully complete the game and 100% each level is QUITE challenging.

Always one of my personal favorites, it was nice to see the blue clad Lin Kuei travel around on a quest full of puzzles, traps, and secret goodies. The way they used the original "motion capture" method like in the first MK games also made this feel like it really WAS part of the Mortal Kombat series. Plus, with cameos from many of Mortal Kombats' lore, its fun and quite catchy to see who pops outta nowhere to be a boss or potential plot twists the first time around.

This game excels in both gameplay and storyline. I find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they "hate" such a masterpiece.
By the way for those of you who agree with my review lets hope for Megaman 9 soon
Alot of the GF's have some of the same abilities to start out with, so pay attention to which one give you the abilities to junction certain stats. You will need to divide them up accordingly, so that your whole party has even statistics, so then you will be able to draw with them also. Always leave one party member with a magic command though so you can use cures, and draw with your other two. Your GF's level up as long as they're equipped to you, even if you don't use them in battle.

It's probably the only 3D game that's ever played on our  clunky home computer without crashing or giving us glitches.  It also has  an atmosphere that constantly sends prickles down your spine and encourages  you to do more than shoot everything in sight.
All in all, this game is well worth buying.

4729	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To try and describe a game like SOTN is near impossible. Think of it as an onion that as a gamer you will peel away at for years. The creators of this masterpiece were either obsessive compulsive designers hell bent on blowing the minds of the gaming world, or mad geniuses creating a masterpiece the same way Picasso brought a painting into existence. No other game that exists today can match the depth and scope of this marvel.
Graphics are pretty nice for the time this game was released.  There are cinematics that are of course nicer looking, but many elements of the actual game are gorgeous.  The animations for when you use your GFs (guardian forces, formerly "espers" in other games) in battle are pretty awesome too.
I highly recommend this Mega Memory Card to any owner of a Dreamcast!

5689	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I'm a huge Final Fantasy guy, but for me, 8 is just very close to trash.  I tried to play it right when it came out but I couldn't stand it right from the get go so I quit early.  I tried to play it again a few years ago and the same exact thing happened.  Finally a little while ago, I forced myself through it. No exaggeration.
5484	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I LOVED THIS GAME~
What has me dock a star off this review is that the challenge feels cheap at times. There is a way or two how more than half your health will drain from an enemy using their attack (Not the standard fighting moves). Everything else is great.
Fun: 10/5
Another cool option is how you can walk  around your headquarters, the Carrington institute. Here, you can talk to  your boss, Daniel Carrington (although not much!) and you can learn how to  fist fight, be more accurate with each weapon, learn about other characters  and ships, and learn how to use cool gadgets like the CamSpy (a hovering  little camera, that is controlled by you by just moving it around with the  joy stick).
5910	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Could have been a lot better. to put it simply, to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan ever,me, i was totally diappointed by this game. i hate the whole modern/futuristic look that this game has. even ff7 had this to a point. i want this to be like fantasy..castles, swords, mages, kings, knights, wizards. i hate that there is no armor or accessories, plus i hate that there are no magic points, and magic is not earned. the experience points thing stinks. leveling up/money mean nothin in this game.  my favorite part of RPG is building up wrecking machine armies.  ergo my sabin, celes, edgar, and terra army from ff3/6.  in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up.  this game is soooo dumbed down.  the villain or lack thereof is horrible.  BRING BACK KEFKA!  the gf's take like 20 years to finish making battles so annoying, instead of fun like in ff6 and chrono cross.  the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking.  plus every character is essentially the same, each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks. maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy 8 i woulnt have been disappointed. this remains the only ff game ever that i haven't finished, i stopped playing on disc 3. if u want a good RPG to play, get FF9 which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great. also i recommend ff3/6 which is undoubtable the best FF game ever, and arguably the best game ever. i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games.  don't waste your time or money with final fantasy 8.
can shoot limbs off people or make em squirt blood all over the place.


4742	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	So much has already been said about this game. One of the best and most riveting games on the PSX. At the end of the castle there is a surprise waiting for you! I will not spoil it. The graphics are impressive, for it's time, as well as the animation and control. The music and sounds fit the subject very well. Definitely a game worth while getting and playing. Fun, orignal and not to be missed. A game to be passed down or willed to a family member :)
1-Angel Island 80%
It has been a while and GRAPHICS have improved immensely since this game was produced.
Three thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Eggman sets free Chaos. The Master Emerald is shattered and Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald's shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog sets off and defeats Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles "Tails" Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails' emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city's ruins. Sonic and Tails set off searching for emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Dr. Eggman and Chaos. Dr. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, which shoots down Sonic and Tails's pursuing plane.
The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages.
I only have a couple of complaints about the game, but they are very minor gripes. Like, the blue tunic and the red tunic are gotten way late in the game, which isn't a bad thing, but you nearly get them consecutively. The blue tunic should have been available a little earlier.
1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.

3333	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Oh what fun for PlayStation to pick up rights to the classic Pac-Man game, like they did for Sonic the Hedgehog & several other formerly popular characters. Plus this is a great game...Happy Gaming!
Overall, this game has so much to offer.  I am always tempted to replay it because of things I missed, such as getting Cloud's final limit break Omnislash or beating Ruby and Emerald Weapon.  Just twenty minutes into the game, I was hooked.  It was the first RPG I had ever played and ever since I loved the genre.
Aside from graphics, Giants presents and engaging and hilarious story with excellent gameplay.  Just when I felt I'd conquered one aspect, the game switches gears, races, or genres and suddenly becomes a new game.  Giants hints at being a first person shooter, a racing game, a strategy game, and an adventure game.  Unlike many games that have tried to combine different elements and failed, Giants makes each transition smoothly and succesfully.

6041	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	My best advise is to never buy a memory card online! I couldn't save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time. I suggest not to buy memory cards online.
There is, however, one slight problem about a certain materia. In this game, there is a Support Materia called Elemental. What this materia does is it adds a connected materia's element(s) to your attack (if equipped on a weapon) or protects you from connected elements (if equipped on armor). The problem comes in play if you equip this to your weapon. If you run into an enemy who is strong against the element(s) that is/are attached to Elemental, you have no way to change the elemental properties that the weapon currently possesses. So, you may have to start back to your last save point if the situation gets really bad and all you can do is attack.
The graphics for this game was superb when it first came out. No one still really cared too much about them yet & Square really showed them off for this game (this game was originally in production for the N64) except for the fact that you have blocks as hands! I believe the main game for the N64 wasn't completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having CG clips for the PlayStation they went with that system instead. So for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one, im pretty sure thats your answer. The CG movies still look amazing for the ps1, granted that Square got better at it with FFVIII. Either way, Square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake (to make this game look REALLY NICE) which is still in question, however they have other games they're working on now
1121	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	First off, this game is very good considering it had very good graphics (for an N64) and sound. Second of all, the storyline is the best I've seen in ages. The boy from the woods that no one knows becomes the Hero of Time... I would reveal more, but I do not want to spoil the game. Third, the gameplay and controls are easy to master, so you probably won't be swinging your sword at an enemy when you intended to throw bombs at it like games with complicated buttons. (; Fourth, the thing that makes Zelda, well, Zelda! The dungeons. The puzzles in them are chalenging and fun. The scenery in the dungeons (and everything else) is amazing. Fith, the enemies are unique and mystique, making the worlds you explore even cooler. Overall, this game is THE top must have of the N64 gaming system. ...

Thief has 12 mission but they are very large and will take you long to complete,It has a training mission too even that is very scary and fun to play. The level design is fantastic,You need to sneak arround and explore Posh mansion,Haunted mine,Well gaurded prison,Ancient ruins,Haunted cathedrals ect. Thief's graphics are not that great but more than enough for the fantastic gameplay,The sound recording is excellent infact the sound is the most important for the gameplay. The villans in blood are really scarry,the skull faced hammer haunts are the most scary villans in a computer game,It moves very fast impossible to outrun and very hard to kill,If one of them spots you then you are finished,You will know when you see play return to the haunted cathedral. My favorite is "Return to the cathedral",It is the most scary level in the game. The AI is very good,The gaurds are smart and they react very well to every little sound. Thief has great weapons,The bow and arrow is the most realistic weapon in a computer game, The blackjack is my favorite weapons,Almost all (human AI only) mission can be completed with just the blackjack weapon. The voice acting in thief is fantastic,One of the best ever in a computer game,Stephan Russell who did the voice for Garrett has done a fantastic job,Surprisingly he did the voice for many other charecters in the game and one cant belive it is the same guy.

905	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Banjo-Kazooie is an action adventure game in the style of Super Mario 64. However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9).
In terms of variety, Metal Gear Solid VR Missions does a great job.  There are so many different varied missions here to keep you busy.  You'll also be able to unlock the Ninja and a couple of other secrets, although, none of these things is very lucrative.

I have a few things I want to add.  If you're wondering if it works well on a PS2.  Yes, perfectly.  And one more thing.  I bought the game used, not greatest hits, and it had trouble because of the condition it was in, so I bought a new copy that is the greatest hits version.  The older one comes with a case that is very annoying because it is really hard to get disc 2 out.  I was worried about having to bend the disc to get it out.

It's awkward, it's punchy, and buggy. It  restricts your creativity in a way that I've yet to experience in any other  Sim game. You are limited to two island scenarios to begin, and they are in  themes like Dinosaur, and Space Ship ... and they are VERY tiny -- not much  to work with.  Creative-wise, you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme -- IE: your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaur's stomache as one of the rides. *shudder*

By combining different character in special formations, you can also stumble upon combination attacks, but there are so many possible formations that this task is well beyond daunting.

However, there are setbacks to this awesome game, as I will now mention.  I will have to state that the storyline wasn't as gripping as in RE2, nor as complicated with multiple scenarios.  The cinematics, while the finest I have ever seen, are very short in length, so their overall effect isn't as high as I could have hoped.  Also, after beating the game so many times, this game is now to me very easy for I know Nemesis' weaknesses, and can easily exploit them (email me for free tips).  Also, the music isn't for the most part as good or scary or sad as in RE2.  However, some of the tunes at the very end are absolutely astounding and alone are worth purchasing the soundtrack (well, I did just for those three tracks).
This is perhaps the best Playstation game of all time.  It is the best Castlevania hands down (with the excellent Circle of the Moon coming in second) and is the most breathtaking in the series.

Another thing i loved about this game were all the secrets.  I don't think i ever found them all, but i did find the casino and the lazy shell among others...i think the only way to beat culex is with the lazy shell or the star egg which i never had, if someone can do it without any of these things id love to see it.  i never got the 50 jump thing, which i think youd need so kid of cheat to do that bc its near impossible.  i have absolutely no complaints about this game other than they need a sequel.  if you love mario or rpgs.  buy this game immediately, though i couldn't imagine you not already knowing about this game if you love either one of those things.

The possibilities are limitless and Jedi's even play a role in the game, albeit sometimes minimal (it's by chance that you'll have force sensitive characters, however I find that the Alliance gets more).

The problems with RE 3 lie mainly in the game's production. It's nigh-on impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so, and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot. The baddies are souped-up versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially. You waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths. Also, Nemesis, though an excellent inclusion, is again too intense for the early stages of the game, and more often than not you'll find yourself cursing Capcom while waiting for your game to reload after he's dispatched you.

Turning on and off the sound, the secret project movies, and custom tailoring the game to what you want it to display is fairly easy.  There's even an "Auto-Save" feature which is a nice touch if you need to break away form your game quickly.  There are still many people that play and use this game online, and the online interface is just as easy to use as the rest of the game.

From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best.

187	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love this thing, It makes your controller look badass and is so soft.  It has a great feel to it, way better than plastic, even if you have a Black controller this will improve it.  The seams on the side are my only tiny concern.  Add this with the Grip-it, blue analog covers and you have a great controller for cheap.  I can`t say enough about the comfort.  fantastic!
Jade Coccoon has a dreamlike fairy-tale quality that I enjoy. There is character development and an actual plot. The sound track is beautiful; I wish I could find it. The character Po tells some good stories (the first about Alcana is the best), which is a nice diversion. My favorite element of the game is that there is no clear "good guy" and "bad guy", there is conflict on both sides. It also touches on some theological questions in an interresting way. The graphics are also quite good for a PlayStation game, and actually add to the mood and setting rather than just act as flashy eye-candy.

The final boss, Ogre/True Ogre(I count him as two villains)looks to be very powerful and very difficult to defeat, but there's a special trick to defeat him as though you were teaching a tired cat to yawn: You just gotta play as King and kick the s*** out of him. Trust me, I've done it twice. You fight Ogre as King, he's got no hope. Period
Expect to see the coolest Mega Man X weapons.  There are two extremely powerful weapons called Storm Tornado and Fire Wave, which make dashing through the levels a breeze.  These two weapons happen to take out most enemies in a matter of seconds.  All the weapons in the game are awesome (even though the Electric Spark and Rolling Shield are fairly weak, they are pretty fun to mess around with).  Capcom was never able to create such cool weapons in a Mega Man game again.

The missions, the ships, the dogfights, the graphics, the storyline, everything is top notch. I would have to also say that this game is underrated.

And so, from this point, and with the city infested by the waking dead, we have our hero Jill Valentine enter the story. And the adventure begins.
I can't rave enough. Possibly equalled in terms of absorbing entertainment only by it's own sequels, FF 7 is still a rewarding, hugely entertaining, and very special game. Totally recommended.

  If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.

In brief, Final Fantasy VIII is an excellent RPG. I whole heartedly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series, as well as those looking for a nice change of pace within the RPG genre.
4766	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I enjoy RPG games. Really, I do. But for some reason, I couldn't get into this one as much as I thought I could. But I've looked at all the reviews  on this board, and most are raving about it. But what I'm also wondering is  if these very positive reviews are from mostly die-hard RPGers, and/or  Dungeon & Dragons fans.

Pros:
6700	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I still remember that I bought this game along with the GameBoy when they were released in 1989 when I was still a teenager. It has everything a Mario fan could expect! Graphics are very similar to Super Mario Bro. for the NES as well as the gameplay and no saving feature! In addition, there are some new elements like divided road at the end of a stage and could ride an airplane in the sky or a submarine in the deep ocean. That's is why this game is one of my favorites of all time!
6977	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Happy
3.  The game is short, but it is genuinely replayable.  At the beginning of the game, you choose one of three distinct character classes.  The beginning missions for each class are totally different.  The later missions are the same, but each class has such distinct abilities that you have to play them somewhat differently.
5468	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Another game I found from my childhood. I haven't played this in so long. Definitely a great PlayStation original for PlayStation enthusiasts like myself.
  Resistances are just the defense that your character has against the elements.  Each one is ranked separately; so therefore you could have a resistance of 75 in fire but only 25 in Lightning.  At the beginning of the game you have no resistances at all -- you have to find armor or other things that give these resistances to you.  Also, you may not raise your resistances above 75 unless you have items that let you add points to your "maximum resist".
I think it's all the pieces put together: a beautiful crafted world, the progress when playing - from a child into a young man -, the challenges you'll face and overcome, the music that playes a big role in the game, the use of time: day and night, future and past etc. etc.
What really grabs me about the RE series, however, is not the wide variety of monsters or the action per se, but the storyline. The game begins with and is occasionally interrupted with movie sequences which explain some of the backstory, which heightens the feel of having been thrown face-first into a cerebral splatter film. It is an "interactive" experience in the truest sense. All that's missing is zombie brains on your shoes.
856	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Being the third major installment of the all time great C&C seris tiberian sun was released in 1999 with enormous anticipation and fanfare. Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam.

Overall, I would  have to encourage people to buy all the X-Com games and Shadow Watch before  buying this one.  And even then, I would replay the former titles again  before sending buying this one.  Firefights in Jagged Alliance are  needlessly long and indecisive, there is little variation between combat  locations and opponents, and there is a lot of built in frustration in the  fact that your units are so vastly inferior to those controlled by the  computer.  This is a game with a lot of subtle problems that should have  been caught in the beta testing.
Third person shooters weren't very frequent on PS1 and when they did come by they were usually pretty bad. Syphon Filter proved that you can make this genre work on the PS1. The game is still really fun today and was way ahead of its time. A well done camera, great lock-on system, a decent story with memorable characters, a kick-ass arsenal of guns, and genius level design. Who would have thought a third person shooter would be this good in the late 90s? Eidetic and 989 Studios did.


If you're going to play with the N64 system you should, IMO, try to get the most out of it. And while the added 4 mb of memory may not be required to play your favorite game, at this price, its still a worthy addition.

5023	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	What a perfect day to review a dreary, scary classic video game.  This is one of those rainy, cold and windy April days.  We have them every year. After being teased with exceptionally warm weather a couple days ago, days like today make you realize how lucky you are to experience warmer than normal temperatures.  I could sit here and talk about the weather all day (and I probably will after this review is finished) but it's time to review a game that was groundbreaking at the time of its release.  A game that was VERY disturbing then, and just as disturbing today.
4147	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Age of Empires, Age of Kings, Age of Mythology series is definitely the best ever sires of real time strategy games.  In all versions of the game you are allowed to control both the armies and economies of your nation.  You can build buildings, creature soldiers or peasants, even priests.  Your peasants you command to do the different menial tasks such as farming, mining, and building castles.  While your armies roam the land either defending your peasants, sieging enemy castles, or raiding their peasants.  Priest have the power to convert both peasants and soldiers.  If you like being king of the world, this is for you.  Finally, I just want to differentiate between the games.  Age of Empires is the oldest of the games and should run on any computer, but I wouldn't recommend the game without either the Rise of Rome Expansion Pack or just buying the Age of Empires Gold Edition.  These two correct many problems with the original Age of Empires.  Next game up the latter for medium computers is Age of Kings (that's what I'm still playing.) It can run on just about any computer with sixty four megs of ram and a two hundred megahertz processor.  I use it on a five hundred megahertz and a one point four gigahertz.  Next game up is the Age of Mythology.  This introduces a whole new realm of playing to the sires.  This one you civilization chooses different gods to worship and is given power from them.  Unfortunately you only get two really spectacular god powers each game and you can only use them once, but then it keeps the game to more strategy and less luck and wildcards.  (It is fun to get the wildcards when you have them though!)  This game should have a processor of I would say at least a six hundred and a graphics card at least thirty two megabytes; and lastly this is not the game for everybody.  I still use Age of Kings/Conquerors not because of my computer, but because I don't like all the crazy stuff in Mythology; I think it distracts from the medieval battle tactics.  Really choosing between Mythology and Age of Kings is just a matter of personal opinion.  I'd say download both demos and try them both; or if you have the money to blow, buy them both.  Either way I think you'll love both of them.  Well that's all for me.  This is just a general over view don't take my words as gold check out the specs and requirements yourself.  I just wanted to help point you in the right direction.
There are also many bonus items to get, King K Rool Crowns, Banana fairy photographs, a Rareware coin and a N64 coin. For the Rareware coin you play the Jetpack game, and for the N64 coin you play the original Donkey Kong game which will drive you crazy because you only get one live.
The story is as epic as any great Final Fantasy should be, although I do admit that the ending is a bit lax...still, it was followed up by sequels, so at least the story did continue.  Most of the characters are interesting, even colorful (Cid and Barrett's constant swearing definitely added flavor to this FF entry!).  Cloud's complex relationships with Aeris and Tifa are among the story's highlights, and of course, the culmination of Cloud facing his former friend and idol.
5428	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	This game is not the version I remember. It feels very clunky and the load times are hardly tolerable. Try another version for your MK3 fix.

You start off as a mercenary, an Ex-Soldier named Cloud who is working with a group named 'Avalanche', a team of members who infiltrates Shin-Ra's biggest Mako city, Midgar. Mako is destroying the planet & Avalanche (known as hippies or treehuggers) is trying to stop that from happening. What Cloud doesn't realize is he's closer to Shin-Ra then he thinks. And a mysterious man known as Sephiroth suddenly attacks Midgar after a tragic event that took place in.. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII

I like it so far, but my one complaint with it is that there is alot of talking to people and very little focus on advancing your characeter through battle. It would be nice to make the next title something more like the old Final Fantasy games. I was thinking of Neverwinter Nights or Dungeon Seige. I prolly go with the Nights.

Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.

1077	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I remember when my parents bought this game for my older brother in the 90's.

My brother would play it every day trying to beat every obstacle and this game is truly fun, when my brother let me play the game I was hooked, I did need some of his help on many things but that didn't bother me from having fun. I enjoyed this game and anybody will. I usually don't like these kind of games but this game is amazing and I love to play it. Nintendo 64 truly does bring back memories and their games are fun too.
6392	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When I bought this game I got cought up in it for a week.  People are complaining that it didn't run good on there system.  Thats because they have a PII processor.  PCGAMER magazine said that if you have anything worse than PIII 450 128mb ram than it won't work good.  That is true it  works grat on a PIII but the game is not optimxed for PII.  I have a PIII  600 128megs of ram and the best graphics board and I installed the 300mb  Compact install and it worked fine.

This is simply one of the best, most immersive games for the N64. The music is great and the storyline is well thought out. IMHO the first person shooter segments are the most enjoyable though the flying segments are also well done. It is nice to have the option of fighting fewer or more bad guys - especially if you have kids playing.

There are a plethora of  unique and magical items, none of which I have seen repeated yet.  THere is  also the new concept of "socketed" weapons and armor, which  allows the player to socket magical gems into their weapons and gain  bonuses from fire damage to life-stealing.  THe unique items also change  the way your character looks, which means the player has more of a  connection with their character and keeps them on the lookout for items  which may look cool when placed on the character.
7510	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Being into the racing sims, I would say that most of it was excellent and a lot of effort was put in. The only real flaw I see in the game is the selection of tracks. There's a basic 3 to start (Ranging from beginner to expert), and one secret course (Which I've raced on before). The control on the cars are mostly excellent, except for only a few blind corners that you have to floor the brakes and prepare for a lot of oversteer (And a possible spinout). But still definitely worth getting.


4200	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Spectacular game. Just a killer waiting for the second. But a must have for all gamers.
The graphics haven't aged well, but still have the ability to scare. One of the first survival horror-games to utilise fully modelled realtime environments, the camera angles and darkness/fog make for some truly chilling views. You find your way with the aid of a map, torch and a radio that emits static only when an enemy is close. Since darkness and fog are very cleverly employed in the game (ostensibly to keep the slowdown to a minimum, it also serves to heighten the tense atmosphere) what you hear and do not see is a lot scarier than what you do see. There are also several of the truly cool, nightmarish vignettes that the series has become famous for - Pyramid-Heads in steel cages, the Mark of Samael, and terribly wasted corpses cling to walls and ceilings and give us a deeper sense of the ravages of satanism.

The Special Stage is different from that in Sonic 1. Instead of collecting 50 rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of an act, you collect 50 rings and jump into a bunch of rotating stars that pop up when you hit a lamp post. You also race through a half-pipe and need to collect a certain number of rings before each checkpoint. When you clear all the checkpoints with the required amounts of rings, you get a Chaos Emerald.
I have played this game almost as much as I have Golden Eye 64, but not quite as much. If you are looking for a good quality game with a very high replay value then this is a great game to check out.



So, basically, the graphics aren't superb, it was one of the 1st games for the 64, and you can see the many advancements they made for RS. But this game is still good. SOFE & RS are 2 completely different games. If you love RS or BFN, and you haven't played this one 'cause you think it is inferior, then think again. It holds its own and stands up still. There is even a level on speeder bikes! Reminded me a bit of Racer, but not quite the same; it's hard to go fast and stay in control in this. There aren't any ships to choose in mission like RS, basically you start with the Snow Speeder, go onto Dash's ship that is much like the Falcon. And apparently there's a code to fly an X wing in the last level, and cheats to play as the AT-ST, but I didn't try them.


Code Veronica plays exactly like the other Resident Evil games (I've got them all), so if you like that style of control, you're in business here. What really sets Code Veronica apart from it's siblings, however are the graphics. I think I can confidently say that this is the best looking zombie game ever made. You can see every pus-oozing sore on those pathetic zombies, and environments are fully rendered in 3D.

Quake 2 for the N64 is a tad better, but if you love FPS Doom-type games like me, by all means, get this game now!
4= HIt or Miss Imo due to the character design styled more like 1 & 2 than 3

The PROS: There is so much content packed in this game, you get your money's worth instantly. First off, the graphics, music, sound effects, controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64. Then, there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later. This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it. Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time. The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them. The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself (the tracks are huge so getting 3 more players is the best way to go.) This game will take you awhile to beat since it's quite challenging and that leads into...
Bottom line, get this game only after getting the first 2 in the series, but please get it. It is much better than Capcom's lackluster effort at modern Resident Evil games.

Okay, in the modern era of 3D the graphics are a little dated.  Sure it's just sprite animation, but the beauty is in the details Chris Sawyer and his team added.  In a 3D game (see the awful SimThemePark and SimCoaster for examples), this level of minute detail can't be added, there just aren't polygon pushing graphics cards in existence to do it.  So the reality is they are only dated because the game industry says 3D is the thing, and not because they are less beautiful and detailed.
7832	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The game was in great shape as advertised by the seller.  Mastering it takes a bit of out-of-the-box problem solving.  Keeping it real is no way to win.

The Bad News:  If you're looking for something you won't shelf  after you're done with it, look someplace else.

The character development aspects are wonderful.  You can to some extent control which characters will like others and how well they get along.  And, the closer they become, the more interesting things can happen.  This can even effect battles.  These aren't major things, but they certainly add a lot more depth and personality to the game.  You control which skills the characters learn as well.  Not only battle skills, but also metalwork, alchemy, cooking, art, photography, music...  all sorts of things.  And, all of the skills actually have some good use to them, rather than just being there as a gimmick.
-I kind of wished it was a SONIC ONLY adventure...but ohwell
Nonetheless, a solid effort and worth the ... whether you're a Trekkie or not. If you're starving for good FPS action, this will definitely tide you over until the next real piece of gaming genius comes along, whenever that may be. The expansion pack, due in early May, I'll be buying on the day it comes out.
You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.

5486	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	ok, I have to be honest.  This game totally rocked.  The graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use, (Such weaponry as the soul reaver, Kain Reaver, Ariel reaver, Fire Reaver, Etc) is impressive and totally sucks you in.  There are two reasons that I gave this game 4 stars instead of five stars: It can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction, and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels.  On the other hand, this game is worth buying.  I enjoyed exploring the  dark, scary, gut wrenching and yet unique world of Nosgoth, and I am hoping to get Blood Omen 1.  Either way, this game is fun.  It's impossible not to enjoy this game.
However, if you're a Space Invaders fan, this Super Nintendo version won't disappoint, as it is just like the arcade original. Just try not to expect a major improvement.

Battle System (8/10): Nothing really wrong with the battle system.  It's a variant of turn-based, with a small bar in the corner indicating who will go next.  While the bar does let you see when you're characters will go, I didn't really find it all that useful.  What keeps this section from a perfect score is the abilities-and how you level them up.  Using them over and over again strengthens your magic, but not how you'd expect. SPEED increases, not strength.  I found this very frustrating and pointless. The speed doesn't really increase enough to make much difference- and leveling spells takes forever.

Since this game came out I've played Star Fox 64, Rez, Child of Eden, and Sky Gunner. I've played Panzer Dragoon Orta. And I've cried silent tears that Crimson Dragon was released for Xbox One instead of for a current-gen system. But...

Final Fantasy VII was a reasonably good FF game, but it was also the first Playstation FF game, and had some advantages which were, at the time, unique to it. It was incumbent upon FFVIII to give us something more -- something cooler and better. It failed.
 The gameplay of Silent Hill is similar to Resident Evil. Pretty much the same controls and but with harder puzzles. It also includes a sense of realism that eludes itself from the typical health bar and ammo screen. Playing Silent Hill 1 you feel more like a detective unraveling a mystery. Your on the edge of your seat the entire way and you just want to know whats going to happen next because you honestly can never predict what's going to happen in this town.

430	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II. Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.
A little background: I'm not sure about other consoles at the time, but the PS1, unlike todays Sony consoles, had a different control scheme. Instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character, you used the arrow buttons. The analogue sticks didn't have much use. Actually with some games no use at all. In other games like Spyro the Dragon you had the option to turn them on, but for some of those games it was glitchy. Ape Escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first PS1 game to solely use analogue controls and I'm happy it did. I think Ape Escape is the best moving ps1 game I have ever played due to analogue controls. It makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time. Now all games use this control scheme for the better.

8558	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Some (like girls who are X-Men fans) may complain that Jean Grey, Rouge, and Storm were not playable characters and call these X-Men games very sexest, but you got Psylocke - what more do you want!?  It would be nice to have them, but Jean, Rouge, and Storm would be unfair because they can fly and are too powerful.  If they were included in the game, developers would have to dramtically limit their powers (to make them well balance with other X-Men) and that would piss off gamers.

1129	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I was always a fan of Zelda when it first came out for the original Nintendo.  This is a fairly challenging game and I got bored with it quickly.  There isn't a lot of violence in this game but I think it's too advanced for kids to play.
GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
3262	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I really like this product. It has a good looking. And also it has a pretty good size. I really like this product.
So why four stars?  Well, like many people, I have my subjective, nit-picky problems.  First, the pathfinding is pretty weak.  It's mostly okay when you're out in the open, but in dungeons, the pathfinding is flat-out horrible.  I barely escaped the Firewine dungeon alive because whenever I'd get into a battle and order my commands, my party members would then stupidly go off in six separate and unexpected directions.  Second, although the world is huge, it does get tedious trudging across the BG map.  At times, the game can feel like a chore to explore that unnamed wilderness section that's located leagues away from where you truly need to go only because, well, you feel there might be something interesting there.  Third, going up levels takes a long time.  Don't get me wrong, I realize that going up levels shouldn't be too easy to accomplish, but it's kind of disheartening to only be a level seven fighter at the end of the game (because there's an experience point cap of 89,000) with thirty-odd hit points.  Either raise the cap or make level limits a bit lower.  Lastly, although hardcore gamers may love the myriad spells, weapons, and potions, I felt there were too many.  Your party members don't have many slots for carrying items, and all those items you find during your travels (potions in particular) become annoying (should I use such-and-such potion immediately? should I save it for a big battle? should I sell it and make money? should I simply leave it behind).
5301	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I don't want to diss anyone who likes this game, but I can't really see much good in this game.  The graphics are not really anything speical.  It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you can't see the enemy until you've had a major loss of life.  The control is rather overly complicated and isn't exactly user freindly.  The sound is okay, but it seems to make you a little tence.  The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys.  I have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven't beaten the first level by myself.  The missons seem a bit vague and you think "okay... what the heck do I do now?" too often.  When I play this, I can't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game's fault.....  Even if you are in to army stuff, you might want to rent this first.  If this is your kind of thing, I recomend Medal of Honor: Underground or Syphon Filter.
7655	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is FABULOUS.  A friend of mine was visiting and brought it with him.  He finally managed to convince me to play it, and swore I'd like it.  I the skeptic that I am, especially involving me enjoying a golf game, highly doubted it.

How about memory cards?  You can buy a memory card for less than 5 bucks for your PS1 console.  I am totally serious about that.  What a FANTASTIC price to store your memory for your many video game adventures.  Trust me, you'll need a memory card for all the fairly long games available for the PS1.
If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it's dirt cheap to buy.. (haha) Put the money towards something BETTER.
In the end starcraft battlechest at 19 dollars is a great value with over 60 hours of gameplay for singleplayer alone. I only played through the single player because I was scared of getting absolutely and completely owned on battle.net which was my experience when I was 10 (my opponent would laugh uncontrollably at the sight of my meager base and units)

7285	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	To say the least, Donkey Kong took everything this genre stood for, and made a muck-up of it. Endless item collecting, muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps, uh, chumps.
However there is one factor that seperates this from most games.  The secret to why this one of he best is that it is one of the few games that can touch you emotionally.  Any game can give you an adrenaline rush.  However it is very select few gaems that can touch you emotionally, and even make you cry.  Final Fantasy 7 has accomplished this.  THis is one of the select few titles that has ever done this.  To date the only other title to do this is the cult hit Ico.

Worth the investment.
Also, Super Smash Bros. doesn't get boring after you beat it. I've had the game for about three, four years and I still love it. And if you get this AWESOME multiplayer combat game hopefully you will too.
  Although the game gets a point taken off for not making the cities very detailed it is a lot more fun to play than it looks.

The Link character was really cool!  Link wears white tights, a green toga, and had a grappling hook device! He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around! You begin the game playing Link's little kid brother, which kinda sucked.  I can't pwn Goombas with a little midget (Goombas are these big skeleton guys).  I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan, after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland (maybe they have another game about that part).

Go wherever you want, do whatever you want
The gameplay itself is ludicrous. As you (moon)walk across the various levels (some generic, some inspired by his 'classic' music videos) you'll encounter baddies like gangsters and zombies and your amazing way of killing them is...dancing them do death. Seriously! It's not Jesus Juice, it's Jacko Jamming! You hit the special attack button and Jacko will suddenly yell 'OW!' before strutting his lethal stuff. After which, the baddies will be vanquished somehow. After playing this game you'll be exhilarated and mentally exhausted at Jacko's killer moves. You'll be reduced to a dribbling wreck. He's so good, that even passing-by animals will join in and shake their asses. If you ever wanted to play a game in which even an innocent dog is hypnotised by Jacko into dancing Thriller then this is for you. But I don't want to know you.
But then it became really really hard, tedious, you cannot save in the middle of a level so you have to play the damned level again and again and again.
1183	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I was never a big fan of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, but after giving Half-Life a try (thanks to all of the glimmering reviews), I am absolutely hooked. From the opening tram sequence, you're mesmerized by  Gordon Freeman's plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him.  It's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of  sunlight (apologies to my wife!). After dishing out punishment to those  Marines, be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes.  The fun gets even better, and the taste of death is even sweeter when you  blow apart that guy with 196 kills. Half-Life is truly a work of art.  Opposing Forces, here I come.
Dislike:
I've still to play as Knuckles and use the lock-on technology. But no matter how much I play or how hard I try there's no way I'll be able to get through the ENTIRE game and grab all 14 Chaos Emeralds. The Emerald stages are just too hard. With all 14 Chaos Emeralds you transform into Hyper Sonic, which I have never seen. But, to be honest I think there are only about 5 people in the history of the world who have been able to unlock Hyper Sonic.
Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game.


Super Metroid...
One of the major hurtles for this game is  learning the materia system. The instruction book isn't as clear as it  could be on how it works. Your best bet to understanding it is either  listen to what the people in the game tell you about materia or, even  better, mess around with it. I learned most of the tricks to materia by  going into battle, using my materia, and then changing it and finding  another battle. This not only helps you learn how the materia works but  gives you experience as well.
3708	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I played this game shortly after high school, and was very immersed in it.  In fact, I could not stop playing until I had finished it.  The music is wonderful, and the graphics are good for what they represent.  Character interaction is very detailed, with your choices affecting the game's ending.  Battle is fun, and the storyline is worthwhile.  I am aware they have made a remake, but I am more interested in replaying the genuine article!

For you parents, most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few "choice" phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids. For those of you that don't have to worry about that, order a pizza, call over a few friends and throw on some South Park multiplayer. Have fun!
9900	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I like this second version of Golden Axe for Sega Genesis.  A lot of action and good gameplay.  Thanks very much.
Right now, in 2012, if you're collecting N64 games for nostalgia's sake or for whatever , I'd say one of the console's Blitz games is a good and necessary investment. They're definitely "core" N64 games.. whatever that means. However, it's not the kind of football game you can really sit down and enjoy too too much by yourself. It's a lot of fun to just knock the daylights out of your friends in Blitz. But alas, the AI just can't provide the kind of reaction that makes it entertaining.
On the other hand, the visuals and music are amazing. The sprites are beautifully unique from all of the other games, comparable to a cartoon, or a picture book. The new Super FX chip is great, as well. Just watch a video of the title screen. It's fantastic.
As usual, weird stuff is happening around South Park like mad, killer turkeys are attacking the city, strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest 8 year olds on the planet Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman on this strange, vulger and very gratuitous journey.
2484	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move, Fox McCloud can shoot his laser, Link can throw boomerangs and bombs, while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick, but they all throw, smash, pound, pummle, blast and burn diffrently. Also, items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs, (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords, hammers, Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option, this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game, you'll fall in love with it fast.
Where am I going with this, you ask? Well, I have probably played more racing games in my life than any other kind of game. I have played pretty much every kind of racing game in existance, from Gran turismo and Rage racer on Playstation to Hydro Thunder and Star Wars Episode 1:Pod Racer on Dreamcast, fron Diddy Kong on N64 to F-Zero and Mario Kart on Super Nintendo. And I am here to tell you that this one of the best racing games ever made, not just on Playstation, but on any system.

In this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes.

As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.
9123	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Space Invaders certainly is a fun arcade classic (To think it came all the way from the late 70s), and it clearly shows that through its simplistic, yet enjoyable gameplay. A 2-Player Vs Mode to see who can kill the aliens faster is a nice addition to the faithful adaptation.

I would buy this !...... an well I have :)
One of the best features is that the  monsters aren't "typical" sword 'n sorcery fare. In other words,  don't come looking for orcs, goblins, giants, etc. While the bestiary of AC  obviously derives from these fantasy fiction archetypes, it develops them  differently, adding to the strong sense that one is truly in an  "unknown world."

Pokemon Red sold 4.83 million in the United States, so this qualifies as an underrated game, due to selling under 5 million units. If you want to buy the best Game Boy game ever, this is where you will find it. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS! This should have gotten a "Game Of The Year" reward or two, but this (near) perfect masterpiece NEVER got it. A true Pokemon fan has this gem in his/her collection. However, one thing. Some of these might be worn out (discolored label, multiple scratches on the back, etc.) due to being so great of a game. Don't say I didn't warn you.

1645	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Namco Museum 3 (third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits) hits some high and low spots, but is well worth the purchase price for three games.  The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original.  Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original.  Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults.  I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition.  On the other hand, "Phozon" and "Tower of Druga" are very forgettable, "Tower" the most worthless of the lot.  Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man.
Alright, this game was somewhat of a game changer both for video games, and myself.

The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use.
The game's pacing is good. So far, it has yet to become bogged down by some stupid plot point. The game makes you want to see what the next level holds in store.
Heavily scarred and  tattooed, your character, the Nameless One, awakes on a mortuary slab and  the first sound you hear is the smart mouthed floating skull, Morte, the  first of your companions on of your journey.  Morte is a floating  repository of knowledge, which is just as well since it turns out you've  died, come back to life and lost your memory ... again.  When Morte  translates the tattoos on your back, you get the first clues about the  cycle of life and death you've become trapped in.  In your search as an  amnesiac immortal to find out what's been happening to you and who is  behind it all, you get to explore and meet many of the strange denizens of  the Planes, performing quests in return for knowledge.  Some of those who  know the most about your past consent to join you - it would be great if  the party size could accommodate all of them.
Eight special weapons are readily available and there's something for every taste, from the heat-seeking Wasp ("You can run, but you can't hide!") to the lightsaber-like Blade ("I don't need no Force to kick your sorry butt!") to the no-nonsense, wallop-packing Cannon ("JUST DIE!!!!").  Plus, there are four others (each a sort of variation on one of the ubiquitous eight) hidden throughout the game.
The gameplay is just plain amazing.  It's a simple way of playing: move, perform an action, and choose the direction you face.  It's also complex enough to require a well thought strategy, thus where the word "Tactics" comes into play.  Random battles are actually random; they don't have a specific pattern, compared to other Final Fantasy games.  Also, there's a deep class system called the "Job System".  This is a legendary component of one of the Final Fantasy games, FFV.  You can customize each member of your party to your style of play, and at the beginning of each battle, you are allowed to place up to 5 members in a specific place.  You also have guest members which stay in your party until you get to a certain part of the game.  Most of these guests can become permenant members of your party, which is actually good since there's one character that you can get that's really worth getting.  There's also side-quests that allow you to get hidden characters, including Cloud Strife from FFVII.
3747	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess.

Overall, a great game with lots of RPGing.  Five stars and more. You will love.
Having been playing alot of Desktop Tower Defense games lately, I thought I would upgrade to a true RTS game.  Starcraft kept coming up high on everyone's favorite list, so I thought I'd give it a try.
The only people you will actually interact with at all in the game are the aforementioned Altus, Sirrus, and Achernar.  This leads me to my one and only complaint about the game.  I wish the Millers had spent a little more money to hire some better actors to play these roles, as all three of them are badly overacted.  But, that's a minor gripe.  Altus' acting is so bad, it's actually funny.
I'm trying to remember the almost mystical sensation I got as a child first playing this, a light-year-leaping paradigm-shifting moment of complete perfection, the first of the SNES batch.  I can almost remember the contours of the feeling, but I can't live it again: it's hallowed.  That's fine--the child knew it at least.
Missions are very fun to play
Gameplay: Addicting to say the least. Having trouble putting down the controller until you can leave Midgar? No one is judging you here. The game mechanics are flawless in what they provide in terms of gameplay. Sure, you could always add more, but why fix what isn't broken in this masterpiece? Grinding might seem a little annoying, but it's not about leveling your character up to be twice as strong as the end level boss. The battles are all about strategy, which is understandable why many don't comprehend that. You level up your character, level up materia, swap items, prepare accessories and weapons, earn proper amounts of gil from battles, sell mastered materia, find stronger weapons and armor, mingle with townsfolk, decide how you want to treat an ally, breed and race Chocobos, go on mini side quests, partake in a few hilarious main quests, and all of it feels rewarding. The replayability is on high for this because you can always go back and make different choices in another playthrough, or just relive the story and imagination. One disc wasn't enough to pack such massive gameplay as it required a full three for the mighty Playstation hardware. Don't think you have beaten the game if you haven't beaten Emerald or Ruby WEAPON either. It doesn't end with just Sephiroth.
Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.
Cartoonish graphics are a bit dated.

The graphics are dated, but that isn't where the fun is.  For me it is the fast paced-ness of the game that keeps me hooked.  Unlike most RTSs I have played, each misson doesn't have to take an hour and a half to complete.  If you know how to build, it can take you 5 minutes to defeat a game aginst a single computer opponent.  You can also build crazily, and go like that, or you can develop a strategy and either way, you stand a chance of winning.

Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........
The bosses aren't that difficult, the only bosses that ever given me problem are Bowser (of course) and the 5 (4?) dinosaurs that stands on some wooden thingies.
What more is there to say? This game proves that all good sequels are made like this. The game simply builds MASSIVELY upon what its predecessor had to offer, which to me was nothing more than introducing the franchise. There is much more to do, enjoy, and look forward to - which is the primary foundation for any good sequel. Any negatives this game may have do not come to mind which is why I haven't mentioned them. Even so, they most likely would be trivial anyway. Needless to say this is a must have for any Kirby fan, and anyone looking to get their retro gaming fix.

5880	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Good gravy... This is the absolute worst game that I have ever played in my entire life. Not that the game was even that bad, but... It never lived up to its own hype. I have played all of the Final Fantasy games... Since I beat the very first game, I have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic. I cherished IV, and I absolutely LOVE VI, which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music. And Final Fantasy VII blew my mind... The Final Fantasy... In a whole different perspective, with three dimensions on the battlefield. When FFVIII came out, I already had a copy reserved... I held the glowing package in my hands, looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics, and in my head I could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to. But as my best friend and I put the disk in and beheld Final Fantasy VIII... There was a voice screaming in my head... My mind kept saying something to me over and over again as I walked through Balamb Garden... And then my friend said that very thought: "Jay, this game sucks." Yes, it does. This game is a disgrace to the series. A storyline that is so slow, so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences? There was no Final Fantasy VIII Theme! The battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the FFVII Score. There was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey. The disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the CG movies. The character development was never there. Never did we ever find out why Seifer was such a jerk. ...Or WHY the GFs (Ha, ha) erased the memories of the characters. The lead character, Squall, answered every single question with the word "whatever." Compare that to the strong-willed, heartbroken Cloud from FFVII, and it becomes obvious. Allow me to say one more thing: Final Fantasy VI gripped me. I captivated me with a spell that bound me. I played, played, and played that silly game, with it's cute 16 bit graphics, as if I were possessed. The same goes for VII. I wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment. I got as far as the mission to Timber in FFVIII, and never gave it a second glance. Only a year later, after exams were done in college, with no car or friends around... Did I pull Final Fantasy VIII out again to give it a second chance. How sad. The only time I ever cried over a video game was when Aeris died in Cloud's arms... But when I first played Final Fantasy VIII, I know that I wanted to just bawl.
Blizzard has a different philosophy than most gaming companies. They continue to work on a game until they believe it is a first class product. They provide added value like a game editor that you can use to create better missions than the professional ones created in the game.  Not to mention, the server network Battle Net, that allows game owners with simple Internet connections to login, and play online with up to 8 players, for no additional charge!  Yes that's right Ultima and Everquest players, it's still totally free to play online!

Now we have Delta Force 2 ... and nothing much has changed.  Some new  weapons, new maps, and new single player missions.  Unfortunately, the  graphics are more demanding, causing slowdowns on many machines.  If you  have a 32-bit 3D card, you're lucky - those are the only ones the game  accepts as of now. All in all, this is still a great game with the best  online action around - I recommend it!
R4 is an arcade racer, so people who prefer sim games (or who >>think<< they do) may not like it.  However, as a car nut myself with all these racing games, sometimes having less realism and more fantastic cars is the best gaming medicine.

Overall, Star Ocean 2 brings best of new and old-school RPG.  I just can't wait to play Star Ocean 3, and hope to see Blue Sphere in US.  (I reset the machine many times just to listen the opening theme)
The graphics are dated now, obviously, but back in 1998 we've never SEEN anything like this before. Outside on the streets is nighttime, and the lights in the police station are dim and just as scary and fitting. It's hard to believe how real the atmosphere is. The only negative is that the music isn't quite as good as you've probably read. Neither are the sound effects (except for the sounds those lickers make). Silent Hill has the game beat in this area.
My only complaint is that the box comes full. I have other guides and Zelda books like the historia book that I can't cram inside it with the others, but that's ok. They need to sell the chest on it's own as I could fill another chest with the Zelda guides I already have.

The Saturn version has a couple things that the Playstation version doesn't have, so don't worry Saturn fans!  Exclusive to the Saturn version includes an extra move for the Undertaker (in this version, you can deliver multiple chokeslams to your opponent - you can't do this on the Playstation version) and plus the Saturn version was created so you can perform finishing moves whenever you want, whereas in the Playstation version they can only be delivered during one-on-one matches.  It doesn't matter how many people you are facing on the Saturn version, you can deliver finishing moves at the end of every match, if you'd like.
One other aspect of "Super Mario 64" that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.  It delivered magnificently then and, with its continual replay value, still delivers today.

4751	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Quite simply this is quite possibly the best game ever made, period. By taking the standard formula which Super Metroid perfected on the Super Nintendo, of finding items and opening up new areas, Castlevania Symphony of the Night excels on every level to combine and create the most significant game accomplishment, in my opinion ever made. By using the standard side scrolling elements of the classic games from the 8 bit days and combining them with some of the lushest and most breathtaking visuals and special effects, the hand drawn effect that this game creates rivals almost any game on the original Playststion. The music is etheral accomplishment and ranks at the top of my best soundtracks for a game ever, joining the ranks of Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and Silent Hill 2 as some of the most noticeable and well done music to ever pass through the gaming world. The music combines orchestra type composure in a rock opera vibe that fits every single enviroment so well that you will never dread entering any area, in fact you wil even find yourself backtracking to previous areas just to hear this music again (By the way I own the soundtrack, thats how damn good this games music is.) The gameplay is some of the best ever in a game, incorporating all the classic elements of the Castlevania series, and combining them with experience and equipping items from Role Playing Games to form a natural bond that still makes me wonder why more developers have not tried to make a game like this (probably due to the fact that few could accomplish what Konami has done with this game). The only weak part of this game is the voice acting which literally sucks (pun intended) it seems like they picked people who were overly ambitious in their voice acting skills, and I'm sure the dialogue was bad because of the Japanes to English translation when it was brought stateside. Beyond that though if you buy this game I can guarantee you will not be dissappointed. Every boss fight, every encounter, everything about this game pushes it leaps and bounds ahead of the competion. No 3dimensional game I have ever played can crete the sheer passion and joy of controlling Alucard; his movements and actions are graceful and even just picking up the HP max ups is a chilling experience. This game cannot be missed, and I guarantee that I will still play this game when I am like 50 years old and wondering what in the hell happenned to the artistry and pure skill that a two dimensional "old-school" game can pull off and achieve so well.

As Alucard, you fight Dracula's evil minions while exploring the castle and the ground upon which it sits. The castle itself is made up of main halls, a church, a bell tower, a courtyard, and a library, among other things. Under ground are the abandoned mine and the catacombs. Things get even more interesting when or if you get to an upside-down version of the castle, where you face an evil grim reaper in earth "above" the castle, and eventually Vlad himself.

The puzzles in GK3 are generally a mix of standard inventory-based, timed activity, and arcade.  Often you have to wander around a lot to figure out what you need to do next.  One particular puzzle stands out as one of the best thought-out and most complex puzzles I've ever come across in gaming.  In it you must solve a riddle by analyzing and linking various inventory items.  It's a very long puzzle and some people might find it frustrating, but it was the thing that really caught and held my interest. If all I have to do is talk to people and find inventory items, I don't feel like I've really done anything. There's plenty of that in GK3, but you also have to stretch your brain.

My oh my. The championship mode on this game has got to be one the greatest racing experiences that can be had on a game console. You have two view modes, both of them PERFECT. You have car customization, but not the boring, confusing, time wasting sort that has become common nowadays. You have SEGA arcade-style music, which I happen to love. You fantastic slip-and-slide physics which make controling the cars a blast. You have TONS of different variations on the race tracks (every one of them a perfect example of AWESOME track design). And lastly, you have some of the most beautiful graphics in any racing game ever. Honestly, the first time I raced a track at sunset, I was OVERJOYED that I didn't get rid of this game when I considered doing it. The most beautiful graphics in any racing game can (in my humble opinion) be found in the original Wipeout, and this game.

2819	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Clearly one of the most innovative and fun platformers of its time. This game introduced the DUALSHOCK analog controls for the original PlayStation. It offered much more control in a 3D space than anything else at the time. Plus, you get all these amazing gadgets to catch monkeys! The monkeys have obtained these helmets that cause them to act out in ways not normal for primates. Its your mission to utilize your skills and gadgets to get them all back to the lab to restore order to the world. The core gameplay is surprisingly fun and you use the gadgets directionally with the right analog stick. This makes the method to catching each monkey unique. It also featured an awesome unlock system if you explored the game world enough and found the Specter coins. You could use the coins to buy mini games to play when you're tired of looking for them darn monkeys. The voice acting isn't perfect, but what PS1 games touted the most amazing voice acting you've ever heard? The graphics are very good for the PlayStation, very colorful and bright with a surprising amount of detail gone into all the different levels with varying themes. This game was created by none other than the legendary Sony Japan Studio behind so many other unique and iconic games. It had direct involvement with Shuhei Yoshida himself! This is truly a classic in the PlayStation library that should be experienced by anyone who considers themselves a fan of platformer/action/adventure games. It's a shame this series doesn't get the recognition it deserves today.

The game has spawned countless websites, fan-clubs, mutli-player tournaments, championships, novels, DVDs, action figures...you name it, and Starcraft has been there at one point in time or the other...and it has reigned supreme. Good, even Great games come and go, but Starcraft is the one RTS game that you will forever remember.

I'll look up those cut parts up later, which I'm pretty sure had absolutely no impact on the story anyway but it would be nice to see everything as intended.

4241	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I have to admit that my copy of Gabriel Knight 3 sat on my shelf for over a year before I felt like playing it all the way through.  This was because I did not like the 3-D graphics this time around; after all, some of the "movies" on Gabriel Knight 2 were superb and you just can't get that with 3-D.  I still don't like the 3-D graphics, but once I started playing this game seriously I was hooked again.  The historical background stuff is always fascinating to me and any game in which a tube of Preparation H plays a part is always going to impress me.  I hate to think what sort of individual could play this game without resorting to hints and cheats, although they would have to be somebody with a lot more time on their hands than I am.  There is always some point where I need some help finding out what I missed out on that prevents me from advancing to the next time block (I didn't pick up the glass in the hallway and now I can't listen in on conversations going on in the rooms.  Sigh).  I like Tim Curry as much as the next person, but it doesn't sound like him so his return is not a big deal for me (I liked the guy in GK2).  What's more important here is the wry sense of humor: Can't get somebody to talk?  Try the gun icon, see what happens.  I have to assume most people who play "Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" come to the game through one if not both of the first two Gabriel Knight adventures.  In that case I certainly do not think you will be more than mildly disappointed with episode 3.
  Then, I got the PS2 and the MadCatz MC2 steering wheel. The wheel will NOT work with GT3. Among other things, GT3 has limited camera angles and just a few of the cars that THIS game has.

Starcraft and the expansion Broodwar, still generate a daily complement of 40000 players, online at any one time, playing in thousands of games. I'm sure the newest games like Warcraft III, and Diablo II is providing the lions share of overall traffic on Blizzards server farms.  Still, Starcraft is a game going on six years of relatively strong viability. The reasons why are simple.

Two games were released along with the system. There was Pilotwings 64, which was not exactly what was expected, but the other game was called the greatest game of all time (as of 1996, that is, at least in the eyes of critics) by several source. And it really was.
The framerate is so slow and choppy I just decided that, after walking into a wall for the millionth time, it was time to put this game in the trash.  When you walk into a wall, Duke stops moving completely and just stands there like an idiot.  You will walk into a wall ALL the time because it's so hard controlling Duke.  Some people might put this game is the garbage because of the bad example it sets for kids, but others (like me) threw it away because a challenge should NEVER lie in just trying to move your character from point A to point B.  Please, avoid this horrible waste of plastic.
Sega done well with the Dreamcast because they did the opposite of Sega Saturn when it comes to games. The games are diverse and range to platform games to 2d/3d fighters and action adventures and most of them are still are not bad and look similar to a PS2 game. I think Sega was targeting people with this system that wanted arcade style games while Sony did the same,but with a dvd player. In 2002 Sega stop making systems after the PS2 out sold the Dreamcast at sales,but now it is just a software company instead which I am glad they are still around. I recently bought a Hori PS2 joystick and used a PS adapter and it's way more fun than using the DC controller. I would highly advise everyone that doesn't already have the DC arcade stick to get an Hori arcade joystick or X-Arcade stick and a PS adapter to get to the whole arcade feel. The DC system has mostly arcade fighting games,so people that don't like this system probably don't like fighting games.
It's nothing major usually, such as a minor typo or grammatical error in the script.
All in all, the story line is really great, and the cliff-hanger ending has left me waiting for the next release. Enjoy!

The game interface is very intuitive  and easy-to-learn. With a simple click of the mouse, you go from pleasant  chat to battle mode. Choose hand-to-hand combat, ranged weapons, or cast  magic.
-Bad and poorly thought-out voice-acting (Listen to X's voice!)
The game is relatively  easy, but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and  over again.

So many great things to say about this game but there is one flaw that made me give it 4.5 stars...the graphics get crazy ass choppy when there is a lot of action going on. This is especially true when you have 4 human players and 8 bots playing in the same match or when you get punched in the face as the screen gets blurry to mimic your vision after it happens to you in real life. If you don't have it and you love FPSs, get this game and be sure to have the expansion pack or you won't get to play everything. ********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********
7203	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	One of the best PS1 games ever. So simple yet so difficult and frustrating. I almost prefer this one over the first Oddworld. Definitely a game worth checking out if you are a PS1 fan. The story is engrossing, the gameplay is spot on, and the cutscenes are awesome. I'm always astounded looking back at how good the graphics were for PS1 games during cutscenes.
I also get a tired of too much repitition. Every battle I  set my formation up, pause, issue relatively the same commands, and  execute. (In Everquest, I only went up to Level 12 and quit, thinking,  what's the point?) So the combat is repetitive, but in Baldur's defense, it  does have a storyline and an ending, unlike Everquest. But it is time  consuming. But if you can afford the time, and you like RPG's, then you'll  love this title, otherwise, spend your gaming money elsewhere.

Play control is great, classic overhead view like LOZ NES and LOZ ALTTP SNES game.  Pretty nice challenge not a cakewalk.  Nice dungeon layouts and puzzles.  The game has a lot of characters and monsters also seen in ALTTP but plenty of new and refreshing new bosses and enemies/allies as well.  There is not a lot to say that has not already been said.  I did think finding all the seashells was kind of annoying after awhile it would have been cool to get a different prize and get the sword upgrade by beating another boss somewhere on the map.  But overall the game has a nice story and the creators really did a nice job on the game.  The game is definitely 5 stars and worth your time playing whether in black and while or not it doesn't matter.  They don't make em like they used to.

Overall, this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s.  For those who are too young to remember Atari, the game is nice to play because of its retro and anything retro is cool.

There are two ways to to do this, you must pick Mario as your character and you must go to Hyrule Castle as a stage (you can fight any opponent you want). At Hyrule Castle, get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform, and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side. Then, spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform. From here, go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side, facing left. Do Mario's Up + B move - if done correctly, your opponent's percentage will go up to 999%. Then, simply wait a second, and knock your opponent off the screen. The other way that takes longer, but is easier. Just select any chracter that shoots projectiles, like mario, luigi, and fox then keep hurting your opponent at the practice level of any selection until they get 999% and after hit the opponent and see them fly like a missle.

The Bad: Feels nothing compared to today's GT games, doesn't have as much content as most racers these days, due to its age it doesn't feel like a racing simulator anymore, no car damage
It starts off as your average civ-building game with the five crashed faction colonies setting up separately.  As one of the faction leaders, you have particular bonuses.  You start off with a town, a couple technologies, and you're off and running trying to build up your tech tree, economy, military, and lots of cities.

6685	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love Pokmon, Links Awaking, and Super Mario Land 2. But this is my personal favorite Original Gameboy game. When it came out it blew people's minds and it still does to me. People may have their opinions but this has to be on any gameboy system! But it has aged no save, and no color are the big ones. It is weird Mario game with no Bowser, Peach, or even Luigi. There are only 4 worlds but they're hard! Everybody should at least try. Me: 5+/5 For Everyone: 4.6+/5

Your animals buddies also increase, with the help of a springy snake and a web-making spider. Squawks, Rambi, and Enguarde also come back, better than ever!

But we still have our memories and even better, many of us still have our Dreamcasts. A true testament to a console and games of the past is how well they hold up today. Many times, your memory serves you better than reality. I've experienced that many times with old games I used to like. But many of these are still alot of fun. Maybe not as much as they were at first but they can still provide a good time.
CONS:
The game takes time and is recommended for those that can devote 30min-1hour a day to the game.
3203	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake! The game looks great and sounds great, but its too easy. The game that is supposed to be the game for "die hard fighting fans" is basically a walk in the park. The game is a button masher! I played the game and found that "turtling up" and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.
What Capcom should have done is to make a new version for the PS3, however, they did not, so the original will have to suffice...the graphics are poor by today's standards, but top-notch by 1997 standards.  The fun factor and classicness of this game more than makes up for that shortcoming...as any serious gamer such as myself does not rate the graphics of a classic game by modern standards.
i get lots of laughs when watching someone plays the haunted house
Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode, Super Mario 64 is really super!
Uh. Ahh. Eeek. The first problem with the pc version of Altered
All that said, I do love this game, but it's not easily playable. It brings solid graphics to the GameBoy, but the gameplay...if it is solid, perhaps we would better say that you'll need a jackhammer to scratch the surface of this particular rock.

6625	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love games that make me think but don't require me to do a lot of little steps and remember a lot of details; I'll take an other college class for that.  This game is constantly changing and you can plan out the big things yet still need to make adjustments so it doesn't get dull.  That alliance you once had has been broken, not what do you do and still get to your next tech advance?  I've decide I prefer to be the Spartans even if the Gaians are more in line with my own political views -- the goal is to win afterall.
If you still own a working Genesis and don't have this game or haven't played this game before, I recommend looking for it.

Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.
4983	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Resident evil and other horror games for the Playstation have NO match for this. This game has a very creepy vibe and keeps you questioning where you're going and what's around the corner. I'm not easily scared either. The story line is amazing! And the voice actors did a great job. Silent hill is a classic for this system, and I'm glad I bought it. If you have a dualshock controller, Harry's heartbeat is vibrated off the controller. It's amazing!!
The soundtrack is even better than that in the first game, and Masato Nakamura returns to create music in this game as well.  Aside from having more levels and therefore more music tracks, a good deal of the music on here is better than in the first game (which still has great music).  Standout tracks on here are for Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, Metropolis, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg (though for Death Egg, you only hear about four seconds of the music since you immediately go into one of the last boss battles).  Death Egg is the perfect music to hear when you're in a high-tech spacecraft.  Mystic Cave is worth mentioning because the opening melody is really reminiscent of the Inspector Gadget theme, and that the music itself is pretty creepy.  Casino Night and Sky Chase have really relaxed, upbeat feelings to them.

7476	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	When Yoshi's Story came out, I was stoked thinking it was a 64-bit sequel to Yoshi's Island. I was SO WRONG. This game is aimed at 5-10 year old gamers. You go around "Chapters" collecting fruit in the levels to advance, thus levels have no actual exit. There's 4 areas in each chapter. 6 chapters calls for 24 total levels in the game. To make this game even more disappointing, when you finish one level (say 1-1), you'd think you go to 1-2, but no. Instead you go to Chapter 2. What the heck?! It turns out you have to find red hearts hidden in each level to unlock a level in the next chapter. To unlock all of Chapter 1's level you have to complete one level, die, then go back. It's a stupid setup. I was really hoping for a Yoshi's Island 2 type game here but this is Nintendo cashing in on their child fanbase. Basically, if you're older than 10, this game will be too childish for your liking.

The plot is weaved strongly through the course of the game. Many of your allies are found dead throughout the mission, consumed by the horrors of the mansion. Others are as desperate as ever to get out, while some are a bit too satisfied hanging around. The plot is advanced mostly through cut-scenes where characters interact with each other. The voices, as all know, are pretty hilarious (or bad, depending on your perspective). For the time, characters using voice-overs as opposed to text was revolutionary. Unfortunately, the voice acting didn't stand the test of time, and some of the more hilarious quips are almost inside-jokes among video game fans.
7068	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game rocks!! I always liked bomberman but this game is the bomb! The levels are fun and provides hours of gameplay. The other thing is that the multiplayer rules!! You can battle with up to four of your friends. If you want a great game by a copy of this game now.

Really one of the best games I've ever played, and definitely the best PS1 game as far as entertainment value goes. I wish that Phil Hartman had lived to be the voice of Captain Blasto in a sequel! Did I mention the mazes being difficult? They'll have you pulling your hair out. It all takes place in a cartoonish universe full of tongue-in-cheek humor and obscure science fiction movie references. Or inferences. GREAT FUN!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
I hope the PC version gets re-released some day. Or maybe i'll just get a PS version Rom, because MK trilogy is the best MK game ever... just not on the 64.
At the start of the game, you are allowed to choose a difficulty (more difficulties unlock with harder settings being beaten), select the amount of players you start with and choose your hero. There is up to 4 different characters to chose from. Alex (My Favorite and also on the Original SOR) has some devastating attacks, and is fairly agile. Blaze (also from Original SOR) is the definition of balanced, with average attack and agility. The game does bring 2 newcomers to the fray. Skate (names different depending on region), who is Adam's brother, is VERY fast and capable of doing some decent damage with his skates. Alex's friend Max is the last of the new characters. He is a professional wrestler who does the most damage in the game, but also has the slowest speed.
THE GOOD:

If this game came out in 2001, I think it would still be worthy on five stars.  Consider when it DID come out, and ask yourself how you missed out on this one.
Soon now I must buy Mass Effect 3. I have no choice, for Greg and Ray (like Scylla and Charybdis) are calling my name.
- Non- traditional fighting gameplay, might alienate some more traditional fighting game fans
One the map...this game takes place north of the NCR area (Shady sands in fallout).  If you yearn for a wonderful game where you can shoot humans, ghouls, sleep with a crim bosses daughter, or just shoot up some jet with 'lil jesus in New Reno (or perhaps tour the wonderful Golgotha cemetery, where people are either impaled on sticks or strung out for the birds), then pick up this game!  Although you may want to play Fallout first...to get the full effect.  I am awaiting Fallout III!!!!!!!!!!!!
The music, story and backgrounds are blended supurbly.  This is truly an impressive production, but, like I say, I had my own personal misgivings of what I wanted.  Still, my personal tastes shouldn't detract from what surely is quality game design.
CONS
The game is extremely simple to learn, yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master.  You will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponents.

2312	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	For me, this game is just about as fun as Sonic Adventure 2. It will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wanna beat the game with all 4 storylines. And, who doesn't? The controls, for the most part, are pretty good. Although, there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and you'll swing yourself right off a cliff and die. That will happen more than once to you.

5638	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Quake 3 is completely different than the first two Quake and Doom games. This game is really more Multiplayer based, although I'd rather play alone, since most people who play it online do nothing but write filthy words and insults instead of playing. But I find myself liking this game better than the new Quake 4. This one happens to contain several very fun mini games, like Capture the Flag, Team Arena (Must buy expansion from store), and Team Deathmatch, in which you're on a team of gladiators, all with the same color uniform.

- There is a version for the P.C. as well
1244	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Let me tell you all about this great game. I wouldn't want to give the story away, but let me tell you: The original two are no match for this great game! This game has 30 new colorful and nice levels, and 2 hidden ones. Almost all of them have nice and pretty graphics. There are more features too. For one thing, there is the Time Trial mode, in which you go through the levels in a certain amount of time, and you will get relics. You can play as Coco, riding her adorable tiger Pura, a jetski, a blimp, and a couple more. Crash himself can do some more things, like a Super Belly Flop, a Double Jump, a Triple Spin, use Speed Shoes and use a Fruit Bazooka for long range attacks. Also, he can ride an airplane, a motorcycle, a baby T-Rex and more. Also, even dying is humorous. Now for the game's one flaw: It is hard to be challenged. However, there are 3 types of relics. If you get all of the Sapphire Relics, you can get a really good ending. If you get all the Gold Relics, you get 105%. But the Platinum Relics require a master to collect. So, if you like all that's said, and even if you didn't, you will definitely love it.
More Multiplayer! You can  also play the game (single player missions) against a friend! Yes, it's  true. You're friend plays as an enemy, and when killed re-spawns as another  enemy opponent, until the level is completed or until Joanna Dark is dead.

Gameplay: There are three different gameplay modes.  First, there is the campaign, which includes several mission in which you snuff out the lairs of heroes and rival keepers on your way to dominating the region.  Typically, you build a base by tunneling out rooms and finding gold, attract a legion of monster henchmen while doing so, and then take on the forces of your rival.  There is enough variation in the missions to prevent boredom, although there are a few very tough missions (especially the last two).  There is also a skirmish mode that lets you fight against 1-3 rival keepers while fighting off other interlopers. The skirmish game can be customized in various ways, although there are only about 20 maps.  Finally, there is a "my pet dungeon" mode for those who just want to build their subterranean masterpieces without being troubled by opposition (although you can choose to include set-piece battles against heroes). All of the gameplay modes have their appeal, though I liked the campaign and skirmish the best.  The game can be played online, but I suspect there is not much of a multiplayer community these days.
The game CHEATS.
If you're a true Mega Man fan, then you know what I'm talking about as far as playing this great game. It was a refreshing new spin on the Mega Man franchise and gamers everywhere loved it. For those who haven't tried it yet, you absolutely must if you have any interest in playing classic Mega Man titles. You can track down a used copy for your SNES, search for a used copy of the Mega Man X Anniversary Collection for PS2 or Gamecube, or download this title for the Wii via the Virtual Console Service for 800 points ($8.00.) Either way, it is worth it and a true classic game that belongs in anyone's game collection. I highly recommend you check it out.
Nintendo's GameBoy Color has a wide selection on games. Super Mario Bros Deluxe is one I highly recommend. Pokemon Gold and Silver are also really good. Donkey Kong Country and Mega Man is also not bad. Plus,Nintendo's GameBoy Color can play Nintendo GameBoy games too. They can also use the link cable to connect to each other.

The story follows a Crusauder named Christof as he deals with becoming a vampire and searching for his lost love Anestka. With a few twist thrown in, including one extreme one. The story is solid but half way through I was wishing for a more complicated plot than just finding Anesca.  I was impressed with how the designers incorporated the history and clan relationships from the Vamp Masquerade RPG. Although it does seem unlikely that in a city the size of say Praque their would be around a hundred Vampires.
In summary, if you're a fan of turn based strategy games, then you should get many enjoyable hours out of this game, even if it doesn't really introduce anything new to the genre.

In  addition, each countries forces and militaries are also seperated from  eachother, making the whole experince very real.

The thing about this game that is especially addictive is the monument building.  What other game can you build pyramids with?  That alone is worth picking up this title.  This game would have received 5 stars from me, but the fighting parts of this game are cumbersome.  The troops move so slowly and heaven help you if you have to move your troops across rivers with the "transports."  Still a good game, but very addictive so watch out or you will be spending a lot of time in front of your computer, which for some of you is your life anyway....  B+
1) Great graphics
Gameplay? Amazing. You'll get use to the layout of the controls very quickly. Soon, you'll be quick reloding and popping around corners like a pro. You can shimmy walls, knock on them to distract guards, come up behind a guard and choke them until they pass out or just snap their neck. What about A.I? It isn't terrible. On Easy it's a joke. However the guards can see your footprints in the snow, and track you. They can also hear your footsteps on certain kind of terrain, and when they group up it can be scary.

You can also pick from 3 2-player modes. The Mariokart GP is the same as in 1 player with 2 players. Match mode is a 1 versus 1 race between two human players. Battle mode is where the two players go throughout the track, throwing items at eachother to try and pop the opponents' ballons. The racing is action-packed and still very fun in 2016.

Taken as a whole, TNT Evilution is an excellent and balanced expansion that just can't make its case with the eleven levels presented here. It could have been better with a better selection of levels, but it's just better to buy a copy of the Doom Collector's Edition for the PC and play it in its entirety. Additionally, while I have nothing against the ambient score whipped up for the PlayStation versions of Doom, I just don't have patience towards it when reflecting back on the wonderful midi-based soundtrack Team TNT created for the PC original.
6838	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I got Sonic the Hedgehog 2 back in the day around the early 90's,actually it's my first video game to play. This game is so fun and easy to play,I always thought Sonic games have the best music,its so addictive. The levels are really fun and have different creative enemies. One thing about this game I didn't like is the boss(Dr. Robotnick) at the end is hard,the reason it was so hard is that I forgot how to beat him,and he was harder than the first game.
For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.
With that said, this game is poetry in motion.  From the music to the artwork, everything is simply a pleasure for the senses and when coupled with solid simplistic and fun gameplay you really can't argue.

The second half of the game is much quieter.  Entering the three actual ghost "worlds" is almost mundane and somewhat anticlimactic.  When things are spooky, it's more because you're experiencing the reality of a person who is himself creepy, than because the actual events are scary.  I found this both a disappointment and a relief, after the excitement of the initial half of the game.
Graphically, Max Payne features some truly amazing textures, very much photo-realistic.  Controlling Max will be simple for anyone who has played a FPS style game, with one great twist: "Bullet-Time" gameplay.  This is a feature where the player can slow down the game time, ala' "The Matrix," with a simple mouse button click.  This gives the player a small tactical advantge, but it certainly does not distract from the already difficult gameplay.

Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see, the first thing of note that comes to mind is the fact that enemies level up at the same rate as Squall.  That means that power-leveling is no longer desirable.  This might be disappointing to some, but I found it to be quite nice because the game isn't overly hard, and I didn't have to waste time power-leveling.  Another point of interest is that you eventually get a way to avoid random battles, which is awesome.  Another point is that there are plenty of mini-games and side-quests of sufficient variety available to enjoy (my favorite is the card game).  So, there should be plenty features here to please everyone.

2981	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Everyone complains how great or how bad this game was. To me when it first came out I loved it, it was the first Final Fantasy game I played i was like 9 or 10 years old. I still like the game a lot yes now it has bad graphics but they were cool back then. The story was good but at times made you laugh. Cloud was alright but there has been better but I thought sephiroth was a great bad guy and to me the best character in the game. Yes it is long but I enjoy games that take time to beat and it wasn't very difficult to beat. I enjoyed that there was a lot of extra stuff to do in the game besides the main storyline which is smoething games are missing these days.
8045	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Ok, I know this review is coming really late considering the game has been out so long, but when I read the other reviews.... First of all, the graphics. THEY ROCK. They are 2d, yes, and the people are small (chibi style is what they call it). But the small people rock. They look like cartoons. When battling every character looks different, you can equip different weapons besides the swordians, and each weapon looks different. What really bugs me is that some people say the graphics [are bad], yes mabye the terrains do, and mabye the outside world does, but the battles. Hundreds of animations for each character can describe it. There are so many different moves and spells for each character(well so many different spells for characters with swordians, ill explain that later). It is amazing that they have about 50 very different looking spells per character with a swordian, and about 20 different special techniques per character(which is alot once you play through the game). I have beaten the game, and yes, the terrains for the outside world may [be bad]. But each town looks different. Each dungeon is there for a reason, and not there to get a special bonus item. Trust me, the graphics for battles are awesome, and probably the best 2d graphics out there.

If you're a huge fan of this game's particular universe, and simply MUST know how the story goes, then Vampire: The Masquerade Redemption may be worth the effort. Just be prepared for the headaches.
There are many levels of difficulty, which is excellent.  Once you master one level or strategy, you can change the settings (and certain characteristics in the game, such as what type of terrain you get, which makes all the difference).  You must manage any one of thirteen civilizations, ranging from the Turks to the Vikings.  Each civilization has it's own unique benefits and drawbacks and their own style of buildings and armies.  You collect natural resources, advance through ages by meeting requirments in your stockpiles, create workers, explore, conquer, build an army, make allies, engage in trade and battle, and so much more!  The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a strategy game and always keep you involved with the game.

Graphically, Blast Corps does only what it needs. It adds all the right colors and details, nothing more, nothing less. The sound is well-done, especially the horns of the racing vehicles. The music is a bit childish - kind of a strange techno-like beat - but it is aimed at kids. About those horns, my favorite was the van's horn, which went, "Get outta my way!" and that's what you should be saying while racing to your nearest video game dealer for this game.
Even its sequels can't touch it. Love this, and will play it several more times.

Difficulty:
I've been with Super Mario since day one all the way back in 1985.  There is not a single "Super Mario" game that I have missed out playing at launch, with only two exceptions, "Super Mario Land" for the Gameboy and "Super Mario Sunshine" for the Gamecube.  Each Mario game was a revelation and just utterly fun back in that era, even though they were short.  My first exposure to "Super Mario 64" was sometime in the fall of 1996.  I just remember being in utter amazement - remember, though there may have been some 3D forays before "Super Mario 64", nothing, and I mean NOTHING, looked this amazing or played this awesome.  I would play the game for hours and hours, and felt like I was in a fully interactive novel or world.  I can remember thinking "Where do game makers go from here?  This is utter perfection!"  I niavely thought the graphics would never be equaled, they were that good.  I remember telling Courty's brother (my own brother's best friend) back in the late 1980s "Wow, just imagine if they go past 16 bit and go to like 80 bit or 100 bit!  Just think how amazing that would be!"  And with the 64 Bit, I felt that what I had been talking about had come to past.

1250	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The original Crash game was very hard to beat.  It was still classic.  Then Crash 2 came out, with several hard levels and tough bosses.  Then out came this one, Crash Warped.  This is the cult classic of the series.  I have beaten the entire game, and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge. I even managed to get a 104% file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know.  There are two secret levels.  They are Eggipus Rex and Hot Coco.  To get to Eggipus Rex,  you go into time trails in the Dino Might! level.  Then, board the yellow gem platform.  Keep running until you find the second pterydactyl (the triceratops will be already chasing you) and let it take you away.  To get into the Hot Coco level, simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the Road Crash level.  This game is a classic and every PS One or PS2 owner needs to have it.  Was this review helpful? OF COURSE IT WAS!
I love the fact that it's backwards portable. You can still insert regular Game Boy cartridges in it, like Tetris, Super Mario Land, or Pokemon Red.

Like Capcom did with Street Fighter Alpha 2 for the Super Nintendo, they did the impossible again here and crammed a 2-CD, graphics-heavy game onto a cartridge. Angel Studios did the job, and used massive data compression along with a 512-megabit cartridge to fit everything in. The result is a game pak that is physically heavier than all the other games in your collection. Whats even cooler are the new features, including a high-res graphics option and 5.1 surround. The only thing that takes a hit are the pre-rendered cutscenes, which are pixelated from compression. But its a small price considering no one expected the game to fit at all.
The game's one "gimmick" of a slo-motion play mode is fun for the first couple of hours, then just gets boring. I wish they had spent more time on producing a story (it has every cheesy cliche in the book, and is presented by a dull expressionless monotone narration).

A memorable musical score is present in FFVIII and while it's not my favorite soundtrack the music is always fitting for the particular event in-game. As far as sidequests and extras go FFVIII is bursting at the seams. There is a full-fledged card-battle mini-game called Triple Triad that could have probably been released as a standalone title. There are plenty of optional GFs to collect including the most powerful GF of all - Eden. There are chocobo mini-games and many other Final Fantasy staples too. There is even an optional 'Weapon' battle for those familiar with the battle against Ruby & Emerald Weapons in FFVII. This time around the challenge has been turned all the way up for Omega Weapon!

It doesn't quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our TVs.  But the Golden Age of the video gaming industry has passed, and we must continue on.  Sorry for getting nostalgic, but there's still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old NES years ago, with a lot of friends gathered around.  Perhaps I romantize that era to much of the video game industry, but I have a lot of good memories from that.  That's how boys bond (and also men - me and my best friends still go and play the N64 --- the latest wrestling game from THQ and Goldeneye always come in handy).  And for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days - don't worry, Mario doesn't have anything to be concerned about.

Sound: Each track is excellent (though I didn't like the credits song "Dreams Dreams, but that's just me) and fits with each area of the game, "Gate of your Dreams" is one of the coolest tracks ever, it plays during the stage selection. Child-hood dreams and voices echo through the purple clouds, and a very high-pitched melody plays. All the stage tracks fit with the themes of the dreams perfectly. The cut-scenes have no voices to fit the dream perspective, which is good. And the more I play it, it seems that the stage music changes a bit, and even changes into a different song, I think it's part of that "A-Life" feature.  Good thing the disc doubles as a soundtrack. *10/10*

Now, as a grown up (or maybe still a child at heart, lol), I came across this game again. Remembering all my childhood experiences with this game, I was fairly excited to relive it. Right after playing it for about 5 minutes, I started laughing at myself. I honestly don't know what I saw in this game. The game is so horribly crafted that it's really a surprise that they released this game at all. The graphics are ok (given the time it was released), and the weapons are kinda cool.

Another thing I like about this game is that you can cash your coins in for things like extra lives in a slot-machine like manner of chance. This game also has very good graphics for a Game Boy game from 1992, and looks sharp on the Game Boy Color. The controls are easy to figure out, but sometimes, when Mario runs, he can slide, and he can't jump very high either. What I do like is that if you lose your Fire Flower of Rabbit Ears, you can still be big. I've beaten this game a lot, but it's still fun to do. It's a great buy.
This is a classic game, and even though it's not as good as the masterpiece sequal, it's amazing how this game has stood the test of time.  Like other classics like Castlevania (the very first one released for NES) and Final Fantasy 5, these games are just classic.  Expect to see them around for quite a while longer.
Another interesting aspect is that  at the start of the game you get to choose if you want to be a straight out  soldier, a psychic, or a technical minded fellow.  The skills that you  choose can allow you to slip through the many traps and dangers in the  game.
Now that [the price has dropped], it's worth trying if you're really into Gabriel Knight. Otherwise, there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap. Try one of them.

Now, some people might say 6 racing tracks (other than multiplayer, that's it?? Cruisin USA 64 has 14 tracks.. However, the 6 tracks are not normal tracks.

This is without stops, or crashes. The handling is good on this game, so you probably wouldn't crash to begin with.
The Controls make me wish I was playing Shaq Fu! Im dead serious. Its incredibly sluggish! Every single button command has to be inputed slowly. To execute special moves, like scorpions's spear, heres how you input it:

  Not worth the price. I suggest that you should dust off your Super NES and buy that version. Avoid Mortal Kombat II on the Game Boy at all costs.  The only thing worse than this is the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat 3.

I have written down the order for the 101 Episodes.  Without this "bible" there is no way to know how to proceed to succeed in the entire sequence.  And I do not understand how one person could so flawlessly execute these for us as examples.  I am a well-coordinated person.  It took me free time as I found it (a lot!) for over two days, for example, to master the  one skill to achieve what seemed impossible.  And this has occurred repeatedly, for each new skill to be accomplished.

3235	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Even though it's over a year old, Soul Calibur is not only the best-looking Dreamcast game there is, it's the best 3D fighting game on the planet.  Period.  Nothing comes close.  A lot of people say Tekken Tag for the PS2 is a better game, but Tag is merely a rehash of Tekken 3 with updated graphics, and Dead or Alive 2 just doesn't have the same shine. Soul Calibur introduced so many new ideas to the genre of 3D fighting that it's hard to think how anyone will surpass it:  the 8-Way run system and Guard Impact are just two of them.  The graphics are flawless 60 fps glory, the sound crystal, the backgrounds enthralling.  Mission Mode and the huge unlockable Art Gallery send replay value through the roof, but the true treasure here is the combat system.  Helped by pinpoint control, beginners and veterans alike will find no end to the depth of the fighting engine that the 8-Way Run system opens up, allowing your fighter mobility across the entire surface of the arena.  People are still talking about the huge leap Soul Calibur represents for fighting games.  Namco has produced a work of art that also happens to be the most flawless game I've ever played -- a year later it's still the most played game on my Dreamcast and I'm still discovering new moves and techniques.  Soul Calibur has sold many Dreamcast systems (my own and all my friends' as well), and at the price the system and the game are now, it's an ABSOLUTE STEAL.  Everyone who's even remotely interested in gaming owes it to themselves to experience this piece of history -- games like this don't happen often, folks.

Mario finds the princess, rescues her, and destroys Bowser.
The battle system in the game is traditional RPG turn based format. But they use the turn based system to perfection. There are six characters on screen, 3 in the front row 3 in the back. Characters in front can attack freely but characters in the back row can only attack if they have long range weapons, such as a bow. Characters that share some kind of history, or know similar fighting styles, can team up to do combined special moves. These moves range from being simply entertaining to completely devastating. Charactes who can't attack from the back row can still function as fighters if they have a combo attack with another character. This adds a well rounded strategic element to the set up of a conventional group, since characters with combo attacks usually need to be in the same row or in the same column to perfom their attacks.
 This game contains some of the best voice overs I have ever heard in a game, with most all of the voices matching the characteristics of the people.  The only one I really had a complaint about would have been the voice for the character of Steve, which was annoying from the beginning, and although it did grow on my a bit throughout the game, just didn't seem quite right.  But that's a small complaint, and one of the few small things I didn't like about the game.
The rest of the cast isn't nearly as extensively developed as other reviews would have you believed. Red XIII's only real function in the plot is to get the party to Cosmo Canyon, and I'm willing to be Square created him almost entirely as an excuse to demonstrate that their new 3D modeling witchery could be used to make all kinds of new player characters possible. Cait Sith barely contributes any more than Red XIII does (Can someone explain to me what exactly is supposed to be happening to him in the Temple of the Ancients? Did he somehow gain sentience, or are we seeing Reeve get a little too wrapped up in his performance?). Cid is a criminally underused character whose only real purpose is to allow the party access to the airship (god I wish his stint as team leader in Act 2 lasted longer). Depending upon who you ask, Yuffie is either an adorable little scamp, or the most obnoxious brat ever attached to an HP bar, who stars in one single interesting world-building sidequest. And I should probably mention that I have never played Dirge of Cerberus so I have no idea what it has to say regarding Vincent's backstory. But if it isn't revealed within Final Fantasy VII-- as this game was originally conceived to be a totally self-contained story-- then as far as I'm concerned it is irrelevant.

When I got older (okay, yes, I was eighteen), and had a PS2 in my room, I knew I had to get a copy for nostalgia's sake.

Once you've played through this game a couple of times, it becomes pretty easy.  However, I still maintain that the game does have a lot of replay value.  Why?  Becuase once you have figured everything out and memorized the solutions to all the puzzles, you can get to the end in about 3 or 4 hours, tops.  But that 3 or 4 hours is time well spent immersed in the game's beautiful environment.

Four stars for this cause (like I said) the City of the Dead the game changes dramatically all the way to the end. But the first 60% of this game was excellent.
A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.
Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies.

Players can try their hand at a number of individual scenarios, but the heart of the game is in the campaign. In the grand campaign, players start out with a handful of core units at the beginning of the Polish campaign, and from here the player fights out the entire war to either its triumphant conclusion or bitter end. With each completed mission, the player has the opportunity to upgrade existing units for their core force, and also purchase new ones. Units also acquire experience throughout the game, an excellent concept that forces players to think strategically and play smart to avoid loosing these precious units. Win or loose though, the campaign is a blast. Win marginally and loose some throughout the campaign, and you could end up defending Berlin from the Soviets. Win big every time, and you could be invading America!

The levels in the game are great and you get to tag along with Diddy Kong in certain levels. I love the classic game and I recommend the game to anyone who likes Donkey Kong.
4714	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Where do I begin? I have played the first four classic entries of the series, and Lament of Innocence, the Mercury Steam Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and I must say that not only was this entry released in Konami's prime, but they have given the name Castlevania a whole new meaning while adding to the overall gameplay experience. The environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with 3D background effects, including moving objects in full 3D and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world, and escaping reality. With that being said, seeing that this game was directly influenced by Super Metroid, and perhaps some of the other Nintendo entries to the series, I must say that the Metroid-style gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits (or cloaks) you can pick up, fluid controls, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for. Another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such. That was beautifully implemented, rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game. You can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat, a purple wolf, or simply a handful of mist, so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before. Overall, this game is the most groundbreaking entry of the series, and it is one that I would not mind playing again and again, as the gameplay is as versatile as it gets with these style of games.

Now, whether you like FF8 or not is your personal opinion.. but I love it from the stunning introduction, to the spectacular ending which makes all of the bad parts of the game seem worth going through. I may not like it as well as FF6, but it's still a Final Fantasy, and everyone will remember this one. Whether it was because of how horrible they thought it was, or because of what a fantastic experience they had with it.
-Challenging puzzles
The graphics are excellent, as shading and cutscenes are beautiful to watch.  When Claire lights her lighter, it's a sight to behold, as it flickers realistically.  The only problem is the clunky control, as it seems to populate this series a lot.  It's a problem, but one you can adapt to (and you'd better, before you become lunch meat).

I would go as far as to argue that Starcraft is primarily responsible for global warming - think of all the coal we burned to generate the energy required to power all those computers and CRT monitors and light bulbs (and the heat produced by them!) as a generation of gamers stayed up all night fighting invasions and plotting fiendish countermoves instead of reducing their electricity consumption by turning off their PCs and going to sleep.

3. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles
You are Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox mercenary team. You blast through levels shooting up everything in sight, and blowing up massive bosses. The game uses a branching system, where out of the 15 possible levels you will explore a total of 7 in any given play-through. So each play-through is short, but there is replay value in going back and unlocking the alternate paths. And the action is so fast and intense that you'll be coming back multiple times anyway.
Solo missions follow a gripping storyline filled with conspiracy, intrigue, espionage, and yes, science fiction. Your battles take place on Air Force One, deep beneath the desert at Area 51, under the ocean aboard alien vessels, and deep within alien ruins. Newer puzzles, obstacles, and secrets await you in just about every level. The dialogue adds to the realism of the game, both during play, and between levels in detailed cut-scenes which develop the overall story. But be advised, this game is rated "M," so the graphics and dialogue are not recommended for our younger players.
 The game suffers from a minor bugs, mostly inherent to on-line  multi-player games, of which there are at least two patches  available that solve  most of these. There are some clipping issues, and I recall once getting  trapped in a tower approaching the succubus lair and having to restart from  my last save game position. I ran it at 640x480 & 800x600 on my P200  with a Creative Labs Video Blaster Voodoo 2 PCI card w/8 mb ram), with  little slow down and should be fine on 233's and higher. Unlike Tomb  Raider, Drakan doesn't suffer from nearly as many clipping or poor camera  angle issues.

Games to get with this:
Finally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such.
You can interact with the items and props in the background, search for weapons and food, and even get quarters from phones for vending machines! You can play arcade machines in Turbo Mall 2000, which is ehhhhh but still fun, and on top of that, when you press the L button when both characters are a person away, you can smack the other character!
1800	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is one of my favorite games from the playstation series. When it first came out in 1996, needless to say I was blown away by the 3D directional jumping. It was my first playstation game. Of course there were some issues that I had with the game but it was the first of its kind and it paved the way for improvements. Some reviews have said how the game is hard. I agree to a point. I started playing it when I was in 5th grade and I still have a copy today but at that time it was a new concept to grasp playing a game with 3D controls versus simpler 2D controls from the Nintendo or Sega. But after a while and many Bandicoots being eaten, crushed, boiled in acid, drowning, or falling into dark abysses I came out on top. There are some levels that are still difficult for me (Lights Out for example) but I relish in the challenge it brings.
Well, my problem(s)?
Also, as you are in the game, you obtain new objects and rides as you go along.  There aren't too many choices at first, but as the game progresses, you get more and more types.
I found that this game was scary, but not as much as the later games were, and in a different way. It relies more on "jump scares" and doesn't instill quite as much consistent dread. I was pleasantly surprised to still find some of the monsters scary and shocking, which I can't say for later games, on the other hand.


11 out of 10....and yes I did that on purpose....as Doom is more than perfect....
In short, Best fighting game ever.
If you want a hack and slash to be addicted to for less than a week, this is the way to go.  You'll be back.  If you want a hack and slash to play for a while, may I reccomend any of the Icewind Dale's.  If you want a hack and slash with a real good plot, try Neverwinter Nights.

The game also doesn't have a bad soundtrack either.  It's surprisingly good.  The opening title theme and the music that plays in the stages is actually good.  It just sounds slightly (not always but slightly) out of place for a Batman game.  But for the most part it's good.  I even found myself humming some tunes.

1947	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	There's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games. They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be
Highly anticipated, eagerly awaited sequels to million selling blockbusters usually have a knack for disappointing, but with Gran Turismo 2, the PlayStation's premier racing sim only gets bigger and better. For drivers who loved the challenge of the first, but who long for more cars and courses, your prayers have been answered with over 500 cars, and auto makers like Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz joining the mix, as well as classic cars from the 60s and 70s. A Rally Mode has also been added for more replayability and different racing strategy, as well as a game status screen that gives you the lowdown on all of your racing accomplishments. Even with these new extras, GT2 is still solid as a rock. Each new car has been added with the same painstaking detail as the original, and the new tracks (as well as some old favorites) also hold up pretty well. There have been some minor changes in gameplay, like the addition of tire and car damage occurring during the race (and massively affecting your handling), and horsepower limitations have been placed on most races, placing more of an emphasis on handling rather than on power alone. All in all, GT2 does a remarkable job of staying true to the original, without seeming old or tiresome. The glorious graphical detail of the first GT has been tarnished slightly with noticeable seam breaking and pop-up, which have to be a product of disc limitations (even though GT2 is a two-disc set) and the PSX showing its age. But the car models are still top notch, the sense of speed remains accurate, and the replays are still a joy to watch. The minor graphical complaints would probably not be so distracting if we weren't living in the age of Dreamcast. Sound in GT2 is again top notch. The cars sound real, down to minute changes in tone after you make high-powered modifications. The game includes a great modern rock soundtrack from the likes of Garbage, Stone Temple Pilots, Foo Fighters and Filter. These tunes will keep you from popping in your own CDs to cover up the usual videogame racing fare. The GT series will always be remembered for its control. Not only while racing, but also for the unlimited tinkering one can do on their car. More modifications have been added this time around, but the feel of driving remains the same. Newcomers may find it difficult to compensate for the differences between front, rear or four-wheel drive, but for old GT pros it will come back as second nature. Even though Gran Turismo 2 shows its age (and its system's age) and Rally Mode doesn't live up to the rest of the game, GT2 is still as close as you can get to the real thing and always worth the drive.

5886	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Yes, it is a good game. But admittedly Square didn't do as good as they could have. Junctioning tends to be VERY tedious, far outclassed by FF7's materia. The story is somewhat lacking, the characters are just very dull.
6989	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	In Donkey Kong 64, you get an expansion pack, which already makes the game a good buy, but the game is huge.  It takes hours to complete, so I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids, but the gameplay is great.  There  are five Kongs in this game: Donkey, Diddy, Tiny, Lanky, and Chunky.  All  of which have different powers which are needed to earn Golden Banannas to  unlock levels.  Besides the game's challenge, You also need to complete two  classic Rare Games: Jetpac and the original Donkey Kong.  This game  supports an OK multiplayer, but it is not as addictive as the game, and the  controls would be to confusing for someone who is not familiar with the  game.  All in all, this game is a good buy.
682	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...  END
1) Game Design: All of the stars must have aligned for the game play to come together the way it did. True character mortality makes the battles more intense. Weather, affinity, facing, luck, agility, are more clearly factors than they usually seem in other games. Character classes and how they can be leveled and discovered is so much fun to explore (Like the monstrous mathmetician and how he to use him well). There are a huge number of spells spread across all of the classes and the variety of the visuals and effects are incredible. There are so many things lurking in the background of this game that make it so incredibly deep and infinitely replayable. It is different every time you play it.
The farming system? Perfection! So simple and easy to understand. I absolutely adore the greenhouse you can purchase and I love the fast past feel. You can accomplish little things around the farm each day, little by little. That's the way I like it.

The story line is change a little bit. Instead of the "Pamela Anderson" of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky "Meg Ryan" of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.
  The graphics are perhaps one of the best things about this game, especially when it first came out. It uses the same technology that Donkey Kong used and it is at a 3rd person angle. Graphics don't make any game but it sure contributes to this one, Mario has never looked better...ever.
Sounds and music-wise it's very good. It has the "Zelda overworld theme" super-charged! I also like the Dark World "Death Mountain" and "Skull Woods" theme. The sound effects are both impressive and amusing. The sword sounds different each time you improve its level! Everything is quite fitting. Controls are very fluid, too.
And of course.......zombies, zombies and MORE ZOMBIES.

1793	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Definitely a fun game.  Great graphics, great controls, tons of levels and hidden gems to keep you busy for a long time.

4536	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Spawn for dreamcast is an excellent game where you battle against other players using multiple weapons. Vigilante 8 is just about the same concept, but you use cars rather than people.
The only bad  things about this game are the system requirements and the tutorial.
Some of the voices are pretty annoying (Slippy in paticular)


Secondly, the story.
Some very minor problems I had is that sometimes your main character moves around too quickly, which means sometimes you may accidentally walk right into danger, and the graphics are slightly dark and dated.  Just slightly.  Don't forget the occasional Playstation glitches.  Also, there are actually loading times in the game.  It takes 10-15 seconds to load a stage.  I thought by 1999, loading times were a thing of the past.  Despite these problems, Medal of Honor is still a near-perfect game.

Mega Man X also has the best music of all the X games.  You can easily remember and hum all the music in the game.  Some of the themes are slightly weaker than others, but nothing ever reaches over to the boring side.  Every piece of music is at the very least, pleasant (of course getting into the whole robotic Mega Man atmosphere helps to really appreciate it, hehe).  My personal favorite themes are the password screen theme (touching and sad) the lonely highway theme (when you beat the game and Mega Man is walking to the left) and the jazzy/dance theme that plays immediately after that (the screen where a computer or TV is shown in the background).
It's nostalgic for me, but after countless hours of gameplay and a memorable music score, and incredible story, how could you ever forget.

 Spyro is the little dragons name and flaming minions is his favorite game. At the beginning of the story, the player watches a cut scene with an elderly dragon answering questions for an unseen interviewer. He mentions how there are 6 worlds in the dragon kingdom with 14,000 gems worth of treasure. There is also a very mean guy, who guys by the name of Gnasty Gnorc. After the dragon says some rude insults about Gnasty, Gnasty gets mad. Gnasty fires spells at all of the dragons in the Dragon Realm, freezing them all to stone. He also turns some of the treasure into his personal minions, which account for the enemies that Spyro must face throughout the game. It is up to him to restore order back to the Dragon World.

5100	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game doesn't have a story... But that is actually a good thing! VR Missions is great for those of us who have to wedge game playing between an ever-changing schedule. Most levels take anywhere from 30 seconds to five mintues... and you can exit anytime and save your game. So, if you have to get up and run... you really haven't lost anything if you take ten seconds to exit and save.

Magic points used for casting magic is null and void in this game.  Instead, you have a draw system.  You draw magic from your enemies which you can either stock away for later use or you can actually use the magic right then.  Leveling up in this game doesn't mean a thing, really, seeing how when you level up, your enemies level up as well.  I kinda like that, makes the game more challenging.  Also, you don't earn money after every battle, but instead, get a steady "paycheck" at set times throughout the game.  The amount depends on what skill level you are on, the higher the level, the more money.

Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics are decent for their time (this game came out a couple years after Final Fantasy VII).  The cutscenes are anime-style, which is lovely because such animation  pretty much never ages.  The in-game background graphics are pretty good - they are quite detailed.  The only problem is that sometimes the backgrounds are too detailed - it can be hard to see items on the ground or to determine what is, and is not, a pathway.  The character models are kind of blocky like you'd expect for an old PS1 game, but there are in-game character portraits during dialogue, which is nice.
Finally, the skills and spells of your characters are diverse and change with enough uses to become stronger and more effective. With the integration of combo-skills, your fighter becomes a beast. The weapons and equipment for your characters provide a diverse and strategic edge.
4.5 stars.

Feel free to get the game, its awesome but challenging at times. I highly recommend getting it. Also it can work on a ps2 but you need the original playstation memory card.
You play the game as Max Payne, an undercover DEA agent who's having a streak of a bad luck (to put it lightly).  I don't want to ruin the story, but bottom line is that you'll end up having to shoot your way out of every situation.  The gameplay is superb!  With a short and painless tutorial, easy to navigate controls, and 10-20 minute learning curve, the game is quite easy to jump into and play.  The story plays out like a bad action flick, but it's fitting and actually adds to the gameplay.

The graphics are also ancient, but they are just so charming - beautifully hand painted backgrounds and moody lighting on the interiors with bucket loads of atmosphere. It never gets old. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on why the art direction of one product is superior to another but Baldur's Gate was done with such artistry and class, it still shames a lot of modern competition.
8502	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of my favorite games ever! The charcters are great, the job system is wonderful, and the story, music, and graphics, everything is great! Everyone who is a fan of any strategy game especially Final Fantsy Tatics would love this game. Also, it is very easy to learn the battle system and the job system. I don't think it should have gotten the mature rating, the only reason for this is because when you kill somebody on the battle field all these red squares burst out. Buy this game, you won't regret it!
This game doesn't go without a few bad aspects though.  The voice acting is classic in that it isn't very well done.  You'll hear such redundantcy as "Radio?  What's going on with that radio?" which is more funny that annoying.  But the poor voice acting doesn't spoil the game's mood at all.  The graphics also take a little bit to get used to if you're used to super-dee-duper PS2/Gamecube/XBOX graphics.  For those of us who were brought up around classic PS1 games, it won't bother you a bit.
8196	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Megaman X4, a game rivaled only by the SNES MMX titles! This game is definitely a well polished piece to have in your collection of megaman titles. Gameplay is great, with lots of "move too slowly and die" areas, cool bosses(although Capcom apparently ran out of cool names), interesting levels, and a very interesting plot. One of the more notable features of this game is the ability to play as Zero. This was originally introduced in X3, but then he was weak and couldn't fight bosses. But this time he's back and ready to kick some arse! In this game, you can choose between Megaman or Zero. Who ever you pick is who you are the rest of the game, which means Zero has more than one life and can kill bosses! Woo! Anyways, this game has a good level of challenge, being delivered more in getting through the stages than the bosses(although some can make you wanna bite a chunk of your controller off and spit it across the room, i.e. final boss). The weapons are really cool this time around. Capcom apparently had some real thinking time about weapons after two games' worth of dull weapons. The plot of this game is AWESOME, the Repliforce forms a Coup and they are labeled Mavericks. And in this game(and unfortunately, only this game, unless you look outside of the X series and count MM8), you can see the plot come to life in awesome anime cutscenes! (Capcom went lazy after this and made X into an unfortunate slide show with subtitles.) I haven't really listened to the music in this game, cuz I was too busy blowing stuff up in the enemy filled levels, so I can't rate it, lol. Anyways, this, X5, and the SNES titles are all great games and I would suggest you stock your gaming library with all of them(good luck on X3, cuz you'll need it unless you're made of money!). This game is a definite must have for someone new to the series and someone who grew up with the series. At least borrow it from a friend or your life will be shrouded in misery and pain!!!

However, the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers. There seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game - despite the negative comments regarding gameplay, the game's sequel, Driver 2 (PSX) is actually harder than the original.
8705	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I remember it well it was December 1991 and I was patiently waiting for Christmas. I remember all the hype about the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. After renting the Super Nintendo and Super Mario World I decided that I actually wanted a Sega Genesis because the Sonic The Hedgehog cartridge came with it and I already owned the original 8 bit Nintendo(while the Super NES proved to be great it seemed just like more of the same compared to the original NES just with 16 bit graphics). I asked for the Genesis  and when Christmas time came I got an original Sega Genesis system with a built in headphone jack and it came with this awesome new(at the time) game called Sonic The Hedgehog. It reminded me of 1985 when the classic NES system came with Super Mario Bros. Much like that title it set a new standard for platform video games with it's fast paced action,catchy yet quirky music and great controls (A,B and C buttons all made Sonic jump the D pad moved him around and that was about it).

Graphics are as sharp as the first two installments, and the music has a catchy, laid back tropical flavour (also seen in the brighter design of the enemies). The only nitpicks are the lack of story (Rare poked fun at this in the first two games, here they just don't try) and the character selection. It's odd that the series is called "Donkey Kong Country" and Donkey and Diddy are reduced to mere cameos here. Kiddy Kong brings back the heavy/light dynamic of the first game, but overall Dixie is still more useful and maneuverable. In the end though, this is a wonderful platformer that holds up well by today's standards. If you've still got an SNES, it's worth tracking down a copy.
  Although this game is extremely dated by today's standards, it's still worth checking out if you're a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place. However, it's not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube, so I suggest looking into that game instead. RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES. NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH RE 2 OR THE GAMECUBE REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL FIRST.

They are very addicting and fun! You can draw on this as well. The adventure mode takes longer folks. You can play as Yoshi,Luigi,Mario Wario. In The beginning of Super Mario 64,you could just walk in. But thwe DS version is different. You have to collect a rabbit to get in. There is more room's in this castle too with more levels. Instead of collecting 120 stars. You have to collect 150. If you don't have enogh money for a DS and the game but have a N64,dust off the original and have some fun. Or go out and buy your DS and game. Get whatever. You have to play this though. If you don't think I'm right,then you will be sorry.
Each Army has their own cast of Characters and each have their own strengths and Weakness.  With three difficulties for the story mode it leads to more and more challenges, sometimes you are overwhelmed and sometimes you have the advantage.  However in the end you can unlock two more levels and two more insane guys that easily gives the advantage to anyone who uses them in Battle Mode.  However if not in the hands of a skilled player even these might titans can be defeated.
The gameplay is fun and quite addictive.
There is SOOOO many ways to play this game, which is great. From the iPhone to PC downloads, to Xbox 360 arcade, and various collections, there is a ton of different ways to enjoy this game.
5151	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Easily the best game on the PS1, if not in all of Sony's catalog. It merged action, stealth, humor, and puzzle solving in a very new and exciting way. Voice acting in the game is impeccable and character models are quite decent considering the age of the game. Lots of unique ways to approach an enemy and very creative solutions to puzzles. There are just so many good things you can say about this game. The controls are good, music is amazing, the environments are detailed and open, the enemy AI is advanced, items and weapons are varied, etc.

The Verdict - Buy it.
If you get this game I would recommend the superpad 64 the one that looks like a modern controller. just because this game dose use the d-pad, crap get that controller anyway.
The basic story to this game has already been told, so I'll move on. There are so many elements that work together to make Silent Hill an excellent horror experience that it is hard to even begin writing what makes this title the best in Survival Horror. I guess I'll start with the basics.
9685	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game has so much to it! There is never an end. The very first course, Marion Club, is easy if you have the right drive, height, etc. The second, Plam Club, is a little more challenging. This is where it gets hard. The third, Dune Club, is very challenging! You'll need a long drive with great control and meet area. You may not want to use the special club [this is a club you get after you do a certain task. A place will open up and the club maker will give you a choice. Control Club or the Distance Club. I chose the distance club because thats what was vital at that point. I thought afterwards, I should have chosen the Control Club because when you choose the Disance Club, your meet area and control is not very good. So pick whatever suits you] because you will end you hitting something or getting it in the bunker. The fourth, Links Club, is VERY hard. It has alot of heath which are packs of grass very thick and they are very hard to get out of! It took me a long time to beat this Club. So the graphics are nice, the color is nice, and the levels, scenery, etc; is nice. But there is one more challenge that awaits you. It's the.........
This game  definitely deserves a look.  If you're a fan of the series, but it right  away and you won't be disappointed.  If you're new to them, rent it (or buy  it, even) anyway.
6531	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Before I bought AC I was interested in Ultima 9 which was a complete flop. Then, my brother had me play AC and one of the biggest things you notice are the graphics. Just clicking on the Life stone which saves where you will be teleport to is beautiful. All the magic is fun and most of the people are great. I recommend a video card that can support the modest graphic requirement. I think the ten dollar fee is accurate since the great people at turbin always update the game each month with new world events and climate to new armour, weapons, quests, and new lands. All of which you would have to pay for a new game completely anyways. But, with AC you never have to buy a new game because AC is always a new game each month =) I recommend this game if you want to be addicted I have been playing for 1 1/2 years and I don't plan on buying anything else until AC2 Thanks Turbin for a game you spent making for around  6 years I believe.

887	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I've never really had enough of an attention span to play "collect the item" games, but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with, honestly and unfortunately, a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time, with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game, and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this, but they just don't make them like this anymore!

I agree with other reviewers, however, that this game has zero replayability.  It should take you long enough though so that you won't feel like you didn't get your money's worth.
Some people say that it's too short, but for an add on pack it more than suffices. Clearing it in one sitting was mentioned below too, I'm good at it and played it on and off for a few weeks. However, the end monster and actual ending are both let-downs. The 'final battle' consists of a series of climbing ropes, using mounted laser guns and using your grappling hook over and over (and over) again. More like the Krypton Factor assault course than an pan-dimensional showdown.

It's graphics were on par with the PS2 and the Gamecube, and it had internet connectivity that made Phantasy Star Online a great adventure.

I'm not too sure about the AI either. Any friendly troops that you 'lead into battle' either refuse to follow you, charge straight into gunfire or shoot you in the back! Their average life expectancy in battle is about a minute or so. The bad guys aren't really the sharpest tools in the shed either, following basic patterns or causing you grief by being very fast instead of very smart.

3194	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Hands down the greatest fighting game ever made.  Almost a decade after its release it still tops of even the newest fighters out there.  Dreamcast had the most potentioal over all the other systems, to bad Sega Sold out.  Every character, level, skill, story goes above and beyond.  Top's the most recent Soul Calibur 4 that was released this past July.  This game should be ported exactly the way it is to Next-Generation systems with a graphic enchancement.

A tale of buried treasure, secret societies, ancient bloodlines, and puzzling relationships, Gabriel Knight 3 is a wonderfully complicated storyline, though not recommended if you're squeamish about digging into religious topics. Calling this game a "vampire story" oversimplifies it and does it no justice. If you're expecting hollywood vampires of the Bram Stoker or Anne Rice variety, look elsewhere. Jensen puts a new spin on the tried and true vampire legends, and does it with style, pizzazz, and all around daring storytelling.
In the world of survival-horror games, some go for the gore-fest and others for cheap thrills. Silent Hill stands apart, as a game that tells a compelling story and accompanies every moment of that story with a shot of pure, creeping fear. It's not the kind of game to make you feel queasy or get your heart pumping, but it evokes the feeling of shivers running up your spine like cold fingers and skin that doesn't seem to feel comfortable anymore on your bones.
combine to create an exceptionally well done RPG that remains a classic to this day.

Being a perfectionist sucks. The game is just as hard as I remember. Definitely a classic game deserving praise - no matter how childish it may seem. Croc is still enjoyable many many years later. Not as great as something like Gex, but definitely a must have for your collection of memories.

With every mission comes new technology.  You can build heavy infranty  units, calvary, naval armadas, war elephants, catapults, priests....and the  list goes on and on.  The Gold edition also has the Roman Empire scenarios  which offer a few more neat tidbits such as camel riders and Fire galleys.  The only slight precaution I would have for anyone is to stay away from  making stone throwers on the Rome version.  They are next to  useless.

However, I have no idea why the price for the game jumped up to almost 70 bucks these days.  I guess because everyone who owns the game refuses to give up their copy.

1683	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It is endless action in this horror survival game, but also puzzle solving, which makes it and intense and fun game. Of course killing zombies never gets old. There are also several versions of the game on this disc so if you want to play it over again you can do so with a slightly different version between the two main characters or the original version or directors cut version. This gives you four options.
9954	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a great game for anyone. Ever see one of these games in an old pizza place or something like that? This cartridge lets you play it portabley. You can make the screen like the arcade style games, with the whole area shown on the screen, or you can have 1/4 of the area on the screen at once. This game is such a classic, it should keep you busy for a very long time, whether sitting on your bed or sitting in a car.

As much as I'd like to say that this game is flawless, all great things come with a crutch.
1454	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I enjoy playing this game for the most part. I have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow. Unfortunately as the cities increase in population, so does the chances of the computer crashing - a very annoying problem. Also the parades last too long, the seaports are difficult to develop, the terrain for some cities, such as St. Louis, are unusually hilly, and the buildings look alike. The game is not that challenging. But overall a recommended game.
Sound good, right?  Wrong!  The difficulty of the Dreamcast version  is terrible.  I had been in the console/computer game business a while  back, and one of the main flaws I noticed is that computer game developers  are hardcore gamers, developing games for hardcore gamers.  This is a  classic example. ...

5939	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is the ULTIMATE game ever invented(other then Fable, but Im sure you already know I LOVE Fable, having read my other reviews). Diablo 2 Has soooooooooooo many good things about it, I don't even know where to begin. Actually, assuming you are a very busy person and don't have time to read CHAPTER BOOKS, I will just say this:play it yourself and see for yourself if this isn't the best gaming expierence youve had in your life. Trust me, If you get me started I won't even stop talking bout Diablo 2, don't believ me? just ask my poor sisters haha. But seriosly though, the best part of this game is the REPLAY value. On a scale of 1-10, the replay is 10000000000. Im serios and you don't even know(unless youve played it, then you probably do know) See ya later, reader, and BUY THIS GAME!!
Cons:
--The characters are pretty well done; their costumes are neat and not too outrageous, and there's a pretty good level of humor throughout the story too, even during the end scenes. So if you have never played this game, I seriously suggest you give it a try. Thank you for reading this.
Gameplay : The fighting system remains relatively intact, but I think that limit breaks are a little too easy to activate.

Then after a couple of weeks I played it again because some friends said it was cool. I thought I should give it another chance and I played it with friends, but the game just doesn't appeal to me.
The one timelessness Sonic 2 thing, that I will always love? The music. It takes my #1 video game sound track. Second is Bio Shock Infinite. When it's time to clean at work, I blast Emerald hill, Aquatic zone, and Casino night.

4375	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Okay im not much of a strategy fan, i have played them all the big hits and the only one any good is the command and conquer series i didn't even bother trying this game in 1998 (I didn't like warcraft 1 or 2).In 2002 a friend showed it to me and i played it with him(he had a lan in his house and i have one now too) and i tell you, it is different then any RTS i have ever played i mean i got so into it i stayed up till 2:00 in the morning playing it with him. I bought it the day after(hey it only cost 10.00$s at most places). Whoever said that is had a bad story on the single player is WRONG. It is the most gripping story on a RTS EVER, I promise, it is a story of betrayel, your allies might not be what they seem to be and it has main characters that you have to protect during most missions. It is not just a war between 3 factions. BUY IT , NOW GO ill be waiting for you on battle.net.

4516	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Civilization collection is one of the best of all time.  This has the same idea as civ 2 and family but has a diffrent game play.  The game has changes in three major ways;  1, you now use the mouse alot more instead of  the keyboard.  2, Instead of seattlers to build roads you now use Public  Works or PW.  I like this idea of the game better.  3, you can now bombard  units.  You basically attack them without attempting to take over their  square. This is one of my favorite additions.  The diplomatic options are  better and you can build more units and improvements.  I would HIGHLY  RECOMMEND to anyone anyone who likes straitgy games
Overall a great deal for die hard Saturn fans like myself...Speaking of Die Hard, it worked great with Dynamite Deka (know as Die Hard Arcade here in the west).

I love the game overall despite the bad voice acting.  Nothing tops the original, I suppose.  Oh, and who can ever pass up having their final boss fight inside of a coach-roach?
All in all i believe that the sega system made this game fall short, but still a near perfect game.
8596	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Love this game! Gets better each and every time I play!
There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play.

As everyone and their mother knows, Sonic 1's plot is that the evil Dr. Robotnik is not only capturing many small innocent animals and turning them into evil robots, but plans to take over Mobius (their planet) and turn it from forests and clean air to factories and smelly air (I'll spare you the New Jersey joke). It is now up to Sonic to defeat Robotnik and make everything right again.

The major shortcoming of the game (which was carried through the Sierra linage) is the mechanics of accumulation, distribution, trading, and collection of goods. This can be rather "artificial" and tedious.. but if you accept the concept, you can be philosophical about it and simply accept it as just another challenge all players must solve.

The game-play itself really hasn't changed much even from the original title, but lots more options have been added, the cartoons are more comical and "spunky", there's a lot more  choices. The worms are still their ever-cute selves. Cute new weapons like  Skunk, Bow and Arrow, Exploding Worm have been added to increase its  playability. If you want to buy one out of the three game series, make it  this one.

7395	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Back when 2-D fighter's were a dime a dozen,there were only a select few that stood out in both the arcades and the home consoles and "KI" in my opinion was at the very TOP of that list amongst other brawlers such as "Street Fighter- Alpha"/"The King of Fighter's"/"Samuri Showdown" and of course the insane fighting mechanics of "Guilty Gear".
5265	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Thief: The Dark Project, in my opinion, was pretty tedious compared to the fast-moving sequel. It started out fine, but it got really dull and annoying when I reached the zombie-infested parts of the game which include levels like Down in the Bonehoard and The Haunted Cathedral. I loved it at first, seeing new types of opponent apart from the usual guards, but the fun dies out pretty quickly because of the level structure. This is'll be a complete nuisance if the difficulty's set on Expert. The objectives of levels which have zombies and burricks are pretty demanding and they're all not located in convenient places. It requires a lot of going back and forth, which means that sometimes you face the enemies all over again as it's impossible to kill more than 1 especially since they move around in groups, so a quick glance, dart and hide is done mostly throughout the game.
I'm a big kid at heart, but no means am I a kid, so I can't keep up with many of today's games as they are too fast paced.  This game is challenging, but not impossible for an old timer like me.  The levels get increasingly difficult and offer enough of a varied experience to keep you addicted to the end.  A must have for anyone who enjoys video games and is a WWII buff.


The other idea presented is the idea of the enemies levelling up along with you. No longer can you spend an hour beating enemy after enemy in hopes that the boss will be easier this time. Basically the enemy gets powerful just as you do when you level up so it's best to just be weak, as it were. Also, in previous games, shops or even enemies carried character weapons and armor that were more powerful than the one currently equipped well now the weapon has to be synthesized. Get a certain number of items and the magazine listing the weapon, take it to a shop and they'll turn it into a weapon. Of course you don't know what enemy even has them and you'd have to consult an FAQ to figure out who has what.
2474	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Super Smash Brothers was one of the last installments to the now dead N64 gaming line. A perfect ending, if you ask me. This is't your average Mortal Kombat or Tekken game. You don't have limited health, you aren't crammed up in a tiny little space, and the computer player dosen't always win. You can run around on vast terrains, where items such as light sabers (Samus Aron or Star Fox, I don't know), pokeballs (Pokemon), hammers(The original Donkey Kong arcade), and lasers (Star Fox) fall from the sky, and are at whoever grabs them first's disposal. The levels are:Mario Brother's flying island thingie, Zelda's castle, Saffaron City, Star Fox's ship, Samus Aaron's near-destructed planet, Donkey Kong's jungle, Yosie's island, and Kirby's planet. There's also a hidden level, The Mario Brother's classic arcade world. And, now, the players:Mario, Yoshi, Kirby, Star Fox, Samus Aron, Donkey Kong, Link, and...Pikachu.

8930	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	First off, This is an extremely great game for those who liked Metroid and wanted to continue the story of the game. The game is a really great game and is what you have come to expect from the Metroid series, a really fun game. The concept of the game revolves around the idea that, Samus, goes to the a planet to investigate some kind of investation. This turns out to be Metroids a class of Aliens she encountered in the original game and you must go through and wipe them out from the planet before they have the ability to spread. The graphics of the game are relatively good for the time the game premiered coming out in the early 90's but the game is still a fun game despite the matter of graphics. Playability is pretty simple as it is a simple control scheme that anyone can quickly get used to and the entertainment factor keeps you playing for a while when you are in the car on a road trip. As far as replay value it is pretty cut and dry. The game progresses through and begs you to beat it, so eventually you probably will. Anyway, I enjoyed this game a great deal [or I wouldn't have given it five stars] and I recommend that you try to pick it up so you could have a little slice of Metroid joy.
These things usually come loaded with tons of codes for games. If you have a lot of games that aren't on it you can Google the title of the game, followed by a comma (one of these things ",") and the word "gameshark" or "gameshark codes." You can also remove games from the gameshark that you'll never use. You completely control what codes are loaded into the gameshark and what codes are active.
The boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don't spin attack them because they will immediately explode.
If you have a PSP or a PS3, download it from the playstation store. Or, on Xbox Live, you can download a high-definition version of the game. If you liked Shadow Complex or Metroid Fusion/Zero Mission, this game is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor and get it!
The story is pretty much "get outta Dodge", but the added affects of meeting various survivors here and there is kind of cool (although some of the survivors are not always the good guys). Also, each time you beat the game, you get another peice of what is happening with Leon, Claire, Barry, and more!
Super Mario 64 is a brilliant game. Mario can be turned into metal Mario, invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time. He can shoot from cannons and swing Bowser around by the tail. The courses are cleverly designed, everything is almost perfect. I use the word "almost" because nothing is perfect.

Music is subjective though so you may hate it.
I DON'T particularly like the huge differences among the races.. some of which have such constraints that they are virtually impossible to win a game with.. only 4 or so really lend themselves to playable games. But I don't think this is a "game stopper".. just a constraint.. It would be nice if some of the traits could be modified to more balance the game, but I truly think they were created to be a foil to the human player. As you play, you can use the "social engineering" for some balancing.

the cons to much back and forth in the game, bazooka won't blow open doors, the other issue is if played on the ps2 you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps2 games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look around.

Above all else, we have a Grade A, all American hero with a twisted sense of humor. Sometimes I just kill things I don't have to kill just to hear his comments. But be warned, the game can get increasingly frustrating as you go deeper into it. You just won't go to sleep, as you'll find yourself in a new mantra, "Just one more level and I'll go to sleep. Just one more level and I'll go to sleep. Just one more level...
The game also introduces the character Knuckles the Echidna, whom of which is the guardian of Angel Island, where Dr. Robotnik lands after his defeat from Sonic 2. Dr. Robotnik manages to convince Knuckles that Sonic and Tails are the ones who want to cause trouble, so Knuckles often gets in the way and makes things difficult for Sonic and Tails during the entire game. In verses mode, you can play as Knuckles as well as Sonic or Tails.
Ignore the hype. Final Fantasy VII isn't perfect. Don't expect perfection, because you shouldn't anyway. For better or worse, this is one of the titles that helped push video games into their current identity crisis. It was a forward stride in the evolution of a genre and a medium, and the next step will occur when the genre is able to get past it.
Dad went on a business trip to Kyoto, Japan and almost bought a Japanese version of the SNES. At first he thought this would be a great idea considering all of my friends would probably end up getting the American versions! His son, the boy who would eventually become a man to carry on the family name, would have a unique video game system that He phoned my Mom excitedly but then realized only japanese games would work for this particular console. And since his son (me) was not fluent in Japanese decided to reconsider and purchase an American SNES.

488	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is a winner, and a true classic.
Gameplay: Like many installments of the Castlevania series, Symphony of the Night use a 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay. The objective of the game is to guide primary player character Alucard who we haven't played as since Castlevania 3 Draculas Curse through the undead-filled castle, as he sets out to defeat the vampire Dracula. Symphony of the Night follows a nonlinear style of gameplay; at the game's beginning, Alucard can only access certain areas of the castle, but by obtaining the three forms (a wolf, bat, and mist) that he can shapeshift into, he gradually explores the castle. A map carried by Alucard automatically updates to reflect the player's progress through the castle. While previous protagonists of the series have traditionally used whips as their main weapon, Alucard can find and use weapons ranging from edged weaponstypically swords and knivesto knuckles and expendable items, such as neutron bombs or javelins. He can also obtain health restoratives, various equipment and items to boost his attributes; all located on an inventory. Relics found throughout the castle will provide him with different abilities, such as being able to double jump. A bestiary kept by the castle's librarian, who also functions as a shopkeeper, shows the different monsters encounted by the player, and the items they dropped when defeated. Additionally, Symphony of the Night incorporates elements found in role-playing games. His hit points determine the maximum amount of damage he can withstand before dying, while his magic points decide how often a magical attack may be cast. Additionally, he possesses four other attributes: strength, the power of his physical attack; defense, his resilience to damage inflicted by the monsters; intelligence, the recovery speed of magic points; and luck, the frequency of items dropped by enemies. Defeating monsters provides him with experience points, and he will level up after reaching a predetermined amount, increasing his attributes in the process. Alucard may cast eight different spells, which requires the player to input directional combinations and will use up varying amounts of his magic points. Over the course of the game, Alucard can acquire the ability to summon familiars: they function as complementary entities, aiding him in battle and exploration. The North American version of the game includes the Fairy, Demon, Ghost, Bat, and Sword familiars. The original Japanese version of the game included the Nose Devil (functionally identical to the Demon, but with a Tengu mask) and Pixie familiars as well.

9872	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I heard some many things about the original Grandia that I had to get a copy. Since it was the beginning of the series, I just had to see what started it all. I was impressed with this one despite it being really old. All three of the Grandias emphasize something grand in there stories:


The strategic level is good but not great. You collect  resources, you build things, you research spells, same as in most games.  One nice addition is the ability of high level characters to train new  units, letting them start off with some experience.  This solves the  problem that occurs in so many games of this type, where new units starting  late in the game are basically hopeless.

Becaus it also attaches to Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 so you can play as Knuckles. A nice added bonus which takes this game far!

But the game shines in its Combat Simulator mode. It is a mode where you make your way through over 25 missions, completing random objectives from Uploading a terminal with a Data Uplink, to King Of The Hill (which pits you against one or more "bots" to take on a challenge that has you having to stay in a certain spot for 20 or so seconds, claiming that it's yours. If you do so, while the enemy stays away, you get the point, and move on to the next "Hill") to my favorite, Capture the case. Capture the case is a mission where you must go to your opponent's hideout and get their little case, bring it back to your hideout, and make it back to your own case. However, if the enemy has already made it to your case before you get back, you must chase them down, which is hella fun, in order for your case to return to its original spot. There are more missions such as just killing your opponent 10 times or holding onto a briefcase for as long as you can.
In Diablo II you get to choose from five character classes which are barbarian, sorceress, amazon, paladin and necromancer. Each class is unique and has its strengths and weak points. For example the barbarian is great at close-up combat but is poor in the magic department and the sorceress is almost completely magic-dependant whereas paladin has equal amounts of both. This game is divided into "acts," which are sub-divided to various missions. You start off at a rogue encampment in act I, and then move onto the desert town of "Lut Gholein" in act II (which is as far as I went before being deprived of my copy due to the addiction). I had a little trouble conquering the "arcane sanctuary" with paladin. Aside from doing what you are told by townsfolk, you can also buy and trade weopons, armour, head-wear, belts and numerous other items, which proves to be half the fun of the game. You can store some of your gear in your private "stash" found in each town, as well as keep a fair amount with you during your missions. To make things less nerve-cracking, the game makes use of "waypoints," so that when a new area is discovered and if its waypoint is found, even if you die you can warp right there again. Also, if you die once and "save and exit" the game your corpse will be in the town in the next game, so all the weopons and items can be recollected. It's a very wise decision to make during the harder, more remote missions.
3213	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	One of the first games ever released for the Dreamcast, and one of the best, Soul Calibur is amazing from start to finish.  The graphics, control, special features, and fighting engine are superb, and this is the one game that if you own a Dreamcast you must have this as well.  However, good luck finding it, when the Dreamcast came out, it sold pretty quickly, and Namco only released the game in limited quanitites, but this is one hell of a game, and its a better investment to buy a Dreamcast and this game rather than lay down 50 bucks for a single game on any of the other systems.
The difference with said title is the serious fun Unreal Tournament offers. Moreover, the game is easy to get into.

the special stages are cool, but can be frustrating without a game genie. there are sonic 1 or 2 places where you get stuck in the enviorment. when you get all the emeralds and 50 rings in a level, becomming super sonic isn't a choice. but that doesn't slow this game down.
Junctioning isn't just a gimmick, however.  It's a necessity to getting through the game as your characters stats won't grow fast enough.  Different spells also have a different impact on certain stats.  More powerful spells will do a better job than their weaker counterparts.  You can also junction to increase your defense against status ailments and even increase your elemental defense enough to absorb spells.
What's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman's emotional state.  I'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly; it's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7.  Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully.  You see, when Superman flies, he won't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do.  A free-spirited main character...brilliant!
opening was good.........game play was good.
  How should I begin to describe this game? It's deep, engrossing, and the graphics are spetacular for a N64. Yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this, but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay, music, and theme. The story is old, but hey, it's a classic formula. Why change it? What would Zelda be without dungeons? This is one of the few 3rd person games I've played with great controls. The z-targeting system can change a traveling mode Link instantly to a combat alert, and maneuverable Link. The music fits the moods perfectly, from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods, it's great. Buy it, it's worth your money, and it's probably the best game ever for N64.
Reading other reviews on Amazon (and "Metroid Fusion" in particular), I cannot believe all the reviews "Metroid Prime" is getting.  Don't get me wrong, it's certainly a good game, but it is NOWHERE NEAR THE QUALITY OF THIS GAME.  By far, this is the best the Super Nintendo ever produced and it is therefore, the best in the series.  Sure, the graphics may have aged (note to you gamers: just because Donkey Kong Country followed less than a year later, DOES NOT MEAN IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER WITH THOSE TYPES OF GRAPHICS), but WHO CARES?!  This game is a masterpiece.  Don't be washed by away by graphics; BUY THIS GAME.  It's a keeper.

5553	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Quake II is one of the original gems of PC gaming, if not just gaming itself. The graphics were pure gold for it's time (and really, they didn't age too bad). The soundtrack was killer. And the enemy types and guns were just huge. This is probably one of the best shooters to ever hit the scene and is still very much enjoyable to this day. The single player is incredible fun and can be played in co-op, much like all of the older id Software games. The game does have sort of the 'blue key' feel to some of the levels, but really, that added a bit to the game. Some may find that type of gameplay to be dated, but at least this makes a bit more sense rather just all doors being opened like todays games. Do aliens not have locks anymore? One of the coolest things about this game is having the a dead body attract flies to it (black pixels, to be exact) swarm bodies. It gives you a feel that there's stink in the game.
Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.
2793	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I tell you this, the creators of Riven sure did their homework in the four year gap between the original Myst and Riven. The graphic improved drastically, meaning whatever computer you were running the original Myst in '93/'94 (Myst first appeared on the Mac in '93, then the PC the following year) would probably not be adequate to run Riven. Certainly Myst had made even greater improvements in the graphics department since Riven, like the 360 degree panning feature for Myst III: Exile, and even more photo-realistic graphics and animation for Myst IV: Revelation, but even for 1997 standards the graphics to Riven still hold up, although it's rather obvious the graphics looks a little more pixelated during some of the animated scenes (like when you take a ride on the cable car, probably to keep the animation fast without slowing it down for the computers of the time). But for the most part, the graphics seem so realistic you almost feel like you're there. Of course the big pain is this game consisted of 5 CD-ROM discs, which you have to swap every now and then, it's too bad they didn't have an install feature where you could install all five discs on to hard drive and only need to use one disc to play the game (like the much maligned Schizm: Mysterious Journey, a game from Poland that's very much like Myst, which had five discs in the CD-ROM version, and you had the option for full install so you didn't have to keep swapping discs).
The graphics are also very nice, my older computer (I don't know the specs) was able to run the game quite well when it had problems with most other games.

8289	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I play a great many strategy games and I consider myself to be a fairly decent player, though not great by any means. On the one hand, I truly enjoy playing IG2.  The mechanisms of planet building and support, the ship design, the research tree, and the general interface are all excellent and make the game a pleasure to play.  Or would if the difficulties (easy, normal, hard) were actually indicative of anything. When I play a game on easy, I expect to learn how to play and very likely win on my first try.  In IG2, the easy was so easy, I won before I really felt I had a handle on the game. Normal level should be a challenge.  I should need to play well, and in the end, I should still only win about half the time.  I've lost count of how many times on "normal" (as the Solarians) I have not even come close to winning.  I get wiped out every time by a Kra'Hen fleet so large I can't even conceive of what I would need to do to make one half its size.  Sometimes I die even sooner. Goodness forbid that I even try to play on "hard" difficulty. For any normal game, I have come to expect that the "hard" difficulty to really be "nearly impossible".  In IG2, normal mode does this, and I feel the game is hardly worth the trouble as a result. I have tried as the Shinarians as well, with similar results. In conclusion, while I truly liked the game architecture, I cannot recommend this to anyone.  I found this to be one of the most frustrating games I have played in quite some time.

The story isn't terribly original. What is original is the style in which it is presented. This is no slick, Hollywood-produced motion-picture like Tiberian Sun or Red Alert 2. The production style is much closer to a pared-back Japanese anime. To be honest, despite the comparisons to Star Wars or Star Trek, Homeworld is a much closer relation to Star Blazers, Robotech or Macross. Especially when you have spaceships like the Heavy Cruiser (a very close relation to Robotech's SDF-1), or the Destroyer (Star Blazers fans will LOVE the wave-motion gun effects from its ion-cannons!).

Some of the good games included are the Mortal Kombat games, The Street Fighter 2 games, and a game like Primal Rage. Some of the bad games were titles like the legendary terrible Shaq Fu, Ballz 3-D, and Double Dragon 5. One game came out that was very different, and actually probably the best fighting game not named Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter 2. That game is Killer Instinct.

Story\Originality: 2/10
Graphics: This was the first 16 Meg game on the Genesis. For those not in the know, this means that the game stored 16 megabits, or 16 MEGA POWER!!!!!!!!!!! Because of this enhanced storage, they were able to create more detailed graphics, more sprites, and smoother animations. The the smoothness of the character animations, and the bright, vibrant, and highly detailed backgrounds are simply gorgeous to gawk at, even today.
 The five new character classes  each have their own strengths and weaknesses.  The new Skill Mapping in  Diablo 2 makes you choose: Master a few a skills, or be jack of all trades,  master of none?
Unlike Mario Party 8, there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, DK, and Wario) are arguing over who could be the Super Star. After a rather amusing argument sequence, the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.
The story follows on from the prequel, and is intriguing, if rather sparse at times. The hero who killed Diablo in the first game, which you played as, is now possessed by the evil demon thanks to the soul shard embedded within him. Ironically the hero wanted to imprison Diablo within the shard, and then use his own body as a prison for the shard, but now the Lord Of Terror has overpowered the hero's will and taken control of his once noble body, and sets forth to release his brothers and open the gates of hell for the final time. Your job is to hunt down Diablo and playing as one of the 5 classes, you journey across 4 Acts, all of which are extremely detailed and well thought out in terms of difficulty balance. Act One alone is as big as the entire original game! The distances you can cover are truly humongous. There is a sense of restriction however, because there are pesky barriers set up to quarantine you within the zones. So there is no sightseeing here, you are given a path, and you've got to follow it in order to get the job done. The quests given are interesting and very fun, but the real shame is that there is so few of them. A couple more per Act wouldn't have hurt.

6854	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I just found my old megadrive and this game and played on it, I realized how good it was and how fun to play it is. I remember when I was 6 and played on this and still I enjoy it. It is a challenging game and even now i can't get past the second level easy (i keep drowning) I used a cheat to play on the other levels and they are as hard. The only level I don't like is Special Stage cause i hate the 3D graphics for it. The levels all are challenging except for the first one, the only ones I completed are Casino, Emerald Hill and Hill Top the others are harder. The bosses are generally easy depending on where you are. The last boss I extremely hard and another thing is you don't have any rings to protect you. Overall this is a classic game which most people should enjoy.

316	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this because my HDTV only had one S-Video/AV input. The rest were HDMI/DVI-Audio/PC/USB inputs. Seeing as though I like to play game consoles such as Dreamcast, N64 & the Wii, I've decided to buy this to hook up such consoles into it. The AV selection works nicely. You just switch and that's it. This device is highly recommended.

Fnial Fantasy V contains the complex job system that enables you to create characters of different classes such as Thief, Black Mage, White Mage, and others (all of the classes on Final Fantasy Tactics are included, along with a few others unique to this game).  The graphics are outdated, but the challenge of the game moer than makes up for the outdated graphics, and the replay value is high as well (you can start over, and make completely different customized characters to beat the game with again).
Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like "Did you preorder this!!". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to "I wonder what happens after this...". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic.
All-in-all, it's underrated. It's definitely worth a purchase.
Cons: Cant fly heavy bombers like the B-17, B-24, B-29, etc, Russian embellishment, Bad user interface, Runs slowly on older graphics cards.
Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got.
when you play Egg in the Classic edition you control a wolf grabbing eggs from chickens and catching them in your hat. While on Modern Mode your a Blue Yoshi eating cookies before they fall to the ground burnt to a black crisp or by eating bob-ombs if you get 3 misses your game ends but thats just the start this game has tons of replay value for the old fashion gamers of yesteryear if your a hardcore fan and you remember playing these back in the day this is one treasure you should not be without.
Now the  last hing I can say is buy this game or you will definately be missing out  on something big.

Otherwise....another great platformer from the golden age of platforming, collect a thons.

Three worlds with a variety of levels and bosses and a fairly short length ensure you won't get bored.  The game holds up extremely well in 2012, and I had no nostalgia-fueled rose-tinted glasses to view it with.  The platforming is creative and very intense.  Music is fitting, albeit low quality.  Graphics are good.  The only true annoyance is that the camera in some of the forward moving levels can cause some weirdness in jumping and landing on platforms.  Overall, I was shocked at how much fun I had with Crash Bandicoot.  I can't wait to play the sequels!  But first I think I 'll try out Spyro the Dragon, see what I'm missing there...

1419	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game is so much fun.  I've always been a big fan of Mario since the beginning.  The graphics are great and the sound is pretty good too.  There are many different goals to reach in each level.  Whether you have to collect coins or stars to open new levels, I know you'll love this game.
Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!
Donkey Kong sticks to the same story as in the arcade game: You control Mario who must navigate a maze avoiding traps and enemies in order to reach Pauline and rescue her from Donkey Kong. After you clear the original 4 levels, Donkey Kong kidnaps Pauline again and you chase after him through multiple worlds each with its own theme and levels. Now the main goal is to find a key in each level and use it to unlock the exit. To update the game and keep things fresh, Mario can use new moves, weapons and items to take out the enemies. He can even use ladders and flip switches to gain access to other areas of the levels. Once you finish a level or use all your lives, you are prompted to save your progress so you don't have to start over once you turn the game off.
When you first look at the controller it might seem like the weirdest thing ever. IN A GOOD WAY! When you pick it up and grab it it feels perfect. It does not only feel perfect, but it is perfect. To this day I have not found a single flaw with the controller. The buttons are perfectly positioned. The controller is simple and yet not too simple. Unlike the PS2 controller! The analog thumb pad is in the right spot and so are the analog thumb triggers. On the bottom of the controller is a little slot that you can stick the cable in so it is not in the way. The controller also has two slots in the bach fer a visual memory unit and a jump pack. In the front of the controller is a hole so you can see the screen of the VMU, which displays graphics according to whatever game you are playing. The plug fits easily into the controller port. Like I already said that this is a very good deal. You should get a couple of extras before they are all sold out.

I doubt I'll ever get bored with this game in the long-term.

3276	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Without a doubt the best Resident Evil game ever made, "Code: Veronica" will amaze you with it's beauty, and scare the hell out of you with it's zombie shooting action.  The graphics are super superb, looking almost movie like and giving you such a surreal feeling its like your interacting with a movie rather than playing a game.  And like true horror should be, there's plenty of thrills, chills, and a hell of a lot of spills to behold.  Never has being scared senseless been so fun.  Essential for the Dreamcast owner.
Streets of Rage 2 is a side scrolling beat em up that charges you on a quest to rescue one of the heroes from the original Streets of Rage, Adam,  from the Evil Mr X. The kidnapping, causes the rest of the streets to become over run by the bad guys. With that, it is up to you or you and a friend to take Mr. X and his goons out.
2.) Replayability and game design
Characters: Square dived in really deep on some characters background and left others barely scratched. Cloud and Sephiroth have the most character develpment in the game and their story's intertwine quite a bit. As the game progresses though, Sephiroth and Cloud's stories start developing on their own and not relying on each others. Aeris role and story in the game is probably the most important supporting characters in the game followed closely by Red XIII. Tifa, Barret and Cid get good stories into their backgrounds and definately add their importance in the story as well. Another member is Cait Sith who you find little about and forces his way into the party. Vincent and Yuffie are optional characters to have in your party and can easily be missed to get if you aren't paying attention, assuming you want them in the party in the first place. They don't play much part in the story and have very little background insight on them during the game.

8379	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I've played nearly every Squaresoft game for the SNES . . . I've played nearly every Mario game. Is this game the best game ever made. Definitely not! If this is your first RPG, well, okay, then maybe I can see why it appealed to you. But stacked against Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger? No competition. Well, let's get into the nitty gritty of this review, shall we? GRAPHICS: Admittedly, the graphics in this game are REALLY good, but they are not the SNES at its absolute best. SOUND/MUSIC: Goodness! It's been so long since I've played. Let me put it this way: I don't remember ANY specific tunes from this game. I'm sure the music was fitting, though. CHARACTERS: Like many have said, the ability to have Bowser in your party was just downright awesome. But then I can't help but wonder about this? Where's Luigi? They have this Geno guy, but they don't have Luigi. However, Frogfucius was really cool because I liked his name. But the one group of characters that I DIDN'T like were those silly Mighty Morphin Power Ranger look-alikes. I guess they were low on ideas that day or something. STORYLINE: You start in the 12 o'clock position on the world map and work your way clockwise, edging ever closer to this awesome looking sword that has a face built into it. You go down pipes, find old and new friends, fight evil, go to weddings, etc. BATTLE SYSTEM: Not too different from other Squaresoft RPG's--it's turn-based. Each character has a different weapon and special abilities. OVERALL: Only Squaresoft could have made this game what it was--any other company would have botched it up. If you want a fun RPG with variety and--most of all--Mario, then this is not a bad game. Gamers who like the Final Fantasy series MIGHT feel a little let down though.
The story nearly makes the gameplay endurable. I didn't know much about Vampire's universe, and was intrigued by the "vampire mafioso" storyline. Rather than preying on innocent damsels in distress, Vampire's protagonists are a human-sympathetic clan at war with other more sinister vampire families. The story unfolds through fairly taut and convincing (for a video game) dialogue, and the occasional cutscene. I was never bored with the story progression, and my curiosity about the next winding turn kept me playing for a good while. Eventually the infuriatingly clumsy and often poorly balanced gameplay soured the experience for me though.

Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as Extreme Battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrellas Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claires brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called Tofu and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective its the same as Hunks mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. Ive completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Dont even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn't worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. Its funny, even though I cant understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.
7416	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Too many words exist to describe this masterpiece game.  The original PlayStation had quite a few hit games in its time, but this would be one I would rate within the top 10 best games ever.  The sequels, not so much, but this game had it all:  the capturing storyline, the incredibly clear and believable character voices, great sound effects, but mostly the true darkness this game entails--hell on earth in mid-evil times, and you're a vampire with a cache of weapons and spells out to deal justice.  The view was interesting for it's time, 3-d from above, but it's amazingly easy to navigate, especially once you can morph into animals.

5697	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Final Fantasy 8 is about Squall Leonhart and his companions as they become a part of a struggle to stop evil from destroying the planet. The graphics was great and looking better than Final Fantasy 7. The sound was awesome. The leveling up system is the same where you fight and level up, but a new junction system is introduced for enhancing the character's statuses. For my opinion the junction system is annoying and helpful in a way, but you will see what I am talking about when you play the game. The story is great and will make you dwell in it. So get this game and you will enjoy it.
The graphics are phenomenal, which is one HUGE positive with Super Metroid.  You've heard countless times someone refer to something as "unique" and you're probably getting sick and tired of it.  Well, in this case, the graphics ARE totally unique, because I can't think of another game out there that shares the kind of graphics featured in this game.  I can understand people who aren't comfortable with the music in Super Metroid and find it disturbing.  Just imagine how freaky the music was for me back in 1994 when a game like this was the first of its kind!

8562	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Okay, all RPG's should look into this game.  Squaresoft and Nintendo make a unstoppable combination.  Unforunately, Squaresoft decided to take the wrong route with Disney's Kindom Hearts, which is nothing compared to Mario RPG.  The characters are sweet, and the little secret behind Culex is sweet (Theres a way you can fight a FF2/4 guy in this game with the original FF2/4 Boss Music.)  The storyline is actually understandable, Mario's funny since he can't talk, so explainings a whole new thing.  Add in a sweet Battle system, a sword, and Geno, and the games the best RPG ever created to this day.  No FF10 or FF11 w/internet will ever beat a game like this.

Anyways, this is a classic.
Instead of clogging you with a bunch of characters, some clearly inferior to others, you get two: a boy and his dog.  The dog is a powerhouse, and the boy can do magic.  This is the best magic system ever; you but your ingredients and you can keep casting the spell as long as you have the right stuff.

3308	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This vendor is quite something.  They sent me exactly what I asked for, the resident evil 2 N64 port in nearly half of the predicted shipping time, and that was on normal shipping!  This package is just a cartridge though, no original game box or anything.  Aside from a few scratches on the back labels and some dust in the main receptor, it was perfect.  My order couldn't possibly have gone better.

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
Story: Is rather linier not alot "Side Quest" and your basic Hero must save world type of story. 7/10

 I won't reveal any more of what  happens through out the game to those people who may have not yet had a  chance to play this classic. I think one of the several reasons why this  game is so memorable are the live action cut scenes, (which were the first  Star Wars footage shot in almost fifteen years). Kyle is handsome and  dashing, Jan Ors is beautiful and witty, and the other characters like  Rahn, Jerrik and his henchmen Maw, Boc, the beautiful and deadly Sariss all  go a long way to immerse the player in the finest first person shooter I  have ever played. I still find enjoyment in this title, even though it is  four years old and starting to look dated, the game still holds my  attention. Of the Star Wars games released to date, this is by far the most  superior, engrossing and ultimately rewarding of the lot.
  Final Fantasy V is a game with 4 characters and uses what many RPG players may know as the "job class" system.  In other words, the character can be a knight, monk, or ninja, specializing in skills unique to each class.  The magic is bought in stores, which I don't necessarily like, but the game itself is solid.

Well, "Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires! Neat! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential.

7828	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I've spent years playing this game as a child, and there is tons of races and a variety of bright optomistic characters. The best part of this title is multiplayer. Multiplayer has 3 diffrent games: Battle (you shoot eachother) Race, and capture the flag. There are 3 vehicles you can use in this game too. Plane, kart, and hover craft. If your playing solo there is also an adventure mode where you go through a nice adventure.

Lastly, I found this game a decent value in terms of length.  TOSC is now a bargain bin purchase, and although some customers here like to brag (lie???) about how the game only took them 10 hours to complete, Tales took me betwen 1 and 2 weeks to finish.  I admit that I may not be a master AD&D player, yet I did successfully complete BG and felt that my party was very much up to the challenge of the expansion pack.
Okay that's all the good stuff about the game, but I did say the actual game play was merely average. I meant that. The game is incredibly static. While you can travel all over the place and see the beautiful sites and sounds (which is a good thing if you think about it) the game will not progress until you take a specific action or interview a specific person. You play a detective in the game, but since the game is so linear you really don't get a chance to stretch your detecting skills much.
167	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	My son loves it he says it makes it more comfortable and easier on his hands for those marathon Black Ops 2 sessions.
Now for the bad...nothing ever really happens in this game.  At times, it is downright BORING.  You wander around in the pitch black half the time waiting for something really bad to happen...but it never does.  When I say this game is dark, I mean dark as in no light.  You can't see half the time and the worthless flashlight that you have runs out of batteries every five minutes.  The controls are sloppy and unnecessarily difficult.  The weapons/ammo are limited and you really have to search for them in some of the later levels which makes the game seem contrived, like they added that feature only to make the game longer.  Alien Trilogy was a much better game.  Like the Alien movies, too many sequels makes for a predictable and downright boring ride.

The sound is more forgettable than anything in this game. The soundtrack does serve its duty well in creating and maintaining a frightening atmosphere, but there's just not anything noteworthy enough to stick out after over a decade. The sound effects, while not fantastic, serve their purposes extremely well. Given the player's mood, one would still be prone to jump when a noise is heard off-screen.
7041	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When Nintendo first sent out its N64 development kits to third-party developers, there must have been a sticker on the box that said "please make a racing game." There is no way around it: You all have at one point played an N64 racer, be it from Midway, Human, Boss Game Studios, Imagineer or Nintendo itself. Luckily, Extreme-G, the latest one out for the N64, is quite unique (at least until Nintendo's own F-Zero 64 arrives next year).

The plot is that you build a dungeon to attract creatures to fight heroes to get portal gems to give to the Horned Reaper who collects them to get to go to the Overworld [our world].

The other characters not in the main lineup are good too - we got Doctor. B in our game - but he's annoying because he keeps falling over - but he has some good moves.

You can literally blow zombies in half with a single shotgun blast! To add even more creativity to the game, Capcom allowed the top-half of their bodies to CRAWL after you after they've been blown in half. Sometimes, only two or three handgun shots will kill a zombie off, while other times it might take up to eight or nine shots to kill one. It's all part of the mystery and uncertainty that makes shooting these bad boys so much fun.

No one had ever heard of a car game where you drive around blowing your computer opponents away. Even though the gameplay was drawling as you did the same thing for level after level after level, no one cared. That's how great this game was (and still is). Twisted Metal gave the world of gaming a new insight. It started this chain reaction that just could not be stopped. The characters are awesome and the gameplay is phenomenal.
Mario will also auto side-scroll through Worlds 2-3 and 4-3 on a submarine and airplane, respectively.

Zelda has been put out on gold colored carts and this set features the n64 zelda's  gold color. i'm buying it for this reason and because there WON'T be another gold zelda cart for a home system EVER EVER AGAIN . That's why this set's a must have set for me! zelda forever!!(2 controlers are a real plus systems usually only have 1 in the box leaving u to buy extra pads yourself)

The graphics are still top-notch, but the crme de la crme is that  wonderfully defiant physics-model.  Even though I'd had other racing sims  for some years, my first week with GPL was a joke. But after about 40 hours  on the sim, I could at least complete a couple of laps at speed without  taking out a flagman, the crowd or another car.  Another month and I could  actually race a fairly decent race, so long as I didn't get too agressive.  These are brutal cars on unforgiving tracks, just like the orginals were.  Close the throttle too quickly and you'll swap ends in a second, into a  brick building -- run-off areas were often non-existant.  There is little  wonder that so few drivers of the 1967 era are alive today -- regrettably  the cars and the tracks of the day ate them.
As Harry travels through the town he meets other characters - Cybil Bennett, a police officer also trapped in the town like him, Dahlia Gillespie, priestess of an ancient religion, Lisa Garland, a nurse haunted by something she has seen, and Alessa, a girl who seems to be at the center of the mystery of the town itself. He amasses weapons to fight the many creatures in the town, twisted creations of a demented mind, and finds objects to help him solve puzzles along the way. And as he progresses, he travels between worlds...from this world's dangers to the warped Otherworld of Silent Hill, where nothing seems to make sense but everything is connected.
NUFF SAID!
The perspective is akin to Baldur's gate and Diablo, although unlike  those games there are no multiplayer capabilities.  You still are able to  pick up companions in the game such as Morte the floating talking skull,  Annah the red haired half-demon woman with a rat's tail, Ignus the fire  elemental, and many others.  All of them have their own skills and their  own personalities.  (Quite often they'll bicker at each other!)

6570	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	First off, this is reveiw of ff6 in ffa. FF6 is my personal favorite of the cartrige-era FF titles. I bought FFA on a whim and am glad I did so. The first time I went through it, my memory card said 40 hours. While the disc-accasse times are at times unbearable, I worked around by using a ps2 and seleted the fast load option. Once you finish the game you will unlock FF6 artwork and the sound test. The feture I appecated the most was how you could memo-file(softsave) your game in progress.
This is still, to me anyway, the best game of the series.

TV Similarities:
BLAST CORPS is a good game, but only worth buying at a very low price.
In the previous 2 parts we had gems. Now, this was not enough for the overactive designers. They introduce trophies in this new part. For a trophy, you have to finish a level within an allotted time. This is not that difficult, but you cannot achieve it in every levels. Some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast. I picked all the gems and all but on trophy, and imagine my frustration.

956	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	My weekends during high school revolved around playing this game with friends, yelling, and ingesting copious amounts of kool-aid and chips.  Maybe it's the nostalgia talking but even today this game is insanely fun to play.  Let's remember the N64.  Cartridge system, ahead of its time, player of some of the most memorable games of the past 30 years.  Mario Kart 64 is definitely one of those games.  Graphically, it was gorgeous in the 90's.  The colors are vibrant, character models are blocky(anti-aliasing wasn't cared about much back then), and the music freakin' rocked!  Game play is excellent with each racer having their own feel.  There are tons of power ups and weaponized items to truly jack up your competition which helps to create some of the most frustration last second finishes or losses probably ever.
The game is one of the best racing games on the N64. It's better than WaveRace, Diddy Kong Racing, F-Zero X, and even Excitebike 64. Heck it's one of the best games on the N64! If you haven't played this game, then you don't know what you're missing.

Sanitarium throughout brings you in and out of "consciousness", traveling to different landscapes , sometimes in different bodies, and yet th ewhole thing flows very cohesively. I must admit the ending was a little disappointing and predictable but it did not spoil the fun.
8813	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is the only game that I play every day. According to the NES version I am a Tetris master. But this is a review of the Gameboy version. First off this is not in color. Save high scores. So if you don't enjoy old technology don't buy it. Stop reading, buy the app, the Ds version, or Play Halo for all I care. The game is outdated the new versions are better(in my opinion). But I enjoy this one so much. To describe this phenomenon I will give an example. The Gameboy version of this game is like candles. The newer versions are like light bulbs. Even though candles are outdated they are still enjoyed. When we actually need light we use a light bulb. So here are some positive things about this game.

  Remember, KA is a Star Trek game, so you know it's going to have bugs. If you do not install the latest patch the game will freeze during heavy battles. This is bad since the game AI will constantly be playing "bumper cars" when it starts to lose a fight. If the enemy ship is smaller than the vessel that you are commanding, then this is more annoying than fatal.
9059	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To this day I still play the expansion Brood War with my friends and step children. I have been playing computer games for years. Since 1986 actually. Warcraft was a great deal of fun but when Starcraft first came along I didn't like what I saw on the box (Strange alien graphics) so I didn't get it right away. My stepson finally talked me into and I haven't regretted it. It is absolutely the best game to sit down and relax and enjoy for a few hours. Not to thought provoking to give a headache but challenging enough to draw you back. I especially love it on battlenet with my friends and family. I have almost 800 wins online and we even started a gaming clan a few years ago because of this game. We now play many others, but we regularly go back to this one. One reason is when the internet is not kind to dial-up users this is one of the few games they can still play online.
The amount of mini games is the most ever for any FF. the amusment park has an arcade and rides. A battle arena to compete for really good prizes. You can bet on, race and breed chocobos. The amount of things to do is astounding. The sidequest are fun and can help your party if you complete them. One could easily get lost and forget about the main story.

If you're unsure of your game's "version", you can easily find out by selecting the "New Game" option on the game menu. You should see a "detect game" option, select it, and the game's title and version should appear. Anyhow, using it is simple, just choose the cheats for the game you want to play. You can get cheats online if you don't want to make cheats yourself, which is what I would recommend if you're like me and don't know a thing about hacking.

The Dreamcast is possibly the best console I've had the pleasure of wasting my eye-sight on.  It's the first system to launch with a successful online plan (*** for Genesis, it tried yet nobody I know knows they really DID try).  That, and it has some of the best games available for it: Soul Reaver, MDK2, Jet Grind Radio, Crazy Taxi, many more to name.  In addition, it has the most confortable controller I've ever used (good for big or small hands).  And now that Sega is out of the hardware industry and trying to sell-out their whole Dreamcast inventory, the price for the Dreamcast has now dropped to $50.  It goes neck-to-neck with more recent consoles and it's dirt-cheap.

"Titanic," is moved forward mostly by dialogue and certain actions, such as retrieving a painting, unlike many adventure games today, which seem to be more mystery/puzzle games.

8332	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	One of the things the saturn is best known for is the arcade quality games it had on it, this is definately one of them. Features include a cast of 11 fighters, each with a diverse style and interisting costumes, a decent amount of options including 2 variations of the game(2&2.1)some great backgrounds(the Dural Stage Rules) and argueably the best graphix of a 3-D fighter for the Saturn. Some of the downsides: the infamous floaty jump that allows your character to jump 3x it's hight and fly clear across the arena, the camera during the win poses sometimes gets stuck inside the character, then theres the missing pixels that plague every attempt Saturn has made in the 3-D world. When I first got this game I'd have given it a 5 but after playing Fighting Vipers and Fighters Megamix this game just started to collect some dust. In all a great game, but Fighters Megamix blows it out of the water.

4310	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Homeworld's best features-graphics engine, scripting, control mechanics, narrative flow, and mission structure, are so fluid, so highly immersive, that it makes the experience far more than the sum of its parts. The  combination of large scale fleet actions and cinematic perspectives creates  the most impressive space combat ever made for a strategy game. Its like  being in the middle of, and in cotrol of, a Star Wars battle. 16 single  player missions can make for some short gaming time but most people go  through the campaign at least twice-its that good. In single player, you'll  encounter 2 races, aside from the  main one that your trying to  decimate.

I first picked up the original Worms when it came out back in '95 (it featured the song "Wormsong", which is where the above quote comes from), and I own every edition that has been released since, and lemme tell you, this is the biggest, baddest, least flawed edition of them all.
Game Design-4/5, It would be perfect, but it lacks an ice zone or a desert zone. It's a bit short compared to, oh say, Super Mario World, but it has high replay value.  Hidden Levels too!
lots of cheats to make the game even better
Final Words:This game was great, no doubt, but Syphon Filter 2 was a bit worse, and it missed out on the Combat shotgun(Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game, not as good as the first.

Sound: 8/10 - Very much improved from the first Crash Bandicoot. When things hit the ground, they make a bang, when creatures talk it's amazingly clear and when you're in danger, you certainly know by the sound a creature is making, the rumbling of the ground or the thrilling score.
Unlike Resident Evil, which I do love too, the control are not awful, and Harry is just a regular guy, with no experience with a gun, and he has no idea what is going on, which makes it 10 times scarier than ANY Resident Evil game.  I think if you want a game as close to a horror movie as possible, this is the game for you.  Go buy it when you can.
I take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing, but don't let that stop you.  If you really need to you can always find a walkthru.
9247	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Max Payne has got to be one of my all time favorites. For those people who love John Woo action shoot them up with two pistols, The Matrix type action with Oozies or Sincity/Frank Miller Comic Books - this game is just that! With a brilliant Frank Miller type storyline and action that makes many action movies look bad, this game is a must own for any die hard action fan. This is a third person view type game though, but it does makes sense in that it would be the only way to see all the action in a cinematic movie viewpoint. This is the first game to introduce the new concept of bullet time. Bullet time is the idea where when the action gets so involved and gritty that the motion of the battles goes into slow motion mode (example: Neo in Matrix when he dodges bullets in slow motion) You actually see the bullets fly passed you as you jump back with two pistols blazing and scraping the enemy just as his bullets carves away paint on the walls. The graphics for this game surpasses any other game - even surpasses games such as Half-Life and Alice. There were several instances during gameplay that I forgot that everything wasn't real and that it was 3D sculpted. Perhaps most of the graphics are created in 3D Studio Max - which gives the game its realistic Hollywood movie look. Gameplay is excellent and there are many weapons to choose from (Single and twin Baretta's, single and twin Ingram Oozies, Pump action shotgun, Sawed-off shotgun, Sniper rifle, grenade launcher, molotov bottles, grenades, machine gun rifles, baseball bat, etc...) The game even features mods that you can make yourself and levels that can be designed by you. I believe there was a mod at (website address) that has a Face/Off level with speeding boats and face off shootouts in churches; and another mod with the Matrix lobby shootout with Neo and Trinity blasting away guards. This mod has even twice more the weapons than the game ordinarily has - including a kung-fu feature where you can do Backflip kicks, kung-fu roundhouses and kicks, and jump kicks all while holding your weapon. For people who are thinking - "but this is a third person view type game like Resident Evil!," think again - there is a mod that can be downloaded that enables you to play in first person view/shooter much like that of quake and unreal (You can even have picture in picture of both views at once) This game is definitely for people who cannot get enough of cool John Woo and Matrix type action movies. If you even thought about taking on the entire mafia mob all by yourself - Max Payne does just that! Buy it!!!!!

Most people who have lived around the time that this classic came out remember back in the early 90s when gamers everywhere held tightly onto their NES's and shouted "Mario! Mario!" all over the world... Okay, maybe not, but that's how the one SMB3 commercial went anyway. So it seemed that with the (then)recent release of SMB3, the plumber would always dominate 2D platforming... or would he? The Sega Genesis had been out for a couple of years by this point, and while there were many classics, no mascot was there to stand up to all the koopa troopas and toadstools of the big N. Enter Yugi Naka and crew to come up with the true origin of the battle between the 16-bit giants Nintendo and Sega: the creation of Sonic The Hedgehog.
The online community has seriously made at least 50,000 completely unique maps.
Be careful, though, this game will cause you to want to talk about its philosophical ramifications to friends who will be absolutely lost after you get absorbed into the world of Planescape.  The game is best played in really big blocks of time (8+ hours) followed by reflection about how great the game is.  I'm serious about that.

5318	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	First off, I'd like to thank Jaleco for the effort they put into making this game.  It's not the greatest in the world of survival entertainment, but it was a good first effort, and I wanted to acknowledge that.  The game has a fair amount of good and bad points, and I'm going to go over all of them, starting with the bad just to get them out of the way, and to end this review on more of a high note since I did enjoy this game more than I didn't enjoy it.
Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play.
To give the graphics some credit, they really do (perhaps unintentionally) add to the atmosphere and the loneliness of being on some faraway planet by yourself.  This is a pretty underrated aspect of the game, I believe.

I like it so much because there are so many memorable scenes in the story. I played this game once before, but never finished it. Now that I'm playing thru again, I remember battles that were particulary viscious - Killing the monstrosity in the Blast Pit - having head crabs jump on you in the blackness of the tiny air shafts - fighting the soldiers as they lob grenades and work as a team - the ride on the railcar - ascending the nuclear core using the portals - ....

Even if the graphics aren't as  good, the gameplay and action are better. The first time I saw this was at  Blockbuster and i just looked at the back cover and saw the graphics and  put it back down and rented Driver. In this game there isn't a moment to  sit still.

9625	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have played a lot of games.  I can tell you that Soldier of Fortune is one of a kind. Some may disagree with me, but I say that it's the first realistic first person shooter next to maybe half life. I love the fact  that if you shoot a guy in the leg, he hops around on one leg, and head  shots are automatic death. I love the fact that when you cut a guy, there  are actual slice marks and not bullet holes or nothing at all. I love the  fact that there are 'actual' weapons to choose from instead.. say.. a worm  shooter made out of an alien's spleen. Not to mention the great story line.  When I look at a game like this compared to say, Quake 3.. I think, 'Why am  I so bored with Quake3?' The reason is this.. Quake 3's single player  stinks... If you want to enjoy it and many other games like it, you need a  cable modem and play a decent deathmatch. However, Soldier of Fortune's  single player mode was very well thought out with a planned storyline. The  effect and suspense that the levels create is sometimes spooky... I am  always catching myself tilting or moving my head so I can try to peek  around that corner so I can see the bad guy, and then jumping when he  appears behind me. If you want a game that doesn't require a cable modem to  enjoy the game, soldier of fortune is a good bet.

7058	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I am not a big fan of "shooter" games, but my ex had this game and it was loads of fun! We only played multiplayer, and we would run around these maze type buildings and try to take each other out. We would set traps, throw grenades at each other and run like heck. My personal fav was sticking that one gun on the wall and when they went running past it, it would shoot them until they were out of range or sight. Being the alien was my favorite character; I just loved seeing my little alien rear end run past a doorway on his split screen. It is the only Nintendo 64 game I remember playing, and actually I am writing this review because I was considering buying a Nintendo 64 (and this game) just so I could play it again, because it was that fun. Then I felt I should share my experience. Never played Goldeneye, so I am not familiar with the story or any of that. Just loved the multiplayer of this game.
I would definitely recomend it

However, Final Fantasy Tactics was notorious for being an incredibly challenging game.  In order to survive some of the games toughest battles you'll have to spend hours roaming around to learn abilities and raise levels.  Enemies don't let up and they actually are quite smart.  They'll take advantage of your parties disadvantages by usually attacking the weakest character or even ganging up on certain characters.  It's also no help that their attacks deal a startling large amount of damage.  If you want to survive in Final Fantasy Tactics, level grinding is a must and it's not negotiable.

2551	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	It's been nearly fifteen years since the plumber wandered into the Mushroom Kingdom, and gaming has never been the same since. When the NES was released in 1985, the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic Super Mario Bros. And what better way to kick off the first year of the Game Boy Color's life than with a true Mario game? The Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the original NES game, with a ton of added features. And because the original Super Mario Bros. still holds up extremely well after all these years, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection ? perfection in Game Boy standards, of course. There are many different modes in the game, but the main game is the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. 32 levels of platform-hopping gameplay where you must go through the world, jumping on enemies and collecting coins, making your way to the next castle before time runs out. Collect 100 coins and you've earned a secret life. Make sure you jump on...aww, skip it. You've played this game before. What you haven't played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version. The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable, but this game is a whole lot of fun. It's a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi, and you'll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way. Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine, and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode, where you'll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg, as well as beat the level's preset score to finish the level completely. This is pretty darn difficult, hope you have a lot of patience. When I say pixel-perfect, I mean it. Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television, the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game, from Mario to the koopas, turtles, even the question-mark blocks. Granted, this reduces the screen visibility somewhat, but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix. If you want to see above or below where you're standing, it's all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad. All 32 levels, from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic. Nothing's changed. Well, that's not exactly true, you can now save your game in progress, something you could not do in the original. It also remembers which levels you've completed, and unlocks secrets based on how many you've finished. So it's not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game. Secrets? That's right. As you complete certain tasks in the game, you open up little hidden trinkets. Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer, or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out. Oh, and just because they could, the developers stuck in a fortune teller (just think "Mario Magic 8 Ball") and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge. Do they need to be in there? Of course not. But they're cool additions nontheless. Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time, even though it's almost a decade and a half old. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation, it makes me wonder if it's easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own, hands down, and will be the title that, hopefully, will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system. Buy this game. Now.

1) The Nintendo 64 version does NOT have the final bosses (Shao Khan, Motrao, Kintaro, and Goro) as playable characters, it also does not have certain other characters (MK1 Kano, MK1 Raiden, MK2 Jax, MK2 Kung Lao, or Unmasked MK3 Sub-Zero) playable.
Anyways, I got this game in Christmas 1994 and boy was I excited.  I am a hardcore X-Men fan and since many other console Marvel Comics games had huge flaws in the past (such as Silver Surfer for NES and Arcade's Revenge for SNES and Genesis, just to name a few), Capcom did a wonderful job with this one here.  Its a side scroller, beat'em up game with each of the five X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Beast, Psylocke, and Gambit) with unique combos, powers, and abilities that allows you to choose which X-Men is beneficial for a certain level.  It starts off when you have to go through Genosia for the first several stages by fighting different clones of Genosian goons, alien Broods, Brood Queen, Tusk, and finally facing Apocalypse, giving gamers the impression that he's the last boss until Magneto taps into Cerebo computer (in story mode).  Very innovative that the first and last stages were unique for each X-Men!  Only flaws about this game is that gameplay is a bit slow, some X-Men's special attacks and powers (e.g. Cyclop's Optic Blasts and Psylocke's flying knee kick) are slow responsive, and that the game was too short and easy.  A 6 year old can beat this game without relying on a password (password will not give you the special ending of which your playable X-Men reunites with other X-Men).
-Not hard, but not too easy, it's juuuust about right
The graphics are very good.
 The gameplay is a little awakward to get used to.  You are limited on what you can build depending on your mission and even then it is time consuming to build up a sizeable force.  This would have been taken care of if you were able to manipulate your ships more instead of moving near another ship and firing.  I really wish they would have allowed you to allow your ships to make evasive manuevers rather than just sit next to enemy and exchange fire until one is dead.  The ability to have more control over a few ships would not make it necessary to amass huge armies of ships to attack the enemy terriortory.  Being able to target specific systems on ships with firepower would be nice too.  Are you listening Activision?  I hope so. At least enemy ships do the the brains to retreat when they become heavily damaged.  But even so the AI is not too smart.


4760	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	"Symphony of the Night" is considered the pinnacle of the Castlevania series, and with good reason.  At a time when side-scrollers were falling to full 3-D games, Konami proved that there was still room for a good 2-D game in the gaming industry.
 It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5

The sound.  Alright, sometimes the music you hear is nothing more than scrambling awkward bleeps and whatnot, but you know what?  Those bleeps *work*.  Metroid is a space shooter adventure game.

9117	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	While not an actual video game, the Galoob Game Genie for the classic Nintendo Game Boy certainly is a blast. Whether you want to modify your level of health, ammo, lives or continues, or give you that super-secret power-up you normally have to jump through hoops to get, you can most likely find codes on a myriad of different websites for whatever you desire. And for those codes you use a lot, there's a flip-open compartment on the back of the device; you can print up the codes, fold the paper and store then in the compartment. This is a must-have for any gamer; it will even work with the later Game Boy models (Pocket, Micro, Color, Advance and Advance SP), so you can play your old favorites without wearing out your old Game Boy. Highly recommended.
CONS:
The gameplay, what's not to like here?  Taking everything cool about RPGs and pairing it flawlessly with everything good about action/platforming games.  The controls are solid, you can belt spells out Street Fighter style at a moments notice or backdash for dodging without thinking about it.

This was the last "true" 2D Sonic game. He has, controversially, lost his way (and his fans) since Sonic & Knuckles. The Sonic Advance games are good, and Sonic Adventure DX was also loads of fun.

 Straight up, this is the best  game within its class, outmatching even Command & Conquer who really  created the genre in the first place.

The Special Stage is different from that in Sonic 1.  Instead of collecting 50 rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of an act, you collect 50 rings and jump into a bunch of rotating stars that pop up when you hit a lamp post.  You also race through a half-pipe and need to collect a certain number of rings before each checkpoint.  When you clear all the checkpoints with the required amounts of rings, you get a Chaos Emerald.  These Special Stages are significantly more difficult than the ones in Sonic 1 because aside from needed to collect the required rings, you have to dodge a bunch of bombs, and these can be hard to dodge.  It also doesn't help that usually, Tails will get hit by bombs, making you loose some of your rings.

The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.

It's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan "Bond" movies would become an undeniable classic. But that's exactly what "Golden Eye" is. Many first-person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay, while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players. Thankfully, "Golden Eye" is the diamond in the rough. It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination. Moving Bond, James Bond is as easy as breathing, and the shooting system is just as simple. Even with the horrible N64 controller, a player can learn how to play "Golden Eye" on the first or second try. And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI. Of course, because of the N64's difficult-to-program cartridge format, some things had to be sacrificed, like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot. But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters.

"KING" from the Tekken series would make a nice special appearance onto the Bloody Roar game as a secret character to unlock. Bloody Roar is awesome with an animalistic wit! Compared to the Tekken reaction time when using your buttons to spin off combos, I'd say there is a 4 second delay with Bloody Roar making the game very challenging, since its more on accuracy and timeing, whereas in Tekken you have agility, speed, and timing with the combos towards your opponent. If your a grea fan of Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Guilty Gear, and Samuria Shodown, then yes you will also love this game. The graphics are perfect and smooth, and each time you play it gets interesting, plus with other things to do in the game like in Tekken.

This is a long game, but it is legendary.
3321	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The "Resident Evil" series has always been bloody. I've played through each game so many times it just isn't funny anymore. And this is  the bloodiest one so far. And maybe the scariest too. Taking place not too  long after the first "Resident Evil", the story this time takes  place in Raccoon City itself. An outbreak virus has spreaded to the town  (and, as you'll quickly learn, it's people as well) and everything has gone  wrong. Recruited by the now infamous R.P.D., Leon S. Kennedy arrives to  start his new job. But the rookie cop isn't alone, as tomboy Claire  Redfield rolls into town seeking her lost brother Chris (from the first  game). The two of you have to find a way out of the most dangerous town in  the world. Just like all the "Resident Evil" games, you have your  sidekicks too. Leon was always my favorite male main character throughout  the series, and his sidekick is my favorite of the sub-characters; her name  is Ada Wong (whom you may remember from the first game as a code). Claire  is my least favorite of the female main characters (Jill Valentine was my  favorite), and her sidekick, Sherry Birkin is the most useless little girl  in gaming history. "Resident Evil" is a lot like Capcom's other  masterpiece series "Street Fighter", the second installment  outshines the first one in every way imaginable. You're arsenal now  contains a bow gun (equivalent to the pistol basically), a spark gun  (equivalent to the bow gun), a machine gun (fun to use, but eats ammo a  little too quickly), and a gatling gun (more powerful than the machine gun,  and more funner too). As well as custom parts to your pistol (three bullets  at once), shotgun (packs a wallop, you couldn't miss a roach with this  thing), and magnum (it's almost like an elephant gun, serious damage, only  the gatling gun and rocket launcher are more powerful). Claire has the bow  gun, spark gun, and grenade launcher exclusively; while Leon gets the  flamethrower, shotgun, and magnum to himself. Obviously, Leon has the  better weapons. There are a variety of different looking zombies too,  including the first female one (not that I cared, I blew her head off just  the same). The other new enemies didn't seem all that scary or even  challenging. Mostly annoying, especially that licker. Of course, the bosses  are new and more impressive than the first "Resident Evil". Other  notable improvements are the graphics, the way the characters react to  being hurt (for example, Leon uses his shotgun as a crutch when enough life  is lost), the amount of zombies on screen, and the scare factor. You can  get four different endings in this game which ensures lots of replay value.  And getting to all four endings has a different path. If you beat the game  with Leon, you can save the game and come back and play it with Claire  which will be a different path than the regular one Claire has, and the  same goes for Claire if you start it with her, Leon's path will be  different. The most notable difference in the second route is the addition  of a new Tyrant that stalks you throughout your journey. He's tough, he's  scary, and he pops up at times you least suspect (you aren't given a large  area to fight him, usually it's a hallway or average sized room). That's  why I believe this was the scariest "Resident Evil", as  Tyrant-103 never really 'dies' except for, well, I'm not gonna spoil that.  My only problem with the game was the difficulty factor. It was too easy.  And the puzzles were probably done by a four year old (no, really, they're  that bad). 'Puzzles' such as finding a plug that's ten feet away aren't  very challenging. Maybe Capcom decided to take the game in even more of a  B-movie direction than it already had (their lines were always funny,  weren't they?). Nevertheless, this stands as one of the best  action/adventure on the PlayStation, but it's better on the N64. Why? The  graphics were better, the game runs smoother on this platform, and (best of  all) no loading. There's more secrets in this one than any other  "Resident Evil". Much better costumes (two for Leon, one for  Claire), the super zombie Brad Vickers (the pilot from the first game), the  Colt S.A.A. (basically the same as the normal pistol, but Claire holds it  gunslinger style and reloads VERY fast; you get this with her one costume  while Leon fires his normal pistol with one hand only) and gatling gun, and  let's not forget our poor Umbrella trooper Hunk. Hunk is another character  in the game whom you play as for a side game. You play your own difficult  little quest in which you're trying to escape with the G-virus. Was that  quest too easy for you too? Really? Then try it with Tofu. The funniest  thing I've ever seen in a video game. But also the hardest quest I've ever  tried. I'm a hardcore gamer, but this quest was too difficult even for the  likes of me. All in all, this is probably the best "Resident  Evil" so far.

Aladdin is challenging, but not controller-throwing frustrating. The one unfair game element is the bats, which harass you in cave and dungeon levels. They follow you, can be difficult to hit, and are VERY annoying. There are also a few object throwing enemies that cannot be destroyed and exploding enemies that are almost impossible to dodge at close range.
- Hiccups in frame rate occur when several explosions appear on the screen.
The car control is realistic, even more so with a steering wheel. In addition, you can purchase simulation tires for your car which makes it even more close to reality (and therefore much harder to drive). Whevener I race against my friends in the wonderfully designed head to head mode, I always destroy them since they are so used to the unreastic arcade racers, and can't even keep the car going on the straightaways.

Anyway, as for games, my favorite genres are First Person Shooters and Role Playing Games.  Once and I while I'll find a good game outside of those genres, but those typically stay my favorite, though there are naturally some flops as well.  I am pleased to say that Planescape: Torment is not the latter.  In fact this, even after these near ten years since it's release, remains as one of the top RPG's I've ever played, but that could just be my Planescape bias speaking.
Here you will face some of Dr. Eggman's earliest inventions, including Scratch, Grounder and Coconuts.  To defeat them, you must free more beans. To set the beans free, group 4 or more of the same color together. Try setting more groups of beans free to increase your score. Also, if you are playing with an opponent, your opponent will get more robo-beans. They cannot be grouped, but can escape with a neighboring group. You can be very creative on how you set up the beans.  In addition, the enemies get mad when you win, making it more challenging for each new level. It is so much fun to play, and we own both versions: the 2D version on Sonic Adventure DX, and the 3D version on Radica's Sega plug n' play game.
Now, as far as games go I think Super Metroid is one of the greatest games every made! It would be on my top ten list of the greatest games ever and I'm happy to have gotten the oppertunity to play this.
Reviewers may judge ff5 for being bad or something, but it is because it is harder than other final fantasys. I think this is a great thing as you can't just use attack every round. The job and ability system is awesome. You can learn abilitys on jobs and use them for other jobs. You could have a sorcerer have the power to store one of his attacks. You could have a knight cast demi. You can have a barbarian who guards other members. It is really cool and fun as you stay with basically 4 characters. These 4 characters can change jobs and look different for each one. The fun thing is getting to choose who does what. The story is great, as it should be. The characters interact and have personalitys.
*Marvel Vs Capcom 1 & 2- These have a completely different art style from MVC3.

MVC2 was re-released on XBLA and PSN while a inferior version of MVC1 was released on the PSX.

Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1.

Competitive ladders, duels, and just causal playing are all catered for with the ever popular Battle.net. You won't have to look far for a game to join, the lobbies are teeming with life even now. Online characters are created for Battle.net only and stored separately from your singleplayer characters, to prevent any funny business.
3825	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	NFL 2k is a one of the most realistic game for the DreamCast.  The game is pretty much a mix of hard-core football with fun arcade.  First off I would recommend getting a Mega Block Memory Card(they have around 800 blocks) `cause the game uses up 191 blocks of memory.  But you can call the your plays with out no one knowing on the VMU.  This is truly one of the funniest games I have ever played.  I would said the greatest strength of the game is the graphics.  They're not fuzzed out or miss colored in any way.  They are very solid and rich.  Game also has 1,500 motion captured moves.  The sound is amazing, it's truly is one of the best sounded games I have ever played.  The has 31 detailed courses, play editor, fantasy draft, ect.  NFL 2k does have some 2D art, but isn't to the point were it bugs to death.  I would highly recommend the game to anyone who is a football fan.
One of the original concepts behind the game was that the main character was supposed to be "non-violent", but that isn't entirely the case as there is violence of a sort.  The main character just isn't directly violent.  But this is one of the highlights of the game, not a detraction (as I, and most gamers, would normally consider it to be).  You can't just plow your way through levels: you have to think, watch, time your actions, and adapt to the challenges.  But, when you do get those few opportunities to just gun your way through a level, it only makes it that much more fun.

6352	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Nintendo64 may now be considered an outdated gaming system, but in my mind it will always be the best. Nintendo64 was the first system to introduce the joystick to the controller and has one of (if not the) best controllers ever made. This is the system that started the legacy of the James Bond games with Goldeneye, continued and enhanced some of it's Super Nintendo games such as Starfox and Mario Kart. This also brought such great strategy games as Starcraft and Command and Conquer to game console. It also made the legendary Legend of Zelda games superior even for modern times. It has made some of the best racing and sports games that never seise to entertain.  -In short- Nintendo64 is worth buying and I would even consider it over PS2 or XBoX
You could not put this game down. Me, personally, after 8 months after this game's release, I was still playing it because it was still that good (that and I was determined to play a perfect game and clear all the boards including the bonus levels).
Unlike other reviewers, I found the one area Myst doesn't hold up well is in building an immersive environment. Myst as a world doesn't have a logic. There's a spaceship, a boat, a clock tower, etc., just sitting on the island. It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world. I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world.

There is no other way to put it, the graphics are really great, surprising for an older game! The game is so fun, and I like the way you can customize the way your bot looks, moves, and fires. My friend did something that was so cool, I do it too. He took one of the heavyweights, and put on almost 100 LRM's and two gause rifles(Probably the best weapon),one on each hand. He then battled several of those tiny robots-whos name escapes me-and took em out, indian style. It was cruel, but totally awesome. I use that tactic almost every time on battle mode.

5742	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have mixed feelings about this game, because although it is my fourth-favorite FF game, its design was singlehandedly conducive to the end of the golden age of Final Fantasy, because this game served as a precedent for ff designers to consider "realism" in an FF game to be a virtue in its own right, and substitutable for some of the emphasis which they had previously placed on originality, continuity, and integration of the various aspects of a game. Starting with FF8, every game in the FF series is very epic in scope, but fails to fill the framework of its design with sufficient plot and character-related details. In Final Fantasy VII, there are so many tiny, optional events which round out the mythos of the game's world in ways that may be unappreciated at first, but collectively contribute a sense of groundedness to the fantastical setting. Take the discovery of Gast and Ifalna's videos in Icicle, for example. Final Fantasy VIII still has these types of details, such as the ability to read about GARDEN on Squall's workstation terminal. It just doesn't have nearly enough such details to flesh out the world, and after FF8, this element of the series only gets worse. Upon reaching Esthar, the largest city in FF8, the player almost as quickly leaves it, and less seems to be happening there than in the small island-town of Balamb.

930	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Ever since I purshased GOLDENEYE 007 on the old N64, I became highly addicted to it, like many other gamers around the world. I also have to thank this game as well, because it made me a hardcore James Bond fan.
The music is overwrought and almost silly. The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious, as if the game is saying, "Come look at me, I'm important!" The compositions are impressive musically, but they feel emotionally hollow. There is one song, a piano & violin duet, which I loved. It was completely gorgeous. I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued. RPGs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire 40 hour game.
I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.

1431	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game was the premiere launch game for the Nintendo 64 when it premiered and despite the fact that it is only a single played game, pulls off fun gameplay and great graphics. Despite the fact of newer systems like Xbox, PS2, and even Nintendo's own Gamecube, I would still be happy to have this game sitting on my shelf next to games like Red Faction and Halo. This game prved itself showing off the power that the Nintendo 64 had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a PS-X and even those who (like me) bought both a Nintendo 64 and a PS-X. But, not to mince words I'll explain the game. You are Mario one of the most well known characters in video game history. You play through this adventure all in 3D. This was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was Mario's first true step into the Third Dimension (Hushed Gasp). But, the game sold great and over time has proved in it's own right that it is a classic.

One of the greatest things about this classic video game that I have enjoyed was the MUSIC! WOW! Looking back on it now, I have to say that the music was just amazing for video game music.

this is terribly time-consuming and irritating. the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game. gladly, squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the god-how-could-this-get-any-worse junction system. this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand, and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss cannot kill you in just one blow. for example, you have to spend about an hour drawing 100 lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand points.
Streets often have obstructions (or mysteriously drop into oblivion) and you have to search for hidden routes to reach desired destinations.
This video game features four different street-fighting heroes: Mike Hagger the pro-wrestler gone mayor (remind you of a certain Minnesotan governer?); Guy, the fist-throwing karate expert from Japan; Lucia, the "Angel Eyes" detective; and Dean, the electricity-enhanced brawler. This is the kind of game you and a friend should play when you just want to knock bad guys senseless without having to worry about consequences. To ad replay value, you can take different routes in certain parts of the game.
  In this game, there's action, adventure, and awesome revelations!  Collect cool equipment such as the legendary Master Sword, meet new friends and enemies along the way,and even find a sinister, parallel world...

6017	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This is it!  Is this what the hype was all about? Totally disappointed with this game. Again, a game that took 3 years to develop isn't a guarantee that it'll be good (Daikatana anyone?). Diablo 2 is just all hot air. Lets start with the bugs. First of, let's start with the technical goof ups. The  game had problems with some CD drives. It takes me 3 to 5 tries just to  have my Creative DVD recognize the CD. This is a major bug. Second, the CD  had problems ejecting from my drive, thanks to the patch they released  v. 1.02, it still didn't fix it. Thanks for nothing Blizzard. Third, the game  won't run on my GeforceDDR under Direct 3D. So now, Im running the game  using DirectDraw from my GeforceDDR. I ran the game using 3dfx glide and  the graphics were so washed out and hazy. What do you expect from glide?  Now let's go with the gameplay. It is absolutely similar with the first  Diablo. Sure they upgraded the graphics and all, but gameplay is still the  same old Diablo. The game comes in 3 CDs. The first CD will take you only  about 4 hours to finish it because the monsters are just too dumb and too  easy to beat. You'll have the case of BOREDOM by the time you finish CD1.  As you progress deeper into the game, you start to realize that the  challenge becomes more of simply just finishing it because you paid [good money]  for it rather than seeing the end of the game. Motivation factor is zero.  There were a lot of new items and weapons not found in the old Diablo but  new items and new weapons just isn't enough to save this game. Maps are 3  times bigger than the old Diablo. Other than that, this game is just a  waste of time because it runs and feels like the old Diablo which is  already a tired old engine to spend your gaming hours on. I enjoyed playing  Nox more than Diablo II. Newcomers in the Diablo world will feel just dandy  with this game. Old Diablo players will go ho-hum with this one. My take on  this game, wait for the retailers to put it on the bargain shelves.
8663	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To start off with this game has some of the most amazing graphics I have ever seen.  It takes full advantage of Nvidia and ATI's latest T&L engines with gorgeous results.  That being said, you are going to need a serious machine to play this game.  If you don't have a Geforce/Geforce2 or Radeon as well as a speedy processor and lots of memory then you are going to miss out on this games outstanding graphics.  Fortunatley this game is able to stand on its own without the graphics.  The storyline is humorous to the point where I burst out laughing at many of the cutscenes.  The gameplay is solid, the designers obviously spent a lot of time with this games engine.  I have yet to truly play around with the multiplayer capabilities of this game, but from what I've seen in single player there is real potential for a great LAN game.  That being said this game does have a single fault.  I have found a few annoying bugs.  I am sure these will be fixed in a patch in the near future (they're not that bad anyway) so that shouldn't hold you back from getting this game.  If you have the system to support it don't just sit there GET IT!

1342	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!

Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures has you help Pac-Man on his journey. That's right. YOU'RE a part of his ventures. Anyway, the game is composed of various objectives Pac-Man has to accomplish.

The trick here is that the player has to be pretty observant and aware of what's going on around the scenery.

  As far as single player is concerned, it has six episodes consisting of a minimum of 10 levels, about twenty total levels for each of the three races: Terran, Protoss, and Zerg.  Each possesses unique abilities and disabilities, a uniqueness that is demonstrated in the missions Blizzard designed for the game.  Objectives range from destroying power plants to ravaging Warp Portals to killing the collective mind of the Zerg.  Certain levels have multiple outcomes, meaning that you might want to go back in order to beat it all.  Besides that, unlike other games, Starcraft makes it very simple to replay old missions, and the AI makes it interesting every time.
8077	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When I first started playing on this game along time ago, I thought the missions were a little boring and that's the first and one of very few draw backs I found.  Heck, the graphics are great, the sound is good, level designs impressive and large, but the fun factor I think is just a little boring and tedious and you end up fighting your way through the surprisingly short game to end up with a quite frankly awful and short end sequence.

1582	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The first day I played this game (about seven years ago), I was shocked in a good way, because this game is phenomenal.  Using vehicles for combat and multiplied destruction couldn't be better.  Even though its graphics could be sharpened and more detailed, the gameplay, and value of this game are in the spotlight.  Each level are unique from each other, and I must say that they include a lot of beautiful textures; they range from an underground arena, to skycrapers.  Using the sophisticated weaponry with advanced techniques will keep you glued to your screen; you get to retrieve weapons you see that appear, and use them for your enemies.  As for sound, the SFX is a little over average, it isn't as detailed or spectacular.  With the music though, that's one concept of this game that makes it outstanding; orchestra, symphony type music with a touch of hard core music makes this game prosperous.

After filling that quota, you must access the next level. Reaching the monkeys will require you to jump, sneak, swim, climb and fly through a variety of situations.  To help you on your way, you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club.  Throughout the course of the game, Spike will collect six additional gadgets.  In addition to providing the means of completing future levels, returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow Spike to capture any monkeys he left behind. In addition to monkeys, each level has tokens to collect. Collecting enough tokens will open minigames.  This game gets addicting pretty fast.
The game only features geometrical shapes and solid colors for graphics. Seriously, it really does look like if you tried to make a 3D world out of construction paper. The controls are waaaaaay off as in if you start running, it's near impossible to turn/stop/maneuver your character and jumping on enemies consists of landing *directly* under your shadow or you will get hit and die. Gliding is a smaller jump that makes you "float" a little.... it's completely USELESS unless you need to use it on those floor-fan-enemies to float up.

On the plus side, the environments are varied, the music is great for the Genesis (composed by the same person who went on to write the music for Symphony of the Night/Nocturne in the Moonlight) and the graphics are colorful. The special effects are considered by many to be in the same league as Contra The Hard Corps and even Gunstar Heroes, and it certainly comes close.
But you see - The main problem that prevents this from getting 5 stars isn't the game's own fault. It's that there are so many other shooters on the Super Nintendo, let alone the other systems, that go beyond the heights of this game. I gave the Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders 5 stars due to its brand-new game modes that make the game itself more fresh and fun.

Everyone will have a tough time on Mad Jack and Pufftoss but those bosses don't even compare to the difficulty of beating King K Rool. In Donkey Kong Country you hit him with a few barrels and you win the game. In this game you have to beat King K Rool in boxing with each Kong, which takes quite a while and a lot of trying over and over again.

The implementation of the STOREHOUSES are the key to this.. you have to learn this as the key to game enjoyment.. it isn't well explained in the instructions, so I suggest a bit of research before you start serious play. It is the weakest part of the game, but its workable enough to allow a TON OF FUN!
There are plenty of levels and stages in this game, and lots to do in all of them. But by the time I cleared one stage, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next. Finally, after reaching a mere 52 stars, my answer is no.
--The boss fight music is AWESOME! Actually, all the music in this game is awesome. Except sometimes the regular fight music. I've found myself stopping playing the game just to hum along with the music. Not a good strategy for a boss fight, :-P but it seriously is that good.


For those not used to classic Gameboy games, the lack of color in this entry is a bit disappointing. The lack of an in-game map and the fact that many of the tunnels in the game look the same also makes this game far more challenging to navigate than the later Metroid games. Once you get used to those things, however, the game will really pull you in.
2. Colorful shell variation. One thing I am going to make clear right here. I am reviewing the Gameboy Color as a whole. Not just the Teal variation. I do own the Teal variation so that is why this review is being posted here. There are so many different types of Gameboy Colors out there.  (From Wikipedia) here are all the variations out there of the Gameboy Color.

It just goes to show what can be done with a genre when a development team sits down and outs their heads together properly.

2991	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I wanted this game so badly for years, so I finally just went for it.  I heard it was one of the best games ever made, and it is true.  I actually beat it today and am so happy.  It was made in 1997 and still competes with games made today.  It has a great story and some of the best characters ever.  I got so attached to these characters.  I won't get into too much detail because other reviewers already did a good job explaining that, but it truly is a great game.  The graphics are fine for an old game, and I find the character design very charming.  The game is really fun, too.  I just couldn't stop playing, I always was so excited to play more and see what would happen next.  I even knew a good amount of what would happen ahead of time because of what I had read and seen, and it was still exciting.  There is also a lot to do.  After about 40 hours, I still haven't done everything.


9922	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I played the arcade version of this game back in the 80's. A mercenary is resurrected from the dead by Zeus and ordered to rescue his daughter Athena from the clutches of Neff, an evil and very powerful enemy who commands many monsters to do his bidding. The mercenary must find special power-ups to become stronger. Three power-ups will transform him into some kind of monster with special abilities in order to defeat his adversary. Each level you must fight a boss at the end and defeat him to go to the next one until you face Neff himself in the final battle. This game plays great on the Genesis platform and allows you to set the skill level, number of lives and length of the life bar. If you still have a Sega Genesis add this one to your collection.

I will admit that once you got the match started on the PSone version, the game itself was faster than N64's version but still, anyone could appreciate not having to wait 5 Minutes to play a simple game. The controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it, you're golden and you don't have to worry about a thing.

This is a really good simulation type game.  Plus you can control where the people go and you can kill some people in the water and sometimes the rollercoaster will chrash and kill people.  That is really fun when you get board.

Great gameplay, immersive and rich storyline, fun multiplayer experience. Highly recommended!
If there are people studying the history of video games fifty years from now, there is little doubt that Final Fantasy 7 would be one of the games they would look at, since it is probably the most influential console RPG ever.  If you haven't played this game yet and have any interest in RPGs, at all, you should try to find a copy of this game and play it.  If only Square-Enix would re-make this game for the PS3!
3856	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Very fun
I have so many friends that think a system with fun titles can actually "die."  "You still play that?  They stopped making them and don't make games for it anymore!  It's dead, it's old! It came out in 1999!" Uh, that really wasn't that long ago.  I still want an Atari 2600, but I got a Pocket PC and a few more games at the top of my list!
8856	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Turn-based strategy is a kind of archaic genre. Not in the sense that it can't be great--4 of 5 of Computer Gaming World's nominees for best strategy game in 2003 were turn-based--but that it hearkens back to an earlier era, before Real Time Strategy games like "WarCraft" and "Command and Conquer" ruled the earth. There's less immediacy to a turn-based game. They favor long, drawn-out thought and elaborate moves (and, yes, micromanagement) over immediate visceral thrills. Even though RTSes were born of TBSes, they've outstripped them in terms of popularity the way football outstrips chess.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
This is a very good, even excellent game that can't classified as a genre - a game where you needn't read faq in fear of unrecoverables, where you have to think how to beat puzzles AND even how to beat enemy groups, where there is time for hacking AND time for strategy, too. Voice acting is perfectly suited to misanthropic and revenge hungry main character.
So, the next time some gaming industry MBA (who probably could not tell an RTS from an cRPG) tables the idea of LIMITED INSTALLATIONS, what he will have primarily accomplished is to have his game forgotten within a year.

The main problem with Suikoden is that it is too short. With monster games out right now that take 60 + hours to beat such as Grandia and Xenogears, Suikoden only has about 20-25 hours. However, the replay is high with trying to find all 108 playable characters. The game is also very easy, which may annoy experienced RPG gamers.
Omega Weapon anyone?
If you have never played the other Golden Axe game, you should know that players can harm each other but by staying apart, you should be fine working together to fight off barages of enemies.
The PROS: Capcom had held the license to make games based on Disney properties. Aladdin looks and sounds great thanks to its bright graphics, excellent music, sound effects and even includes songs featured in the movie. The controls are spot on so controlling Aladdin is never an issue. Once you finish a stage, you are given a password so it's easy to stop where you are and continue your progress later.

3165	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	FF7... if you've ever played this game, the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is, basically, sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud, Barrett, and Tifa (oh, yeah, there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in, equipped with HUGE swords, a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those), and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play, and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect, with tight controls which respond perfectly, an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm, and some kick ... bosses. ...

5764	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	If you fell in love with Final Fantasy VII, like I did, and are so hungry for more that you are considering this game, I beg of you, don't do it. It is nothing like the aforementioned masterpiece. The story was slow to get going, which I was sympathetic to, since it was like that in FF VII too, but after hours it was still lame. For one thing, you have a "military ranking", and it goes down when you explore the towns! I mean come on, the whole point of an RPG is exploring! But that is not the worst part. The magic system has been redone, and it's HORRIBLE. Instead of the product-of-genius Materia system in FF VII, they have the "draw system". You have to collect magic spells, and use them, like petty items! This is, by far, the worst idea ever.
2815	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Ape Escape is on one of the sleekest action games on Playstation, which is, in theory, a pretty low-power console. The graphics, despite being  rather choppy, are colorful and well-textured. Most of all, the game has a  high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of, which allows  things to move quickly and smoothly. The control scheme is intuitive  despite being complex at the outset. Fortunately, no action you can take  requires pressing more than one button. Right shoulder buttons are jumping,  left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a first-person  lookaround mode, digital d-pad moves the camera, left and right sticks move  the character and the selected tool respectively, which the X, triangle,  circle, and square buttons select your tool. Also, the controls are quite  tight, which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and  such. The camera is one of the best I've ever seen. It rarely swings around  the character, although at times I did experience a few odd, glitchy  perspectives, such as from behind walls and from under floors. Fortunately,  the camera is spring-loaded to auto-center on the character.

7230	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	If you read my review of Rainbow Six on Dreamcast, you may remember me saying how it was a huge downer. You also may remember me saying to "skip R6 and go immediately to Perfect Dark". So now, I'm reviewing Perfect Dark. This is the best reason to have an N64. First off, the graphics are really good.  After Conker's Bad Fur Day, this game most likely has the best N64 graphics. The frame rate is smooth and ultimately, very playable for the 1-player and multiplayer modes. The characters in the cinemas don't move their mouths at all, but so what? Their faces are usually looking at another character or somewhere that the player can't see. The sounds are also very good here. Very realistic sound effects for the guns and other objects and weapons are helpful for creating the perfect mood. But the best parts about the sound are the voices and the foot-step noises. When you walk, you hear your feet moving along any terrain you are on, whether it's snow, carpet, chain link floors or ladders and they match the speed you are moving at. The voices also are very well done. Usually, voices in games are so melodramatic or silly and unserious that they make you hate the characters or wish you were back in the day when voices didn't exist in games. But here, the voices suit the characters so well and they are so serious that they make you care about these characters. You'll feel bad when Cassandra De Vries gets her comeuppance, when you fail a mission resulting in Elvis's (the alien of course)or Daniel Carrington's death, and you'll shed a few tears when Dr. Carrol make his incredibly noble decision late in the game. Another good point is the story. It reminds me of Goldeneye meets The X-Files and it's like watching a movie. And like a good flick, it keeps you engrossed and enthralled until the end. All these points I made are good, but how does the game handle? Even better then Goldeneye did. If you've played Goldeneye before, you'll feel right at home with Perfect Dark. I'm not kidding, I had the controls down the moment I started moving around. Even if you didn't play Goldeneye, you'll still get into this game with relative ease. Plus, the new control methods (like the pop-up weapon menu and simulant command menu) are easy to learn. The best part about this game though, is the mutilplayer mode. There are so many options to choose from and you can play the game however you want to. Along with four human players, you can add up to 8 computer controled characters known as simulants, and again, you can edit anything you want to with these guys. Want to mix body and head types to make for a funny looking character, human or simulant? You can do it. Want to make enemies so skilled that they exceed the performance of real humans? You can do it. One thing though: make sure you get an Expansion Pak (sold seperately)with the game, cause you'll need it to play 3 and 4 player and 1 player story mode. If you have an N64, you must buy this game. You'll love it.
Recommended party:  Cloud, Cid and Barret; you'll be laughing like crazy!

-Terrible land animation.
One of the best games platformer or otherwise.
Plot: Lex Luthor has trapped Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Prof. Hamilton in a virtual world with Kryptonite fog in it and Supe has to go in and rescue them while putting down the Super-Villains Luthor purposely put there.

Also different is that you now can deliver paper to the other side of the street. The graphics aren't as sharp as the first one(which was originally an arcade game released in 1984) and there are no voice samples.
Buy the game and see for yourself. This isn't exactly a hard challenge of a game, but it isn't exactly that simple either. Just right. Get it today!

They had great ideas for this game: You take Sub Zero from the Mortal Kombat series, use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks, set it in cool locales and incorporate MK inspired game play and controls in an action adventure, side scroller with light RPG influences. What could possibly go wrong??? How about....EVERYTHING in this game.

This game allows you to do all kinds of things.  You can build a variety of rides from the kiddie ones (haunted house, curly slide, carousel, Ferris wheel) to scary, complex roller coasters.  You can even name the rides!  The roller coasters can come pre-made or, when you get more advanced, you can design your own.  There are also a variety of concession stands to build including a burger place, soft drink stand, balloon stand, popcorn, pizza, french fries, you name it!  Different scenery can be chosen too, including those with a Greek, Roman, or Egyptian theme to really give your park character. As you play the game, new rides, scenery, and concession stands will be introduced.  Each time I play, I discover something new!  You also get to hire maintenance men, handymen, security guards, and entertainers (guys dressed up like pandas, elephants, or tigers). You do not have to baby-sit the game as much as Theme Hospital, as your workers always go where they're needed.  Sometimes, you need to move handymen to different spots to clean up vomit and litter faster.  Remember to hire enough maintenance men to inspect the rides, otherwise CRASH!  Patrons can die in this game, so watch out!  You can also check what the customers are thinking about your park and the different rides.  The only annoying part of the game is when customer after customer gets lost and the game keeps beeping at you.  You have to adjust the walk ways to prevent this.  Otherwise, this game is loads of fun, easy to learn, and very rewarding when you begin to see the amusement park of your dreams taking shape!
pretty cool but nothing really cool.
However the gameplay is very repetitive and you'll mostly be tapping Y throughout the game.  There is little challenge to the game to the point where I have not lost a life in this game in a VERY long time.  This game was clearly intended for children, but I can still enjoy it.  Also despite forming the Megazord, he's only needed for two fights.  the first fight feels random, though it's like a training course, because the final boss will have two rounds.
8863	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is my fav metriod game! I don't have the super Nintendo copy yet but I have it for the wii vc and so fun!
Unlike the rest of the games in the series, if you didn?t like the others this game ?Will? change your mind, fans of any genre with love and respect this game for years to come and justifiably so. The voice acting is spot on and the characters facial details when they talk is phenomenal, to the extent that it (at times) surpasses the almighty Shenmue. In conclusion this is one game that defiantly does the Dreamcast justice.
7085	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Love this game. It's like a slightly upgraded original doom so if you love the first one you probably love this game as well.
Gameplay: 10/10

3. The puzzles are well-integrated into the story, and allow you to use some of the equipment and consoles that you've always wanted to try. I did not consider the bulk of the puzzles to be particularly difficult, although they do require some out-of-the-box thinking. There are lots of alternate endings in this game: most of them start with your demise, after which there is a commentary from Q as to the "efficacy" of your efforts.
Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours.

393	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Good game overall. Its fun and easy but rewarding. The voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too. If you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this game.
When I learnt that (from the strategy guide) I realised how much more fun it was.
4) Music: The soundtrack maintains the high level established in the first two Gabriel Knight games. It greatly completes all kinds of scenes and makes you shiver in dangerous game parts.
I personally do not play D&D, so I'm not  a die-hard. But I did enjoy Diablo, Everquest, Might and Magic 7, and Age  of Wonders, so I'm not against "dungeon-crawl"/fantasy type games  as you may think I am. I did like the "pause" option in Baldur's  Gate, so you can give commands to each of your party's members without  getting thrashed in the meantime, but I didn't care for the graphics. But  to some, that's minor and forgivable if you like the gameplay--I guess I  just didn't. I also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline.  But if you prefer a non-linear storyline, and sometimes feeling semi-lost  in a rather large world to explore, that's all the more reason for you to  get this game.
8760	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I will never forget the snowy Xmas of 1992 when I made the upgrade from the trusty old Commodore 64 to the Sega Genesis. I got about 1 game per week for the Genesis and tried just about everything. My first ever game tho was Sonic the Hedgehog. The gameplay was simple and that's the way I liked it.
I loved the plot too.  It was just so great for me.


lenght : long, looooong quest, the main story it's about over 60 hours, 100-150 with side-quests
While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.

Diablo II is a very big, very involving and very addictive game with a lot of tasks to perform and a vast amount of weopons and rare items to be found, so anyone is going to have his/her hands full. And I am rating it five stars by playing it only halfway through! That's saying a lot.
The reason why most people would want to buy this is for FF5, which has only been available with emulation until this.  FF5, in my opinion, has the best battle system to date!  It introduces the full buffet of jobs for you to choose from and customize.  It's fairly challenging and very fun.  A must have for anyone who enjoyed the old-school RPGs.
4394	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a good RTS although it comes in 2nd to Age of EmpiresII. The races in this game are a lot more fun that those of age of empires. Also their isn't as much resource starvation as in AOE. Starcraft is also more fast paced and I think overall is a better multiplayer game due to battle.net's easy play and go layout. Overall, this is the best real time strategy you are going to get for its $20 price on amazon.com PICK IT UP!
You can set up a park in Roller Coaster Tycoon (RCT) that basically runs itself.  If you staff it well, you won't even have to worry (much) about the usual things that turn guests off (litter, vandalism, lack of facilities, etc). And what are you doing during all this? Planning expansions. Landscaping. Building roller-coasters. And it's surprisingly entertaining.
3820	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a great drinking game.  Try it sometimes with a couple of you drinking buddies, its a great game to see who can catch the biggest fish or even team up and play a tourney.  The best part is the more fish you catch the drunker you all will get.  Very fun game and another must have game for the Dreamcast system.
7212	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Though this game plays a lot like Super Mario 64 it is not quite as good.  That is because everything you do a each level you have to repeat as a different character so it gets too redundant.  It was a lot easier to beat than Mario 64 as some of those stars are very difficult to get.  There are very few in this game that are very difficult.
2511	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game.  All the same graphics, levels, and even cheats are the same.  Even if you beat the original game, this version has a few things added.  There's a mode where you race a friend or the computer, a table which has  all the Toads that you've unlocked which will let you print out banners and  such on the game boy printer, a fortune teller where if you are very lucky  you earn five extra lives, and a challenge mode where you have to have a  high score, gain red coins and find a yoshi's egg.  There is also a picture  gallery similar to Zelda Dx. which has pictures of enemies and scenes from  the game.  This game is pure fun.
4303	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	If a game doesn't hook me within the first half-hour then I'm just not going to see it through to the end. Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires: In Space to me and the slow, confusing gameplay really got on my nerves. I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments, but I simply could not get into it.


4608	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This expansion pack (EP) was a complete wast of my time, and money.  It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor, some new spells and a couple new areas to explore.  There is no plot to the the EP, just some NPC saying  "Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower. . . ." and stuff like that.  The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a  lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate, and increased Experience points  to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level.  By the way, it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you  decide to replay Baldurs Gate.  In conclusion don't buy this EP, it isn't  worth it, unless any new EP's come out that require it.

You're tossed into the action from the moment you start the game (this becomes a plot device later, actually). That made me wonder about if the game would be lacking in any kind of non-character-model cutscenes, but I was soon proven wrong: the cutscenes are beautiful, even by today's standards.
If you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time.
Overall, this is one kind of Batman game you should try out.

Interestingly, instead of picking up weapons within the level, you select five of the available weapons (two bullet, two energy, and one explosive) and then start the game, collecting the ammo as you play. You're also equipped with a default melee weapon, a warhammer. This affords an interesting strategy to picking your weapons because selecting certain weapons together can be a deadly combination; if you have the freeze gun and the inflator, you can freeze the enemy solid and then load up the inflator and shoot them while they're still frozen and defenseless, making an easy kill. The levels have power-ups that give you a variety of special abilities for a limited amount of time, like invincibility, massive damage, and invisibility. Also, as mentioned above, certain levels have special items to pick-up, such as the automated turrets and human bear traps that latch onto an opponent's foot.
Hopefully the games library will one day be ported onto the latest generation of systems.
there are also 24 mimi games or bonus stages you can play without having to play a i player game. each character has 2 different bonus stages.



That is not to say that this game doesn't have it's flaws.  For example the difficulty is set (even on easy) to where a casual gamer just can't pick this up and play.  The training mode is lackluster, and combos are difficult to pull off.  Also despite how cool the music is, it doesn't always fit the area your fighing in.  However overall it works just fine.

One of the best computer games I have ever played.  If you  like Warcraft or Age of Empires, you'll love Starcraft.  The aspect that  surprised me the most in this game were the scenario and video segments in  between levels.  Some of the best computer animated film I've ever seen.  Definitely worth the price considering how long the game remains fun,  original and challenging.

I bought this game because the second installment of the series is and will always be my favorite video game of all time.  I wanted to take a look at the game's roots and see how the previous one matched up.  The biggest changes between the two are an improved script/darker and more comedic storyline in #2, and some better voice acting.  Other than that, the gameplay is the same, most of the same weapons are used, and the same AMAZING styles of combat are used.  Seriously, the Max Payne Bullet Time feature is one of the coolest features I have had the pleasure of using in video games.  There is nothing like the rush of the perfectly executed, awesome movie-like shoot-while-diving type encounter, and Max Payne has the patent on it.

5. This game has hilarious dialogue!
The graphics seem to look much smaller, flatter, and less detailed than they did in Castlevania IV. Graphics in Castlevania IV seemed to stand out more, but that was probably because they were larger. Still, the graphics in Symphony of the Night are not bad at all, even for the year 2003. They even try to please some of us 3D die-hards with a few polygonal renderings, but there are not many of those.

  The idea, simple as it sounds, harbors with it the strength to create a fine video game experience: Lock yourself at a mansion filled with zombies and other creatures plus limited ammo, and try to get yourself out of this.

This package includes the orginal game Starcraft and its rather weak expansion pack, Brood War.  All the lavish praise I gave above was for Starcraft, but if you want to save some money, you can probably do without Brood War, as it only includes about 6 new units, which hardly changes the way the game plays.  Get it if you starve for the extra story that it provides.

This game was like a very suspenseful movie that I was controlling. Many times in the game I was actually sweating from fear. You don,t know what,s waiting for you around each corner, waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you. Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD sounds.

6397	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a very smart 'soldier sim' - less anal than 'Rainbow Six' but much stricter than 'Delta Force'. You guide a set of WW2 SAS commandos through a set of superbly-designed, 'Where Eagles Dare'-style missions, whilst being  shot at by extremely accurate Nazi guards. After a short while getting used  to the game controls (your soldiers move around realistically - unlike  other games, they don't glide effortlessly over the ground) you can order  your men around, fight effectively, plant bombs and do all kinds of  commando things. The tension is palpable, the presentation is excellent  (especially the music, performed by a proper orchestra), and the chance to  act out childhood fantasies with a captured MP40 is irresistable.
Several months later, I finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with Mario 64. I loved the game dearly back then, and to this day I still love this game. It still looks, feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era. While Zelda Ocarina of Time is similar graphics-wise, that game is so great in it's own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately.
1. It's way too difficult. You get awfully sick of hearing "Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!" every 10 seconds. There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me. "Easy" mode really isn't.  Sheesh.  I wonder what "Hard" mode was like.
Metal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new, life-like way to play video games in the late 90's.  The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding.  Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic, memorable story around it.  While I'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines, I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game, and in the process, having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2, and soon, Playstation 3.

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.
The controls are great

535	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Street Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series. Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, "Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before." Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).

  I suggest buying it
3665	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Gauntlet Legends is one of the best N64 games ever made.  " Yellow wizard needs food ....your magic is full.... poison food taste bad ." Such a classic game with so much replay value, its also great for up to 4 players at once. Gauntlet Legends N64 game came out in 1999  and is still great fun and entertaining to play 16 years later. I have spent countless hours playing this over the years and it never gets boring or looks outdated. Awesome game.
One thing that still surprises me to this day, though, is the sharpness of the game's resolution.  No, there aren't hardly any textures to be found, as Bubsy's 3D world consists of purely colored geometric shapes, but I'll be darned if there isn't hardly a jaggy edge to them.  The characters and their expressions, as well as their animations, are actually really well defined, and the 2D sprites fail to pixelate.  Its just too bad that they all live in a world created by the God of Playskool.
6036	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Half-Life:Opposing Force takes place as your charecter being Adrian Sheperd. Arian is a Corporal in the army and is being trained for a mission. That mission leads him back to where Gordan Freeman was,yet not in the same places. During the game you once again see the G-man that just  appears somwhere and stands there clamly atching,then walks  away. Half-Life:Opposing Force goes to the places Gordan wasn't. You do not  fight on Xen anymore,butyou stay back on Earth and experiance what happend  while Gordan was gone. As the coporal,you command a squad of soldiers,but  you don't just start off with them. You have to find your friends for no  apperant reason. And the so called "Improved AI" i found  nowhere. During one point in the game you ahve a medic and and enginer.the  enginer opens a door and there is a drone gun waiting. Suddenly he runs  straight for the drone gun without shooting or anything yelling "We're  gonna kick your ass!".At that point he falls down dead because he has  just been pumped full of lead. Enemy AI isn't better at all. When you die,and  die again,and again ,and again you begin to notice patterns in EVERY move  the enemy takes. I got his game for Christmas,and beat it the same day in 4  hours using the meduim difficulty mode. That is how short the game  is. Half-life:Oppossing Force isn't a dissapointment though. It's a very good  game that should satisfy anyone that like Half-Life.
837	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64. I used to play this hours on end, doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer. After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.

4164	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Grand Prix Legends can be what you are looking for if you are a fan of 60s Grand Prix, you have a good Internet connection, you only have a mediocre computer, and you're willing to persevere with sometimes incomplete instructions and downloads. My computer has the Intel integrated graphics from 2008 instead of a game card, but it still runs this game well that uses 16 and 32 bit graphics.
Some require you to actually have trained or else face a brutal whipping. Final 3 bosses each have their own "twang" to them. Especially Sephiroth who is fun to go up against time and time again. I mean c'mon, who doesn't like a cool character with a wing for an arm? Music kind of gets to you though and his 5 minute Super Nova attack gets really frustrating when he does it about 10 times.

The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them.
935	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	It still boggles my mind how amazing this game is.  I cannot even think or read about it without getting giddy.  Another Zelda game just came out-- Skyward Sword-- and reviewers have been raving about its story and art work and graphics, etc, etc, etc. But it still doesn't compare to Ocarina of Time. Not even close. I have played many, many games, and there is no question, this is still the best game ever.  No one here is lying.  It deserves every one of those endless 5-stars. There is a massive chasm separating this game from every other game fighting for second place. No other game even comes close.
The largest flaw with this game is its age. The engine doesn't allow zooming in or out. Most commanding happens through the mini-map, which can take some adjusting. However, a more advanced engine that supports Total Annihilation maps and mods has been released. It's named "TA Spring". I highly recommend that engine as well. Aside from the engine, there were no major flaws to this game. It is one of the best RTS games ever made.
SNK has always had the most colorful roster, each character distinct with their own robust (if sometimes disturbing) personality that fuels the game.  Coupled with good animation, great music, and top-notch controls (minimal learning curve) anyone who considers themselves a 2D fighting fan NEEDS this title.  King of Fighters may not be as popular as Capcom's titles, but in Japan it's still one of the most popular series around and for good reason.  KOF:DM99 continues the legacy of excellent SNK fighting games.
Replay value:9/10- Four different adventures in the main scenario definitely gives this game HIGH replay value. You can go either Leon A/Claire B or Claire A/Leon B. Capcom ,however, is not really well known for developing their mini games in a well thought out process. The extra battle game labeled "Hunk's" scenario is ok, but it left a huge plot hole in future games that have arrived on the shelf. Extreme Battle Mode was fun but the downside is, there's nothing new you can earn for the main game.
The characters are simply unforgettable. Cloud, Aeris, and Yuffie were my favorites of the bunch. Each character has such wonderful design, half realistic half cartoonish, full detailed backgrounds, and such personality and potential to develop that I enjoyed following everyone one of them.

It's not easy and money can disappear fast so don't  go crazy zoning everything and destorying things, it will cost you. It sum  this review in one sentence.

Asheron's Call does a great job in meeting the demands of the game.  For instance, if a gliche is found that allows players to take advantage of certain rules, it is fixed in the next patch.  If the world is becoming too simple for players, more powerful creatures are added.  There are so many good things I have to say about AC (Asheron's Call), I would waste your time typing them. :)

7187	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Despite the fact that it didn't catch on with the public too well, I personally thought Jersey Devil was alot better than alot of other platform games out there. If I didn't have Crash, Jersey would be my second game of choice. Sure, it had its' lil flaws just like any other game but they weren't big enough to mar the gameplay experience. The graphics were good, it was like playing a cartoon. The sound was great, all the way down to the cartoon noise effects. And, most of all, the gameplay was challenging(just like a good platformer ought to be). If you like a good challenge.....love platform games and just plain having fun, Jersey Devil is the game for you.
INTERESTING FIGHTS: Unlike most RPG's which have  thousands of fights against a huge number of unintelligent opponents,  Fallout 2 tends to have fewer, more interesting fights.  (Or at least it  can.  A real blood and guts player who charges into every situation with  guns blazing could still generate a lot of carnage.) A particularly nice  feature is the "Outdoorsman" skill, which lets you spot random  encounters in the badlands and avoid them if you want.  This means that  players who want to get in a rumble can do so, while those who just want to  get on with the story can save the time.
Samba De Amigo
Wellll, onto the gameplay.  This is where Giants really shines.  When playing as either the Meccs, Reapers, or Kabuto, the game offers three very different play styles, all of which are equally fun.  The game's narrative is tied together by genuinely hilarious in-engine cutscenes, featuring some of the best writing and voice acting I've ever seen in a game. The funniest cutscenes feature the Meccs and the native smarties that populate the island.  Both the Meccs and the smarties are for some reason British, lending a Monty Python-ish feel to the game.
Gameplay/Movieplay, it lasts a long time. 9.5/10
  I believe that, if you are going to get the most out of this game, you should play it online.  Not only because of the other people that you can interact with, but also because you can level up much faster; assuming you have someone to help you through the game.  I guess I should first explain how you go about "beating" this game.  The first time you play through the game is known as "normal" difficulty.  After you complete this, you also have to beat the game in "nightmare" and "hell" difficulties.  Naturally, these are much harder than normal; and thus they require your character to be a higher level to have a chance.  Nevertheless, there is a way around this.  You can get a high level character to "rush" your low level character through the entire game; thus avoiding the tedious and time consuming procedure for leveling up.  After you are rushed through the three difficulty levels, then the best way to level up is to join "cows games".  Basically, the designers created a "secret level" where you, well, fight bipedal cows with what look like pole-axes.  Naturally, the advantage to doing this is that you level up very quickly, as the cows, when killed, give out enormous numbers of experience points.  Thus, you can turn your low level character into a fairly high level one much quicker than if you went through all the difficulty levels yourself, killing everything and gaining experience points the "right" way.

6921	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Just kill kill kill then kill some more, find a key, and start killing again. This formula sound either good or bad, for those thinking good, its great! For those of the latter, still pretty good. I'll admit its repetitive, the stories don't have lots to tell, but they are multiple, with own powers n weapons too, just not a game to be played to beat right away. More for playing an hour or two then continue a day or two later. Still very fun kind of like twisted metal if they got out of their cars and roamed a complex. Controls are simple, grphics aren't bad, and is fun dark story, though lil of.

5026	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Back in 2002, I had never really played any kind of survival horror game ever in my life.  A friend of mine came over to my house and brought Silent Hill and the Playstation.  I was just watching and I really liked how it had snow falling out in the town in the summer nonetheless, it looked like a really scary game.  Then, months later, I borrowed this game from my friend and played from the beginning and didn't get really far because I really didn't know what to do.  Finally, one night, when my friend was back over at my house, I was playing and he was sitting there watching and we were playing with surround sound, the lights off and no one else was in the house.  From the very beginning alley, I was very scared!  So I get to the school, Midwich Elementary School, and everything looks normal.  My friend who was watching kept telling me that once I go through the Clock Tower, I will be back at Midwich Elementary and that it will be the same school but at the same time, it wouldn't be the same school and at that point, I was really starting to freak out.  I had no idea what horrors were waiting for me!
The rest of the additions are just mediocre or worse. The new character class is fun, but kinda unbalanced, and doesn't really add a lot of depth. Lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that doesn't match Diablo's polish. There aren't really a lot of new quests. One (of the two) new area is downright annoying. Some of the best features can only be enabled by editing a special file outside the game.

Polygons: 3 million per second
Fun Factor: This is not fun! For one, neither I nor my brother can beat the first level.  Supe both flying and running moves slow - if you try to fly: You'll have only ten-percent control over it! Not to mention the objectives you do are only for monkeys, you've got a timer for most of your objectives, this game is repetitive above all else, you have a health meter, a meter for all of your special abilities minus flying and you're gonna have to really try to get over your anger and impatience to beat this game!

8560	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Critical Depth came about in a time when Sony's 989 Studios took the Twisted Metal & Jet Moto licenses back from Developer Singletrac and decided to make their own versions of those games. I, like many others, was a huge Singletrac supporter back in the day. Their Twisted Metal & Jet Moto games were simply fun, addictive and challenging. Yet, when they created new games for GT Interactive in the vein of their old licenses, that's when I think Singletrac did some of their best work. That's not to say that any of their older properties weren't as good...Twisted Metal 1&2 and Jet Moto 1&2 are classics. It's just they came up with new ideas for these games that actually worked and I, personally, would've loved to see sequels to these games. Sadly, though, we'll never get that chance.

There was CTR or Crash Team Racing which is fun if you like racing, and even if you don't....but it's not about finding boxes and getting through areas like the originals.  Later there is one where you and a friend can play at once (Titans I think) and  it's my very least favorite. There is also Crash Bash (LOVE THAT ONE, so fun, super for family time! But not the same 'story line' type as the early ones.

5220	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is probably one of the top 3 games ever.  I personally rank it #1 and GoldenEye as #3.  The reason this game is so awsome is because of it's movie like qualities.  For a maximum impact, you should play this game in long stretches with as few distractions as possible.  This will litterely put you inside the movie.  The plot is just awsome, and it gets better as it goes along.  It took my about a year to beat the game, and a total of about 50 hours of gameplay.  I did stop playing it for about 6 months win I got stuck on a level, then stopped for another month when I got stuck on the last couple of levels.  I still think they should make a movie series of this game.  Overall, I think I would pay about ... if I needed to to get this game.
I played FFI, FFIV, and FFVI before this game, and on my first playthrough of FFVII, I mourned the absence of some elements included in FFVI, such as multi-party battles, and FFVI's non-linear second act, but in time, I came to realize that in terms of characterization and presentation, FFVII is the quintessential Final Fantasy game.

To begin, the size and depth of this game is extraordinary for its time. I couldn't believe it upon first play. The regions to explore are expansive. The situations that occur at each location differ depending upon your party, and events that you have accomplished elsewhere.

 1) The graphics engine is top notch.  Written by the man himself, John Carmack, it possess the best graphics engine created, up until Carmack creates his new engine.  Unreals engine does come close, but I believe the Quake3 engine would win in a "duel of engines." (I just hate the water effects in the Quake3 engine!)  2) The player models are the best.  Period.  There are models for everyone's tastes: monsters, humans, one-eyed cyborgs, the whole 9 yards.  Each one has its own animation and sound.  Very cool when "fragging" (killing) someone.  The level of detail up close is astonishing.  My hat goes off to Paul Steed, the creator of the models in Q3..  3) The gameplay is the best around.  Unlike Unreal Tournament, I feel like I'm in control of the environment.  Games for Q3 are designed for less people (around 10) than in Unreal Tournament, in which about 20 or so would work well.  It's pretty hard to explain the gameplay, but the best way to put it would be to say, "it just feels right." The control, weapon firing, is much smoother. I also like the stability of Q3 more than in Unreal Tournament.  4) The MOD (modification of the game.  To add depth to the game that was not originally added) community for Quake is the best in the business. So many great MODS are being released, with many more to come.  MODS like Alliance CTF ([...]) Quake3Fortress ([...]) and JailBreak ([...]) just to name a few, are cropping up to make the Quake3 experience that much more enjoyable!  The teams spend months adding to Quake3.  They add models, sounds, textures, and just about everything to essentially change the game.  I am, however, looking forward to more great MODS in the future.  (one note: Unreal Tournament has great MODS lined up, but Quake is the clear leader in the MOD community.)  5) The network code is top notch.  Players with 56K and...EGAD!... 28K modems will love the new code.  Obviously, having a cable modem makes the experience much better, but the game is very playable with dial up connections.

In it's time, this game and The 7th Guest changed the way gaming was to be. Most point and click games you see today are following these 2 trend setting games, but it's very hard for them to match up to what these games accomplished. It has some very tough puzzles and about the only lacking was there isn't much going on when you click on an area except for sound which is a key for most of the puzzles you will be solving. If you like point and click games with puzzles to solve, this is the game for you. A thoroughly enjoyable game that I have played close to a dozen times.
Many reviewers have already broke down the gist of the game so I will simply add my two cents to my review of it. This game brought back the gameplay mechanics of the first NES title and expands on it in every way imaginable. Top it off with the graphics and sounds capable of what the SNES can put out and an even bigger quest than the previous two games before it and you got a classic that you won't be able to put down. Everything about the game is perfect: the overall presentation, the top down perspective that showed every graphical detail of the overworld and dungeons, spot on controls that had you control Link on his quest to save Princess Zelda, memorable music tracks, incredible sound effects all wrapped up in a quest that will take days to complete (and even longer if you find all of the game's secrets.)
Gameplay: The infamous Z-Targeting system that's spawned several developers to use it in their own games. The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this. Your C-Buttons are for your weapons. B is your sword and A is your action button(Talk, Jump, Climb,etc.). You'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour. Camera is excellent and the Z targeting helps.

I know the Playstation's old graphics look dated by todays standards and many people have a problem with them, but this game is an exception because the grainy graphics really add more fear and excitement to the game.  It makes it so, no matter where you go, you're surrounded by this world of dreariness.  The level of fear doesn't let up at ALL throughout the entire game- you are forced to either get used to it or else turn off the game if you can't handle it.  I honestly believe there's nothing to be ashamed of if you can't handle it.  Many people can't watch horror movies because after the movie is over and they turn the television off, they're afraid of the silence.  Every little sound they hear after the movie is over will make them jump and yell "what was THAT!!"
And the gameplay, oh the gameplay!  You are in a fully interactive 3D environment.  After turning the N64 on and getting a file set up (after spending entirely too much time messing with Mario's face at the starting screen - don't worry, we all did that!), Mario jumps out of a pipe, and you are in a field with a castle ahead of you.  You can jump, swim, scoot, crawl, kick, punch, wall-jump.  Yo  can do a backflip even and a triple jump and a long jump.  The game is so vibrant, colorful, and, at least back in the late 1990s, simply a beauty to behold.
Try Roller Coaster Tycoon if you're an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software (but even that gets a bit dull after  a while -- it's easy to win and repetitive).

As with all great n64 games this one accells in the multiplayer department. It will appeal to people of all ages. you can choose from 3 different multiplayer modes battle championship single race.

7619	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	"Shadows of the Empire" was one of the debut games for the Nintendo 64 system, and it was a quite a debut.  Capitalizing on the huge popularity of the Star Wars series of novels, LucasArts took one of the more popular books, "Shadows of the Empire", and created a video game based on it.  "Shadows..." starts off with the Hoth snow battle where you use one of the speeders to take out probe droids, AT-STs, and AT-ATs.  From there, you play as mercenary Dash Rendar, whose job it is to assist Luke and Leia in the capturing of a super computer that contains details of the next Death Star and to battle the Black Sun crime syndicate.  The varying locales of each and methods of gameplay for each board allow for a diverse, entertaining experience.  There are space battles, battles aboard moving trains, and numerous battles on foot help increase the intensity of the gameplay.  One of the best boards comes late in the game and involves a mission to infiltrate and destroy Prince Xizor's (the head of Black Sun) palace.  The music effects are the best this side of the original trilogy soundtrack and graphics create a haunting environment of a castle that is very dark, almost fog-laden, and very forbidding to proceed through.

Battle System (score 9/10): Combat is turn-based like most Final Fantasies.  You draw magic out of enemies to cast directly on enemies, or to equip as stat buffers.  It's fairly easy to learn this system. However, drawing magic over and over again and re-equiping it constantly (and also re-equiping GFs) can get rather tedious; that's what knocks the point off the score.  Other than that, the battle system is fine.  I especially like the ability to pull the trigger on the gunblade using the R1 button; it adds a level of fun interactiveness to the battles.
Torment is based on AD&D rules and an overlooked AD&D campaign setting, Planescape.  Torment is true to its pen-and-paper roots, automating the cumbersome rules and allowing enjoyable, structured gameplay and character development.  The game is designed in the spirit of the Fallout series, Black Isle Studios' first smash-hit CRPG line, which means lots of reading and lots of interactive dialogue choices which monopolize a lot of game time.  The game uses a modified version of the Infinity Engine used in Bioware's "Baldur's Gate" series, also part of the family of AD&D-based CRPGs.

All of this brings together a game that's surprisingly boring to play.  The levels are lengthy but they aren't engaging.  Were it actually a traditional side scrolling beat 'em up it might've actually been okay, but instead it's a game where you go room by room.  But doing this isn't even all that great in and of itself as each time you enter a room you have to wait for the game to load each area.  For large stages with several rooms such as the first level of the game where enemies can knock you back into a previous room... this is going to get annoying.  The game even flashes the words "Hold on," each time you go to another area.  The music also isn't adding anything to this either.  It's kind of boring and repetitive... but it also doesn't really pump you up or make you feel like Batman.  Take, for example, how the SNES version of "The Adventures of Batman and Robin."  Everything about that game reminds you of the animated television show it's based on.  Here you've got nothing that reminds you you're playing a Batman game.
GoldenEye has a great plotline (in my opinion, even better than the movie) and long missions, which allow a lot of replay value. The graphics are a bit blurry, but that is to be expected in an N64 FPS.

Jungle Book featured some really difficult boss battles, tricky enemies, and some astounding level mazes.

Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair.

The Nintendo 64's controllers are excellent as well. They have a firm grip and are more comfortable than the Nintendo GameCube's. The only problem is that the joysticks wear out quite easily so you have to buy new ones constantly. (Especially if you play Mario games.)

  The damage and knock out works like this: With each attack landed on an opponent, their damage percentage goes up. The higher the percentage, the farther and faster each player will fly after each hit. Players can fall off the edge of the map, or fly too high and fall into the horizon.  In single player mode, you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages. You earn points based on how well you do (ie how fast you defeat all the enemies) and what you do (ie using the same move the whole stage). Eventually you can fight the master hand, boss of the last stage. Once you beat him, you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters, Luigi (Mario), Jigglypuff(Pokemon), Ness(EarthBound), and Captain Falcon(FZero Racing). You also try for the highest score.

It was a breath of fresh air for the popular franchise and was a major hit among gamers and video game critics.

Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work.

9349	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Wow. Simply put, Max Payne is one of those games that makes you sit back and thank the heavens for your PC. From the brilliant opening sequence to the dingy corridors of Hell's Kitchen apartments and subway systems, Payne promises a feast of graphic delight, convincing audio, and a wealth of gameplay goodness. The game's depiction of Max's wife being murdered is harrowing, and from there, the story just gets better. Told in snippets of pulp fiction graphic novel, Payne's bent-on-revenge theme works to perfection. The locale of NYC is genuine, down to the ambulance sirens, mailboxes, and subway location signs. But where the game really stands out is its gameplay. Although Max is a conventional shooter, it is anything but. Using the brilliant "shootdodge" and "bullet-time" techniques, Max can essentially slow down the clock and dispatch enemies, despite overwhelming odds. How, you ask? By slowing the enemy's actions (including their bullets), Max remains in real time, essentially letting you squeeze off a few rounds before the bad guys even knew what hit them. When it's all over, you'll see foes somersaulting backwards, bullets and blood their last hurrah. The game's use of Max's heartbeat to slow down the action is unforgettable, and having to use it only in times of trouble is amazing. It never gets overdone. The action sequences are too good to be true. In fact, to believe it, you'll simply have to see it. Action camera angles are done seamlessly, and Max's comments during the game keep the story flowing. Cut scenes are meticulously crafted in grainy comic book action, and the style works, thanks to the story's key elements.
Overall, this is a game that no gamer should be without.  This game  truly shines in single player and if you ever get into multiplayer after  the load times, the realistic deathmatch mode is great.

  Unreal Tournament has no need for a story. It's no-fuss interface allows the game-player to immediately launch themselves into the 'Unreal Tournament'- a futuristic fight-to-the-death. Initially you are only able to play deathmatch, but as more scenarios are completed, four other game formats are introduced. There's 'capture the flag', in which you lead a team of fighters in an attempt to capture the opposing team's flag, all while defending your own. Following that, there's 'domination', a somewhat boring format that has your team controlling as many 'point scorers' as possible in order to amass your growing total to a winning score. The most exciting format is 'assault', whereby your team infiltrates either a submarine or a moving train, or whatever, in order to satisfy a number of mission objectives, all under a given time period. Following that, you graduate on to a really hard version of death-match that provides most of Unreal Tournament's frustration.
The enemies are excellent. This game has dinosaurs that look and feel like Jurrasic Park dinosaurs. The raptors are vicious and terrifying, the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge, the dome-headed dinosaurs show up and kick your can, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is simply great. The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable. They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart.

If you make it through the cut-scenes, then you wander through the adventure stages, looking for the next action stage. Mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like "Have you searched the entire adventure stage yet?"
Please-buy this game if you have a computer-it is absolutly  necessary to have this work of art on you hard drive-you will never take it  off.
2404	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Of course anyone who owns an N64 wants an epic Star Wars game mixed with the sheer speed of Mario Kart, and this game is the baby from both Lucasarts and Nintendo's endeavors. With the Expansion Pak, Graphics look well rounded and nice to look at, and the track selections throughout the game bring that nostalgic feeling back into the air as you relive your fantasy of being a space cowboy wielding a lightsaber. Perfect for any hardcore race fan or Star Wars geek!


Crazing/Stretching- This tends to be very similar. Various walls or architecture seems to twist or stretch into bizarre angles. If you have the game drive the car directly up against a vertical wall and you'll see it. The level with the lighthouse is a prime example.


My favourite thing to do in any match, is kill off the enemy. I just love destroying everything! I'm not happy unless everything is destroyed.
Let's start with the story itself. For me it's the greatest. While it remained simple, it still manages to maintain very well entertained and makes you keep wondering what's gonna happen next. The game start off with an awesome (back then the graphics were awesome) opening/intro where you see pretty much the zombies kicking some soldiers ' ass (or eating) and completely overwhelming the humans trying to stop them. the police an special forces are killed by the zombie army. This leaves the Raccoon City's last hope completely defeated.

BAD:
I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.

FF 5 was a real surprise, and it was great to play a brand new old style FF, never before released in the US. Lots of the reviews on Amazon say that it is really a sub-par game. I have to say I strongly disagree...I think its a great FF game. If you enjoyed FF 4 and 6, I think you'll definitely like 5. The graphics and sound are similar to FF 4. The gameplay is what makes the game so good though. You can switch your characters between the variety of job classes like in FF Tactics or FF X-2, and learn a large variety of different skills, then mix and match them. It's a very primitive form of the job class system, sure, but it's still really cool, considering the age of the game. I also really enjoyed the story of the game...it was about as good as FF 4. Theres a part where you're navigating through a graveyard of pirate ships infested with ghosts and zombies that is totally classic. I would definitely recommend giving FF 5 a chance. It is old and outdated, but definitely lives up to the quality of the FF series.

The most fun you will have playing this game is trying to get a higher "percentage" of the game complete by uncovering other parts of the map: a feature Castlevania developers have used in almost every game since SOTN.  You saw it here first.  After completing the first part of the game, you are thrown a curveball: the upside-down castle.  SOTN was so revolutionary in its level design, yet it feels so natural to play.  It is the most polished 2D game ever made.

A comparison with STP is useful here: In STP I would repeatedly find some little detail and think "Well, that was cool." The artistry of that game is elaborate--but inside of a week or two of fairly casual play, I had seen all there was to see. In RCT, though, the sensation one has is of actually making a park his own, as opposed to just arranging elements that an artist has given him. (You're still arranging someone else's artwork in RCT, but the pieces are small enough tht it doesn't feel that way.)

1759	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is where the epic Resident Evil series began. The first adventure see's you tackle zombies, snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion, which is very atmospheric. Don't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes, bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it's pretty good. This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series' of games on the Playstation. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending. But this is only a minor flaw, and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation.

This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games.

First off, the graphics are  beautiful, and just the fact that the color scheme is more than just  buffalo chip brown makes a big difference.  All of the light variants, wall  textures, skins, explosions, and background textures make the revamed  Unreal engine look like gods paintbrush.  In my opinion, the quake engine  is dying, no matter how much they revamp it, and in this case, way too goth  and way too dark to see any of the other players.

2542	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The original Super Mario Brothers came out about the same time that I was born, and I think today its aged better than I have. Having not played the game in years, I was craving some Mario and decided to dust Super Mario Bros. Deluxe off; I'm glad that I did. I forgot not only how well this game transitions to the small screen, but just how many features Nintendo managed to cram into the game. There is huge replay value to be had here, which comes in the form of an additional full game, side challenges, and other minigames. While the original Super Mario Bros. was pretty challenging, the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player. The only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game doesn't fit on the screen, so you have to move up and down accordingly, which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that I couldn't originally see on the screen. I don't need to write up anything about the gameplay, chances are you've played a side-scrolling Mario game at some point of your life. If you haven't, stop reading this and go play right now. Otherwise, this game is perfect for those craving a little old school Mario Brothers action.

A main part of this game is the ocarina of time. Depending on what tune you play, the ocarina will turn night in to day, make it rain, open secret doors, or make blocks disappear, amoung other things.  This adds an important layer to the game, for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress. For instance, after spending hours wondering what to do, the idea could suddenly hit you, "Should I play Zelda's Lullaby in front of the waterfall?" If successful, the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself, thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling.

You start out as a revenant, a resurrected spirit with no recollection of your past.  You must fight an evil cult and rescue the king's daughter, at least I think he was a king, i didn't really pay much attention because the dialogue is annoying in this game.
To recap, If you want the game to run smoothly, you should  atleast have a 300mhz PII system with atleast 32mb of ram and I would  recommend getting some kind of video accelerator card (if you don't already  have one, and if your serious about performance).  If you just want to  play and don't really care about the slow speed, go with Microsoft's  recommendation about having a 166mhz processor system or higher. It will be  very slow but will work.

Level design--this is an amazing part; there is so much diversity of stages in the game, it's not even funny.  There are carnival stages where you're on a roller coaster trying to dodge closing gates, there is a giant haunted mansion where fifty-foot ghosts chase you down while you're driving a rusty old minecart, and there are levels in which you are underwater.  Did you think there were only these level types?  Guess again: pirate ships, ship sails, lava, boiling water levels, giant towers with toxic water following you up, sunken sea ships, forests of thorn bushes, etc.  I could go on and on.

You begin playing as Spidey (but can later change to Venom if you wish) and you go about tiresome duties beating up generic thugs on the streets of Manhattan. Every thug looks the same and you'll end up punching to death the same guy a billion times (more so for those infuriating end of level bosses). The crap music is the same on every level. Apparently the game has 'additional music' by some band called Green Jelly, who I have never heard of. I assume they must be some none-hit wonder grunge band from Seattle back when all that was new. And quite what exactly they contributed to the game is a mystery as there are only 2 tracks in total (level music and boss music).

  All I can say is that this game deserves at least 9.0/10 overall. With that said, I cannot understand why Jeff Gerstmann decided to give it a score lower than that. I consider this one of the best games I've ever played, and is even better than some of the newer games I've played (Gears of War and CoD4 have nothing on this game). This game is even better than MGS2 (even though MGS2 is a fantastic game in its own right, I give MGS2 a 9.6/10), and I'm currently looking forward to playing MGS3 (I'm planning to get a PS2 soon. The only systems I currently own are a PlayStation 1 and a high-end PC). MGS1 is 10 hours of pure gaming bliss!

5514	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Don't buy this game. I've been playing it recently, and although the graphics and gameplay aren't bad, everything else is, especially the cameras. When you're playing, the automatic camera angles are horrible, and I find myself often readjusting them manualy. It becomes almost impossible to fight more than two other men at the same time without dying, because you need to see them to shoot them, and therefore have to readjust the cameras; two shots later and I'm dead. Quite frustrating. Also, the game only has 4 guns, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and shotgun with little ammo, a automatic but not very powerful rifle with limited ammo, and a rocket launcher, with only four rockets. There is also C4 explosives. This does not make for very fun gameplay. If I were you, I would put your money towards another first person shooter, such as GoldenEye 007 or something newer.

As far as difficulty goes, this Metroid game is REALLY easy compared to the original NES one and the newer Metroid Prime.  It's about the same as Metroid Fusion, meaning that if you know how to take on something you'll undoubtably come out of nearly every confrontation without a scratch.

The game is for a very mature crowd  though.  I'm not saying a younger crowd couldn't enjoy it but the subjects  the touch on in about the last 15 minutes of the game might not mean a  whole lot to, say, a 10 year old.

Splitting the game into Marine, Alien  and Predator phases ensures great variety, but you feel that you're playing  three short games instead of one long one. Still, it's worth the price for  the Alien segments alone. Whilst the Marine stages are superior shoot-em-up  action with an extremely scary atmosphere, and the Predator section seems  oddly detatched (we never learn enough about the creature in the films to  care much, although the execution of his multiple vision modes is superb),  the Alien sections could be a game in themselves. Treating ceilings and  walls as if they were floors, as the Alien you have to keep yourself  hidden, and restrict your combat to quick darts from the shadows. The  feeling of power, as you cling to a roof high above your blinded,  blundering victim-to-be, is addictive, and soon you'll be disappointed that  people don't scream in horror when you approach them in real life.

But as you progress you gain pieces of hearts, weapons, swords, shields, and other tools.  The graphics are really cool, the sound could be just a tad better, and the fun is the best.

 This game is just as fun as the first one. It brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on. The controls are spot on. You can build momentum for jumps, move in any direction, and really I never had problems with the controls even in the first Crash. One thing I REALLY love about this one is that I don't feel bad when I die! This game has some really interesting death scenes rather you're forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince, eaten by lions, thrown into the screen by a two-headed fat person, or so on. When I finish the game I plan on seeing how many ways I can die:) Some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through. The boss battles are really diverse and take strategy, timing, and skill to get rid of. I must confess I found the first boss and 2 worlds extremely easy. Its not until the 3 that the game just goes "F*** this! I'm gonna make your time a living hell"! Its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what I said above. I also noticed something that first caught my attention in Wrath of Cortex. The game seems extremely open when it comes to lives. Seriously I'm not even half way through the game and all ready up to 50 almost. I guess I'm that good at playing. Im definately buying the second one.

Difficulty: 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD! I beat it barely without a strategy guide, and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS. If you beat the game with a strategy guide, you take the challenge and fun out of it. You also won't have many broken items, like controllers or TV's.

There is an operations room where pre flight recon and post op damage assessment film can be studied. Your B-17 is beautifully depicted. You can name her as you wish and change the nose art.  Let's get ready to take her up on the first of 25 historically based missions where we will come across other flyable planes.

All these games people criticize today for being old and unplayable such as the Silent Hill and Resident Evil series... give me a *break*.  You have to give these kind of games a chance so your brain and fingers can learn to adjust to the way they play, and I *promise* you'll learn to find that moving your character around is very easy.  It's all about giving things a chance and taking the time to understand the way they are.
3460	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Sega Dreamcast has a negative connotation of being a "medicore" system from its short life span, but you shouldn't let that stop you from purchasing one. There are plenty of great games that are actually worth buying, unlike its predecessor, the Sega Saturn. The Saturn is still a good system, but great games on it can cost $70 upwards such as Magic Knight Rayearth, Albert Odyssey, or the infamously priced Panzer Dragoon Saga that goes at a whopping $400! There are excellent titles on this system such as Sonic Adventure 1-2, Evolution 1-2, Grandia II, Skies of Arcadia, and quite a few more. Sure, it was not able to compete with the Gamecube, Xbox and PS2, due to financial trouble on Sega's part from poor sales of its predecessors, but is a plethora of great games worth playing on this system, and they are reasonably priced, since they had good print runs, despite the system itself being short-lived. The VMU was quite innovative for its time, considering that it can tell you many different things, such as the character's status, the amount of time spent on a particular game, and so on so forth. Though its life span was very short, much was accomplished in such a short amount of time, releasing games that were quite ahead of its time as they always had. Though this console never had the same level of success as its competitors, its worth picking up for its price, as it still has quite a bit to offer.

This was the sort of reaction many long-term series fans gave Konami circa 1997-1998, when they first attempted to bring the Castlevania series into a 3D world on the N64. It wasn't a much better reception a few years later either when Lament Of Innocence & Curse Of Darkness both arrived on the PS2. Even though the rest of the world opted to go into 3D gaming because it was "the cool new thing" back in the 90s, few companies such as Konami & Capcom stuck to their guns and kept pumping out some amazing new (new at the time) 32-bit generation 2D titles... and the mighty Symphony Of The Night stood as the proud flagship and proof that 2D gaming is here to stay, no matter what the trends are.
Do I recommend Final Doom for PS1? Yes, I do. So order it now while supplies last, or be "doomed" forever!

It was an excellent alternative to the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games that dominated the arcade scene. While it did not have as many characters or stages as other fighting games, it made up for it with stunning graphics, excellent music, a roster of good characters and deep gameplay that made you want to master each character. Then in 1995, Rare released Killer Instinct for the SNES shocking and surprising gamers at the same time.

I think the Atari 2600's system is more advanced than this game. I mean, what's an RPG without scantly clad women? This RPG has none, except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is. And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail, and I don't see why people want them in Smash Brothers, which is a crap game as well. The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach, who is called Toadstool for whatever reason, but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars. Whatever. And the battle system is awful as well. I mean, timed hits?
Applied the latest patch (v1.06) to correct allot of the bugs and CTD, and still have the above problems.
The gameplay. If you have never played a Kirby game before let me explain the basics of most Kirby games. In most games you control a pink little ball that can steal the enemies power ups or use the enemies as ammo. In this game you can still use the enemies as ammo but you can not steal their abilities. You can jump for as long as the heart desires by gasping in a breath of air. All the enemies are silly and the bosses are quite easy and have a pattern to them. That is one flaw to this game. It's easy. you can beat it in one sitting. This might be one of the easiest games that has a famous Nintendo protagonist is it. But it is entertaining and worth the price of admission.

Granted yes, this game was released when Shaquille was really, really big in the mainstream, but after this game, notice how things started to go bad for him. After all, he did KA-ZAAM.

There is also a move I love to do that is not programmed into this game. At first I thought it was a glitch on the SNES version, but I can execute the same move on the Arcade machine. It's a move Razor Ramon does where you tie-up with your opponent (F-F-Triangle), you then hold the down direction and tap square about 4 times then hit Trinagle and Razor will stop the multiple swiping, grab the opponents and do a pile driver that flies sky high into the air.

It is improved from the original in several ways including being able to attack both behind and in front of the player with one move. The graphics are a lot better and the attack range has improved. The there is a more variety of enemies with varying difficulties and better stage layout. It's not as easy to fall to your death accidentally in this game. The life bar takes more damage to go down than in the orignal as well. The powers can be used at different levels depending on how the player wants it. In the original, when you use the magic, it was all used up.

Really though, this is THE fighter for Genesis.  The game has four different characters, Max the wrestler who is slow but very powerful, Skate the little kid who is fast, Adam ex-cop who is in the middle towards strength, and Blaze (the aforementioned hottie) ex-cop who is middle of the road leaning towards speed.  I generally played as her because she was fast enough to avoid enemies while being stronger than Skate.

One Age of Empires, as originally designed, was never meant to be the huge slug fest that it ultimately turned into.  The icons on the map were meant to be just that; icons representing single armies.  But the players demanded more, and a patch was released allowing multiple units to be manifested on the map.  Result, that icon that was supposed to represent an army suddenly became a single unit in the army.

2645	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this color, Teal, because I liked teal very much. Other than that, this console has improved on its graphics! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver, the graphics are much better! Also, there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on. Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you're playing Pokemon [It doesn't matter which one], you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket, It's very blurry. Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color. It's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldn't see before. I also have some regular gameboy games that aren't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color, they show little color, but no blurryness. Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game. There are two types, there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY, which you can't use on the other gameboys. The second type just says that it's for gameboy color. Those you can play on the regular gameboys. It won't show any color but at least you can play it. There are a couple faults for the gameboy color. One of which is that the console is too small [for me I have big fingers so it's hard for a grown up kid]. A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out.]. The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours! This only lastes me for about 12. Well I can see why because of all the good color and good graphics. So my point is that this color gameboy, teal, is a good color to get [if you like it]. The console is worth the money too. It all combines. The color, graphics, games, to make a great system!

3627	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Okay, so you've heard SEGA has ceased its Dreamcast production. You're probably discouraged from buying the DC because you are afraid that there won't be any new games to play in the future.  If you think that, you're wrong.  Sega's announcement on their permanent halt to producing more DC consoles have actually helped us customers.  Most important, the console price dropped ...--quite affordable to almost everyone.

- The buttons are laid out *perfectly* on the Playstation controller.  The target button is really easy to use.  You can use the directional pad to move it around and locate the enemy.  It never fails. The shoot button works great.  The jump and duck buttons work great.  EVERYTHING works great!  When you aim at something before shooting, it actually works.  It's amazing how many games get this wrong and the whole experience is ruined.  The play control is a major improvement compared to Syphon Filter, for example.

5257	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	A friend let me borrow the game and I was amazed.  I requires a heck of a lot of strategy.  I am still waiting for a game like this for my PS2.  This is the only game that got me away from play Madden 2001.  Basically you go threw a bunch of missions so you can destroy metal gear, which is a nuclear weapon.  The game not only includes killing and adventure, but also tries to teach you about the nuclear weapons and power.  I think getting this game for ... is a steal.  If you have never played it definitely buy it and play it on normal or hard mode.  It will waste the adventure to play it on easy.  It took me around a month to beat, playing it about 2 hours a day.  Only negative is that there is a lot of talking in the game.
There is an excellent strategy guide available for it (The Official Nintendo Power one)
gamers, and there are plenty of environmental varieties such as an ice lake, a desert, forest, and a steppe. Aside from the controls
 For starters, the graphics are VASTLY superior to the first-generation visuals of the previous game. The character models are much more detailed, the still-screen environments are more vibrant (but dark and pale enough to convey the game's atmosphere), and the crappy B-movie quality intro of the original is gone in place of excellent CG movies. The characters and monsters, while still somewhat blocky, are all brought to life much better now with numerous animations, such as head tracking, and physical gestures during cutscenes. Also, when your character takes damage, you can now tell how hurt they are by the way they walk. If they hold onto their side and limp on one foot, you know that they're close to death. In addition, the newer game engine allows many more creatures to be in the area at one time, like when you stumble into a room with 7 zombies.
9517	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Battletoads in Battlemaniacs was an extremely difficult game (ex: the Cool Boarders level, the Snake Board and the Rocket Rollercoaster level). Seriously, when I first started this game, a couple of parts were nearly impossible. What made it worse was that there was nothing you could do about it besides get better and let's face it, that should be the payoff from playing most video games right?
I won't rehash everything about the game, but I believe it is important to try and recapture the feeling of the first time playing the game. It's pretty difficult to describe. The music is perfectly eery and sets the tone grandly with stringed arrangements you would hear in a suspenseful terror film. You walk around trying to find clues about what is going on in this strange mansion. Bizarre zombie creatures roam around desperately seeking to sink their teeth into your fresh blood, you try and find better guns to deal with these creatures, and you also try and find the keys to unlock the doors without knowing what terror lurks on the other side. On top of that, the seemingly haunted mansion has traps and strange puzzles that must be solved in order to continue finding your way closer to the end of the game, almost like a spooky mansion in a murder mystery. Horribly mutated dogs crash through windows when you least expect it, and the ammunition in the game is in a very limited supply, so you are forced to make snap decisions whether to stand and fight or run for safety. Scattered throughout the game are personal correspondence, diaries, and logs that reading will give you a clue to the ultimate mystery surrounding what the hell is going on.
i even had a gameshark for it that you plugged into the controller. i didn't per say like the controller to much (the xbox seems to have modified the sega's controller a lil' bit, especiall considering the fact that the original xbox had memory units you plugged into the controller itself just like the dreamcast controller) the visual memory unit was probaby the best and is still the best memory card ever made in my opinion on any system from any year. the fact you can save and still play those games on it that you save is just amazing. no system has done that before and to tell you the truth probably never will since they all seemed to use hard drives now.

It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well.

I just finished the second world, and this will probably end up being my least favorite of the DKC trilogy - Kiddy's mechanics are tough to grasp, but Dixie's are easy (I've already played DKC2 so I'm familiar with her). I'm not really fond of Ellie, I think she replaced Rambi (who I LOVE), but I see that Squawks, Squitter, and Enguarde are back from DKC2, so that's good. A slight pet peeve is that the barrel blasting sounds are different, noticeably longer. Also slightly peeved that the bees (I think they're called Buzzers?) have a different design, they look more mechanical.

Seriously this game sucks, the graphics were great for the 16-BIT, the sound isn't all that bad, and that's were it stops. The gameplay is full of glitches and other issues. There is no blood, though you'll see a lot of sweat, maybe some tears, but no blood. You can't leave that out of the deal, also the game was just censored to death. The combination of the bad gameplay, and lack of originality that should have come from the arcades killed this version!

Man, those were fun days.
The graphics are indeed stunning, but  the beauty of Homeworld is GAMEPLAY.  In a day when most RTS are rehashed  Warcraft or C&C, Relic has created a game that truly feels like it's  happening in space.  Epic starship battles happen at your fingertips, and  brilliant in-game cutscenes and plot twists help move the game along  without a break in the immersion.  This game was so awesome, I was too  intimidated to play it when I first got it.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have  a winner.
One of the coolest aspects of this game is its characters.  There is a huge variety to choose from, and each is played differently than the next.  At the same time though, none of the characters really seem silly or out of place, except perhaps Rainbow Mika...  That's a matter of opinion I guess.
You get frusterated when you lose, you realize this isn't some easy game  you can breeze through, its actually difficult - appreciate that challenge because challenge is hard to come by in games these days.

I have also never played a video game with such an atmospheric and amazing musical score as well. It really brings out the atmosphere in this game. Whether you're in the jungle, deep in the caverns, or swimming with the fishes, there's always a suiting soundtrack to each level.

Just look at the difference between this game, and the original Super Mario Bros. for NES.  My gosh, the difference is astounding.  It's amazing how Nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades.  Sometimes I love progress.

This was the first installment of the newly revived series and it was a MUST NEED and still is. I would definately recommend this series to anyone and for those of us Triple Crowners (own the PS2, X-Box and Gamecube), I would definately stop all of the other games I was doing when the next installment of the Donky Kong series came to the home system. But for now, get this one and play the hell out of it!

- Even though this Genesis version has more sound effects, some of the ones found on the Super NES edition are missing here such as the mock laugh that purple-haired joker creature makes at the last section of Level 5, a high-pitched "bawk" when the robotic rooster is getting close to death, and Pete the Puppy doesn't yelp when you whip him either nor does he let out an intimidating roar whenever he falls off the side of a cliff and comes back to attack you.
Zoo Tycoon is a totally awesome game, too!

Dark Archon. These Swirling red look-alikes to the Archons do not have an acual attack but they do have powerfull spells like Mind-Link which converts enemy unit to your side(try converting a SCV so you can make terran units and building.), or Mealstrom which traps units in a temporary field or they can turn an enemys own energy agains them to destroy enemies instantly.
Take even the most similar games in the lot, like Galaga. It's gameplay is identical to that of Space Invaders, but it allows the player to shoot multiple missles at once, and the aliens dive toward the player's aircraft. Space Invaders has a slightly duller feel compared to Galaga.
other then that PLAY THIS GAME~


I still have my original from Summer '95.
Graphics: They're early N64, but they look alright. I don't like the fact that your main tank in single-player looks so cartoony. The comic-style storytelling is unique, and I think they're way better than PS1 Global Assault's campy voice-acting.

Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube.  Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64.  Nintendo fans are loyal.  *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo.  Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again.  They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money (and looking back, Nintendo did just that).
StarFox 64 (second favorite, play it all the time still)
However, the story does not end there.  At the third scenario,  Marine Recon shows up.  The scientists all think that they are there to  rescue them.  Wrong.  the Marines are actually there to eliminate ALL  evidence that anything ever happened, which means they are to whack both  the aliens as well as the scientists.  So now you have to fight your way  thru heavily armed Marines as well as violence-prone aliens who really,  really seem to dislike you.

Protoss, advanced aliens that rely on technology heavily.  and Zerg, aliens that are completly biological and use absolutly no robots at all.  u play in the campaign mode and go along with the story, which is not bad by the way.  however, it gets really hard in the last mission of the regular starcraft, where u have to destroy the overmind of the zerg.  then in brood war, the expansion set, the last mission is almost impossible.  the first time to beat it took me about 7 hours on that mission alone.  starcraft is a really hard game and involves deep strategic thinking in order to win.  overall, it is a great game.

6356	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have had a N64 since early 1997. From that time until late 2001, I had purchased over 30 games. This system has served me well. In late 2001, I bought a Playstation 2, but it's nothing like what the N64 (was) to me. I would spend hours a day playing Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Goldeneye, and others. And the games actully lasted long amounts of time. Sure, they didn't have as good cinamatics as the PS1 versions did, but they lasted long! For example, I beat Banjo-Kazooie in a course of a year and a half. Then I beat Spyro the Dragon in 3 weeks. See my point? So, even though I now have a PS2, it'll never, ever be anything like the N64, and even though they now have all these great new systems, N64 will always be the greatest.

A final note-- I actually enjoy the 16-bit graphics.  I am getting sick of all the games for X-Box and PS2 with hours of movie-quality cut scenes.  I enjoy playing video games, not watching non-interactive movies.

One problem, however, is...well....There's another release of this version of the game for the Game Boy, but with an added game: Super Nintendo puzzle game Pac-Attack.

The best thing in this game is the man in the market, he is always so funny!
 The GAMEPLAY is what to can be expected from a game like this.  You will be jumping and many scenes in this game for it will spook the life out of you.  I know you are saying...this is just a game....its more than that, trust me.  You basically navigate your character throughout the game solving various puzzles to gain access to different areas.  You will find plenty of ammo and weapons to help you battle the many monsters you will come up against.  Other S.T.A.R.S member will be around to help you out....others will try to block your way.  Although the controls are very hard to get used to, eventually you can compensate in many situations.  You will battle zombies, dogs, crows and the dreaded M-121A's....the Hunters.  But don't think you won't have the weapons to defend yourself for you will be armed with 9mm, shotgun's, a Colt Pyton and a fantastic Missle Launcher.
The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too.

2736	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Lunar:Silver Star Story Complete was my first foray into the world of RPGs.  First of all, I have to admit that it wasn't the chubby, badly drawn characters that drew me to the game, or even the wonderful cgi, complimenting the animation sequences, or the music, both of which are reasons in themselves for giving this game a try. What drew me to Lunar, was the thought of dragons, and the cat-like creature, Nall. That changed as soon as I got into the storyline.  Alex had lived in the small town of Burg all his life, with his companion, Nall, and Luna, a lovely young woman who Alex's parents had taken in.  Luna possesses a wondrous singing voice that ultimately gets her (and her friends) in quite a bit of trouble.  What I liked was that rather than set her up as the helpless damsel, Working Designs allowed Luna to accompany Alex on his quest to meet the white dragon.  She isn't much for fighting, but that magical voice of hers can charm, or frighten away most enemies. Along the way, we meet new friends, and new enemies.  Ultimately, it leads to (doesn't it always?) a battle between good and evil, with the sake of the world hanging in the balance! If you enjoy Ranma 1/2, Jade Coccoon, or just like dragons and cat-like creatures with bad attitudes, then this game could be exactly what you're looking for! On last note: Please play this before you buy Lunar:Eternal Blue, because this is the original game, and it might help to clear some things up.

There are a plethora of upgrades you can obtain throughout the course of the game from energy containers to new suits to be used with their perspective environments. The story is also entertaining enough, especially coming from a Nintendo game. The difficulty can be rather brash at times, but fortunately, whenever your character does get killed, she respawns in the last save point you have used.

3570	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Sega's detractors still ask  "why own a Dreamcast?They also state they're a waste of money because they failed the 128 bit system wars." I respond by saying they are pretty inexpensive if you can find them used. I recently rebought a Sega Dreamcast, 4 controllers, 5 games and it only cost me 50$. I think that's a great deal. The Dreamcast's graphics still impress even today. Not to mention that the Dreamcast's best games are also in my opinion some of the best of all time. The Dreamcast's library consists of adventure games like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 plus fighting games like Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter 4. If you get tired of playing games for a while the Dreamcast will also play audio cds and features an internet connection.  So even though the Dreamcast didn't survive the battle of the other 128 bit systems that came after it they set the bar for them and are still worth owning in my opinion.
The space chatter is also great, with some very witty lines  throughout. When you accomplish your mission objectives, you almost feel  like shouting a "yahoo! " yourself.

RE 2 has a fascinating two-disc set up. In the first disc, you play Officer Leon Kennedy, one of the few survivors of the RCPD, who has a really bad first day on the job. Leon's adventure takes him from the streets of the burning city to the police station, and from there through the spider-infested sewers to Umbrella's massive underground labs. Along the way Leon must solve numerous puzzles, obtain various keys and weapons, and blast or outrun a wide variety of drooling baddies that want to eat him.

Anyway believe it or not despite popular believe this is not the best final fantasy game. Now it is on of the best and is the best final fantasy game to get started with since its slightly easier but I would recommend playing threw Final Fantasy VI as well since after beating VII I discovered more games in the series and found that this game was a lot more fun although similar plus the story of that game completely sucks you in even more than VII does. Along with the soundtrack of VI is just as great if not better.
602	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.

Combat system: For whatever reasons Working Designs left it simple and turn based and keeping to the sprites instead of trying to make the fights 3-D. With games like FFVII, Legaia and others going 3-D this gave a lot of ridicule to the game itself, a very unfortunate thing too. It was nice for the characters to have only certain things they could do, like Alex could only use special sword attack and no magic as where Jessica could only use magic. It kept the fighting more tactical and also made everyone in the group important and not just a space filler.

As far as the game itself, Red/Blue were the flagship GameBoy games, and have become classics in every sense of the term. It is incredible how much fun and adventure could be packed into a cartridge with such little on-board memory.
-CHAOS EMERALD COLLECTING GIVES THE GAME SOME REPLAY VALUE. In the Mario games, you could collect all the secret powerups in the game, but the ending would never change. Not so with Sonic. If you manage to collect 50 rings and reach the end of a stage, you can jump through a giant ring and tackle a special stage to collect one of six chaos emeralds, which if acquired, enables a better ending.

2667	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I am confused by the claims that this joystick does not work with XP.  XP is plug-and-play: just hook up the USB adapter and plug the thing in.  It registers perfectly.  Go to control panel and mess with the calibration and test all your buttons - that works perfectly as well.  One drawback in not being able to use the W95 software is a lack of ability to reprogram the buttons - no biggie since most software will let you do the same, but I dropped one star for that reason.  XP users - don't concern yourself with the disk that comes with the joystick, just plug the thing in and get on with the games!
Another downfall was the frequency of the battles.  You step off the path on the Overworld barely a bit and you're engaged in battle.  I got really frustrated.  When I was trying to get GF Ultima Weapon, the trip down into the bowels of the Deep Sea Research Center proved victorious--I got so frustrated with the unescapable frequent battles that I gave up.  Of course, this is coming from the idiot who didn't realize GF Diablos WAS a GF and sold the freaking lamp after he destroyed her.  So I didn't have the 'encounter none' ability.  That would have made the battles less frequent and therefore less irritating, so don't go by me.  :-)
For any who want a review of the game itself:


  Graphics 7/10 fine, but not the best. The environments are well done.
Once started, your objective is simple, colonize other worlds or bring them to your cause through diplomacy or flat out invade them and then win them over with diplomacy. Just keep going until you have captured the other sides leaders and have deystroyed their base.
2) Most missions are well thought out and unpredictable
Here's the story of "Colony Wars": "You are a militant fighter pilot in space on the side of the rebel alliance who is trying to force the evil Emporer to his senses by shooting up his armies," or so says the narrational voice of an actor that sounds exactly just like James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader) during the full-motion videos (FMVs) which were made by the same company who did special effects for "Independence Day."  Sounds like a direct, word-for-word copy of the plot of "Star Wars."
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They're both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?

Keep in mind that MK4/MK Gold are the games that marked the transition from 2D MK games to 3D. So if you are a dedicated MK fan, this game is a MUST. I definitely recommend it as it's a lot of fun.
What does it do? For some games that work both with and without the expansion pack, it greatly increases the types of graphics shown during gameplay. Pod Racer is a stellar example. Play without the pack, and you get rings and blocky graphics. Add in the pack and you suddenly have lens flare, details of ships racing beside you, crucial information about upcoming turns. It makes the game play the way the developers intended.
Graphics:  i won't rate this since it's a PSone game, but they are good for their time period.
6442	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is by far one of the best real-time strategy games available. The game style is superbly unique, and even shames the classic "Warcraft II". The many different types of units, buildings, and technologies makes the game very interesting for a long period of time, and the difficulty of the missions makes this a game that will remain on your hard drive for at least several months are you purchase it. Even the experienced gamer will find "Age of Empires II" difficult, and the newbie will probably be at it for quite some time. I played most of the missions on the "easiest" setting, and they were still quite challenging and addictive.
You would honestly think that any game made by Square, in the era right after they relesed Final Fantasy Seven would have gotten more recognition than this game did, but unfortunately it did not, easily becoming an underground type sensation that few could argue, is not only one of the classic shoot-em-ups on the Playstation, but one of the best Side scrolling shooters of all time. Taking place in the all too distant future, we find ourselves jumping into the helm of three vastly different ships, which upon receiving different weapons, mount themselves on your ship in different ways depending upon which ship you have chosen. Each level is vastly different from the next, and each boss requires a methodical and increasing harder approach to defeat it, learning the patterns and timings of each boss is a must if you even want to get past the third level. With secrets galore and 2 unlockable ships (if memory serves me correct), the game is loaded to the rims with extras that will keep you glued to your tv for hours, wondering how in the hell this game is so addicting. Well in one sense the exceedingly difficult gameplay, drives you to want to see what the next level has to offer, while the actual process of figuring out the best route through each stage, while acquiring the best weapons to be used against each boss comes down to a science, and literally you have to become "One" with the controller, and basically let your senses take over, as this is probably right up there with Contra: Shattered Soldiers in terms of overall difficulty. But let me tell you the second you step foot into the final stage in the midst of an all out war against you, and only you, this game turns the world on you as you battle in space and fight off against one of the hugest RoboTech inspired bosses ever. Phenomenal music accompanies this blissful experience, as the pounding techno music even made me import the soundtrack from Japan, as I just could not get enough of the game and its music. It is unfortanate that the game never really made the waves it should have stateside, as I'm sure Square's reluctant to release a sequel, due to the games lackluster sales, but then again it just moves it right up there with Radiant Silvergun (probably THE best shooter of all time), in terms of one of those games you mention to someone, and there either like "What game?" or "Oh my friggin' God that game is so amazing." Praobably one of the best games you've never heard about or will get a chance to play, good luck finding it, and even greater luck trying to master it and beat it. Impeccable.

First, you only have 3 levels for your weapons.  It's nice not to have to power up for 2 minutes to unleash a strong attack.  Second, your dog actually has an AI brain and doesn't do annoying things like the sprite from Mana (like getting stuck behind objects every two minutes).  Third, the script is funny and gives the hero a personality; I loved the cheesy B-movie references!  Fourth, the alchemy system is superb; I enjoyed digging around for ingredients and budgeting money between weapons, armor, items, and ingredients.  Fifth, the game is difficult, not impossible, just a little harder than Secret of Mana.

The rest of the game-play and plot and story connecting is really great though. The game is going on 15 years old, and for that much time to pass and it still be just as fun (to me) as any game today, that says something.

The main concept is this: You are Lammy, Um Jammer Lammy, a guitar-playing lamb in a rock band called "Milkcan" (which also includes a bass-playing cat, a drumming dog, and a rapping onion). Throughout the whole game you are helping Lammy get out of sticky situations by playing the guitar (ex. putting out a fire, flying a plane). You are rated as awful, bad, good, or cool- and if you make it to "cool" you get to solo. You play the guitar by pressing different buttons on the control in time to the music, and there a guide telling you when to play. The songs are catchy and sometimes very funny, the animations are funny too but most of the time you are watching a scrolling guide on top of the screen, so this game is sometimes more fun for spectators.

This is the game that became a world-wide phenomenon. This is the game that created a character that is universally recognized as an icon representing all that is great about the hey-day of classic gaming! This great sprite known as Pac-Man leads the pack in the annals of classic gaming, showing one and all where our Xbox 360 and PS3 came from.

One grating thing about it is say you hit a tree.  Well, instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games, you stay bashing into the tree.  It does have some interesting features, however.

Being a long time fan of Sonic (Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, and 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Sonic 3-D Blast) I was looking forward to this Dreamcast title. The graphics are absolutely amazing, the music is great and the action is fast, furious and entertaining. However, I have to deduct a star for the occasional camera angle which somtimes interfered with gameplay. Besides that, this game is a keeper for all Dreamcast owners.

5698	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Final Fantasy VIII is one of my favorities.  It did take some getting used to the magic draw system but after I got the hang of it it became second nature to draw magic from enemies and fun.  The draw back (no pun intended) was how time consuming it can be if you are wanting as much magic as possible. It became such a habit to draw magic that when I started another ff game I wanted to draw magic.
I did try internet play just for the heck of it, to see  how it did over my yucky internet connection (I get maybe 28 kbps out in  the country) and was pleasantly surprised. There were still a number of  annoying pauses, but the game was still quite playable and I had the thrill  of actually beating a rather good player in a one-on-one Capture the Flag.  Consider me hooked!
The game is difficult at points, but is mostly pretty average.  The most difficult part of the game is probably the battle against Wiegraf for the final time.

The PROS: A platform game that didn't star Mario would normally mean it wasn't going to be good. This isn't the case with Kirby's Dream Land. From the bright and crisp graphics to the pleasant music and solid controls, this game pleased anyone who managed to play it from beginning to end. Nintendo knew they had a hit by keeping things simple for the time being and for that, it's a game that is fun to play.

Some will really test your skill (there are two in particular that only rewarded as a bonus on the end of the level target) while others are very cleverly hidden.

 Most noticebly is the controls. The controls in this game are aweful! You have no idea how many cheep deaths the controls caused me. Its the main reason why I could never get pass the first boss. This is an extreme problem when you're facing more than one enemy because the controls won't respond when you need them to. The camera doesn't make things any easier. When platforming the jumping controls and camera will often cause cheep deaths because you can't see where your going or jump at an angle that causes you to fall off.

Now onto the major flaws of the game. The main flaw is that it's not scary at all. "Shivers" is quite the misnomer. While it does involve the supernatural, it's more of a mystery than a horror game. The second flaw is that the 2nd disc was somewhat buggy. It was perfectly playable until I reached one timed puzzle that repeatedly flew by in a fraction of the time it was supposed to take. The company didn't have a solution to the problem, and I ended up copying the answer from a walkthrough just so I could barely make it through the puzzle before time ran out.
462	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.
The plot is simple - a truck with a defective nuclear bomb strapped on it needs to be detonated in a safe place. The main problem is that the truck is continuously moving at a set speed, and the slightest bump will set it off. It's up to the Blast Corps to clear it's path using a variety of vehicles. Some missions are too easy, but still fun, while others are incredibly hard. Many of the levels will require you to try them over multiple times.

  Another fact is that the camera angles are bad, but the puzzles are harder. Hmmm? Resident Evil is a very very very good game...but it is just the dialogue and camera angles...ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting, despite it's happy mediums.

The enemies in the game is where it starts to slip a bit with not too many variations in there but this isn't much of a problem as dino encounters are not all that frequent anyway. The way the dinos are presented to you is good and the ways you are encouraged to beat them is refreshing. such as guiding a pterodactyl into a fan or electrocuting a raptor.

Amazingly enough, this game is also replayable - if you do the minimum amount of things necessary to win this game, you still won't have seen everything in the game.  There are places you don't have to go, things you don't have to see, and even alternative ways of achieving the same goal, that all create reasons to play this game again.  Except those areas of the game where you can die, or get caught by the bad guys, none of that will change how the game ends, but it's still interesting to go back and look for the things you missed - you even get points for the things you do, so you can tell how close you are to seeing everything the game has to show you.  And for those of you who, like me, play these kinds of adventure games because you don't like getting killed or having to kill things, don't worry, most of that happens at the end of the game.

I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you.  This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market.  I mean, the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isn't very high.  If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force: Landwarrior.  Your time would be better spent with those games .
3687	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I played a Dreamcast.  To be honest, I'm waiting for GameCube. I don't need a DVD player, Sony. But I saved my pennies for PS2 anyway and I went to Toys R US to buy a couple of PS2 games (so that when my friends at Amazon said 'we have your PS2 for you,' I'd be ready.) While there, I played San Francisco Rush 2049. Awesome. Long story short: for LESS than the cost of a PS2 and ONE game, I got the Dreamcast, FOUR games (NHL2K, NFL2K1, Rush 2049, and Jedi Power Battles), and a memory pack. The games look and play beautifully in all their 129-bit glory. And the hockey--a first generation version, I might add--easily rivals EA Sports' game. NFL2K1, based on what I've seen of Madden PS2 at Circuit City and online, is just as good if not better. You get more bang for your buck with the Dreamcast. I may even keep mine when the GameCube comes out--that's how impressive it is.
story line:convoluted. a lot of unnessisary plot twists, although it was servicable and interesting at points. it would have helped to add characters with...character into the mix. also there was several completely unncessary scenes in it where i thought totally didn't add a single thing to the game (the cloud in the bath tub with the dude or the cross dressing game?) plus the ending reeked of don't know what to do wiht the story line so lets just say this happens.
  Well there you have it, DiabloII.  It is a great game and I highly suggest you buy it.  Not a waste of money
R4 is highly recommended to all.  It can be "won" by those with lesser skill on the "easier" teams, but even seasoned racers such as myself get a challenge from at least 1 out of the 4 teams (the expert-level DRC-team Grand Prix).  Also, note that one can finish a Grand Prix with a few 3rd or 2nd place finishes, but those who do this and think "I'm done" will never see the better cars in the game.  And definitely not the Pac-Man car...
Even with the bugs (try to avoid them!!!), this game still stands out as a great "real life" video game.

Graphics: When it first came out where good but not great and to todays standards are just to par. 6/10
Gameplay- 100/100 I have heard people complain about the poor camera views limiting the gameplay, but in my opinion, the camera views perfectly fit this game and the game wouldn't be the same without them. Sure, it would have been nice to have a first person perspective while using the weapons, but it's all the same to me. I think it is perfectly fine having to shoot enemies in a third person view, and it works better with the type of graphics that it has. When you are spotted, enemies will storm in from all directions to stop you, something that seperates this game from all others. This game gives you good reason to want to play it safe, but still allows you you have some action packed fun as well, if you want to take a chance that is. Also, this game has an incredible storyline but doesn't throw it in your face all the time. MGS2 drags the storyline on eccesively and bores you with excruciatingly long cut scenes and codec conversations. I remember using the square button to skip most of the cut scenes in MGS2. The problem with MG2 is that the storyline is too complex for the good of the game. I mean, much of it is pointless grubble and the game bores you by making you listen to conversations about crap that doesn't apply necessarily to the main storyline, making it a waste of time. This game, however, truly has a wonderful , complex storyline that you will WANT to watch and listen to. Every conversation and cut scene adds to the game flawlessly, so you will probably never get bored, although I am sure you will find yourself reading the codec conversations manually instead of listening to the people talk, since they tend to talk rather slowly and take up a bit too much gameplay.
8915	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was definately my favorite super nintendo game.  I only had about 2 dozen games for this system but I haven't played it in several years and I haven't forgoten how much I liked it.  This game looks a lot richer than most games for the snes and has a crisp sound as well.  Playing this game for me was like reading a good book.  I really didn't like the game until I had beat the first continent.  You cant judge it by its cover either.  I was looking for a game that was similar to this but there really aren't any.  The people who made this are the same people making final fantasy games today for the company square enix.  The game I believe is closest to this would have to be the first final fantasy just with more elements from final fantasy adventure which has been remade as the sword of mana.  If your collecting games for the snes this would make a good museume type trophy.

Much like the first Quake it's not a thinking man's shooter like Perfect Dark or GoldenEye, but there are some surprising elements such as the enemies that take potshots at you in their death throes. And while there's no online component, it offers a commendable split-screen experience.

The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections.
This is not to say that BG doesn't take some learning.  The manual is thick and at times confusing (particularly in how to memorize spells).  There are lots of options in BG, so you'll have to become familiar with the game interface and inventory system.  Be prepared to spend several hours just getting comfortable with how the game operates.  Also be prepared to die a lot in the beginning.
The inventory system has been improved, but is still a pain. You now have a chest in town that will hold some of your junk, thus doubling your inventory. However, the junk in there cannot be accessed while in battle. Therefore, pack as much junk as you can on your back.

So where did his fame come from? A package game for the original Nintendo. The problem is to experience on the original system you need to find a NES and you have to hope it still work. And I've never known how legal emulators are. Thankfully  Nintendo rereleased the game a few times ( Super Mario all-stars/SNES Wii, NES Classic/ GBA, Virtual Console/Wii 3ds WiiU, And Super Mario Bros Deluxe/ Gameboy Color GBA ) This might be the best. It kept the original look unlike all-stars which might put some disappointed but it is a look that can't be beaten. It add a save feature, Boo race, red coin hunt, and even achievements! This is the best singular port of the game. If you want you can also get the Nes classic version, but this is the best port on a gameboy system.

Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as Extreme Battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrellas Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claires brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called Tofu and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective its the same as Hunks mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. Ive completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Dont even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn't worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. Its funny, even though I cant understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.

I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist. If you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends 2 also avilable in playstation format.
The music and graphics sticks in my mind like nothing else. They worked so well together. From simple cut scenes to the most glorious of FMV. And unlike today's games that throw long boring FMV in just for the sake of filling 2 DVDs, this game used FMV to make a point so poetically you couldn't help but feel like you just watched an epic film.
 Bottom line:  It's a fun game and I highly recommend it! 10/10
Pros: Battles that require strategy and skills, not just dumb luck and high levels

When Diablo came out almost 4 years ago, it was the surprise hit of the 1997. One day there wasn't Diablo, the next it was on store shelves, and the day after North American productivity plummeted 25%. Although Blizzard liked to classify it as a RPG, it wasn't really one. More like an action-RPG, since so much of the game relied on reflex and mouse-clicking. The story development was slim and roleplaying aspects non-existent. Yet the simple, addictive gameplay hooked us all and had us begging for more.

The other thing that really revolutionized action/adventure type games was Donky Kong Country's boards and levels because none were exactly the same. Each board had it's individual quirks and perks and each board gave you that needed challenge that other action/adventure type games lacked at the time.
The plot of the game is as follows: You play a young man named Tomba, who after a run in with some evil pigs steal your grandfathers bracelet, set off to retrieve it. Now I'm not going to spoil it too much, ;)

The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.

6601	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Final Fantasy VI, or 3 on the Super Nintendo, was the second console RPG I played. (The first was "Lagoon" on the SNES, which was good.) I still believe that FF6 is one of the best of the Final Fantasy series. It has excellent character development, a good story, and for the first time, a villain with a background and personality. Up until this point, most RPG villains were "Mwa, ha ha, I'm Evil!!!" villains who were evil to have someone evil in the story. In FF6, Emperor Ghestalt and Kefka are deeper than that. One realizes too late that his greed has doomed him, the other is insane because he was the subject of magical/medical experiments. I have played this game six times, more than any other RPG.

This is definitely a game for mature people who  can laugh at themselves - sex (straight and gay) and drugs play a major  part in the story line.  There are twists and turns that will have you  falling about laughing, and some repellent attitudes that will sicken you.  You have to lie, cheat, steal and fight your way through pretty nasty  scenes, and delicately negotiate your way through others.  Good deeds are  rewarded (if you help out Frank in the Den, go back and visit him later  when he's made good - his generosity is a huge help), and bad decisions are  paid for (leave that Pariah dog to his own fate).  There are quite a few  chance encounters, some screamingly funny (especially for fans of Monty  Python, Star Trek, etc.) and, for a basically moral character, some pretty  distressing, where you are completely powerless. And though it's pretty  gory, nothing's funnier than the way some of these critters fly apart after  a good critical hit.

Well, Kids, Sonic is back and better than ever and now, thanks to some extremely brave and very, very well-executed gameplay changes, regains his foothold as the best platform hero in the world, bar none :-)
I'd also like to mention that when this game was released, I didn't know about it until about 5 years later. At the time, I was into Sonic and Pokemon (when Kanto was the only region!), for the most part, and I thought the new art style was as cool as anything could ever be. I didn't recognize Knuckles, though, because I'd only ever seen AoStH and a few Sonic products in stores (such as spaghetti-os). I literally thought Knuckles was an enhanced-awesomeness version of Tails, since he was the only character on the can with Sonic. I completely forgot about that feeling until this showed up in the mail after I ordered it. The box art is just so much more detailed than any other Sonic game's that I can think of (regarding resolution, at least).


What  made this game so much fun was the uniqueness of it all.  You're an  explorer out to discover the legacy of his lost father and discover a ship  trapped in the ice.  The ship is inhabited by odd spirits and dreams of  people long dead, and it's your job to find out what happened and set the  dreamers free.

They are well designed and have a anolog stick or D-Pad choice,plenty of buttons in convenient positions plus to on the back. Basically a cross between the N64 and Xbox controllers. Games:Who cares if it doesn't have as many games as Playstation! It's got plenty of good titles that it does have:Sonic Adventure 2,18 Wheeler,and Demolition Racer to name just a few. Tee Off isn't as good as Mario Golf for the N64,but it is still good. Also,Sonic Adventure has something SA2 doesn't have,adventure boards! Although this can make the game frusturating at times,it is still cool.(okay,so maybe these are the only games I've played for DC other than Sonic Shuffle,which I hate and is nowhere close to Mario Party 2,but they are still good and I've also played Wacky Races,which is a very fun and cool racing game,but is kind of fursturating at times). Another cool thing is the web browser which is compatible with the DC keyboard and mouse(and version 2.0 of it even comes with a simple yet cool game called Sega Swirl). Now as for the memory cards,there's not much to say other than that they can hold plenty of info and are at a reasonable price. Multiplayer capablity:This system has almost as good as multiplayer as PC,because it has plenty of good multiplayer games plus you can play on the internet and it comes with 4 controller ports! Graphics:They might be a bit under that of Playstation 2,Nintendo Gamecube,Xbox,or a new PC,but they are still quite amazing especially for their time(the game I've played that I think has the best graphics is Sonic Adventure 2). Pricing:amazing! This console a lot cheaper than PS One,yet it is even better! Plus it has the feature that was first introduced on PS One,the ability to play Music CD's!(but the CD playback isn't as good as other systems though). To sum it up,this is a great system with quality games,accessories,internet,.and multiplayer capablities!

When I was a kid, I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you're playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. Its more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, its just a masterpiece. Id recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and its by far the best in the entire series.

Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong have a lot of friends along the way. Wrinkly, the old monkey at the save cave is always complimenting you. Funky Kong is at Funky Rentals where he gives you cool new water equipment like motor boats, water-skis, jet-ski's, etc. And a another great addition to the game is Swanky's Sideshow, a tent where you can play games head-to-head against Cranky Kong to earn bananas and coins to earn extra lives and buy stuff.
Pros:
"Symphony" boasts impressive environments, huge bosses, multiple endings, creepy music, and more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at.  My only problem is that it's just too much for me to remember--when I'm being mauled by Beezlebub is not the time to look up the "Dark Metamorphosis" spell.  If you take the time to learn all your spells, as well as the ins-and-outs of all the Familiars, though, you won't have that big a problem.
I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.
The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer. Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives.

A few downsides I can get over is the video sequences.  A  lot of them have really bad animation.

Like I said I can get over that.

The setup is pretty basic... the Voyager is trapped in an region of space that saps power from all ships, for "harvesting" (of both technology and biology).  There are other survivors of this trap in there, including a "scavenger" base consisting of several known species, plus two major new alien races...  and then you get to start facing down the real force behind this trap.  And yes, there are Borg involved as well... you get to face them on more than one occasion.
Whether you're in first or last, those balloons do not change.  It's up to YOU to win.  This game eliminates that random chance blue shell that will end friendships.  It can be a little annoying in the sense that it really favors the best player (my older brother always won) but it's really fun.

6338	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	After the startling success of Nintendo's NES and Super SNES video game systems, they had a tentative agreement with Sony to introduce a disc-based console to the public.  When the deal fell through, however, Sony decided to create the Playstation while Nintendo stuck with cartridges for one more go-round.  The "battle" proved to be roughly a draw if you can remember back to the actual period and not just remember the Playstation hype.
I'm also SICK TO DEATH of all these complicated video games out there today that require pressing TOO MANY buttons just to make the character perform an action that can *easily* be mastered on the Playstation 1.  No, you do NOT need extreme and precise accuracy just to shoot a guy in the arm when you can perform a similar action playing a first person shooter on the PS1, such as the Medal of Honor series.
Resident Evil 2 also helped the whole "survival horror" genre gain major popularity. Before this game, the genre didn't really have a proper name. We just called them "scary games" or whatever. Also, the play control in this game was excellent, not to mention important in helping people understand how to control characters in a 3D world. The Resident Evil series might not allow a lot of room to walk around, but I don't think it's supposed to. You're supposed to get a sense of claustrophobia. You spend the majority of the time in tight hallways and small rooms.

My favorite is Holland: Field of Screams. The characters are awesome too. My favorite is Minion. One of the things that I almost immediately noticed about this game was the machine guns. I don't even know why they give you machine guns on TM 3 and 4. They don't do anything. On TM 2 the machine guns actually do some damage and debris flies off other vehicles when they are hit. It would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on TM 3 and 4. Actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on TM 3 and 4. If you want a good vehicular destruction game, you can buy any TM game, they are all fun, but I recommend TM 2. It will provide hours of fun, especially deathmatch mode.
Even though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway.  It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers.  Plus I really like the game's ending.

In fact, control's so bad that I tend to get and use the hovercraft mode or the boat mode more often than not. The only major saving grace is that the controls are 100% configurable.

Did I mention anything about all the side quests in this game? At the beginning you are fairly limited with how much of the map you can explore, but once you become more mobile, you can walk away from your main objectives and discover new places that provide you with additional quests. This is how you will get the bulk of your Guardian Forces and some other life-saving items. My favorite places were the Deep Sea Research Center, the Centra Ruins in the wasteland of the Centra Continent, and the Shumi Village in the north.
The graphics are very good and use a different technique than RE allowing for much more user interaction. In RE the graphics are made up of pre-rendered backgrounds but DC uses polygonal characters and backgrounds to better effect and look very much like the areas they are trying to convey. This style of graphics works better than in RE and heightens the tension very well.

A big problem according to people are the main characters, Kiddy & Dixie.  They say "oh kiddy's too slow and looks too childish."  First off, Kiddy controls EXACTLY to DK in the first DKC.  He's a heavy weight, moves a bit slower...but he can take out the larger enemies with a lot less effort.  And Dixie was in DKC2, we all seemed to love her there...  And as far as the "childish" aspect goes, the whole DKC series was always very youngin' friendly.  This isn't "Yoshi's Story" (N64) by ANY means!!  This game has a lot of challenge and only improves upon 1&2.  The controls and gameplay are basically the same, only with added mechanics.  My only complaint is the music on occasion isn't quite as memorable....but that's just my opinion.  it still has GREAT GREAT original tunes.  Otherwise, DKC3 holds the high standard.  Anyone who played 1&2, PLEASE!  If you haven't, play DKC3!!  And good luck completing this 100%.  A very challenging feat.

Overall, I'd recommend this as perfect for person with nothing else to do during the summer. Its addictive enough to demand frequent play, but during the school year you might lose interst.
Caveat - if you find graphics, animation or current technology very important to your gameplay experience, do not buy this game. It is over 10 years old. Depending on how fast your PC is, you may need to download a patch by Grayghost to get it to run in XP/7. But, if you're looking at old games, you probably already have patience and intelligence.

Those familiar with the Myst series will know some of what to expect: lush visuals (although in static form, no 360 rendering), a detailed storyline, fiendishly clever puzzles, much mysterious machinery, and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the game.
There are a few options that you can change for the regular game. You can have 5 hit points instead of 3, and you can, of course, change the control settings.
But the graphics and difficulty can be easily forgiven, considering how addictive and compelling the gameplay is.  In it's finest form, Intelligent Qube is a perfect example of superior gameplay over superior graphics.  This is one puzzler that stands the test of time quite well.

A must have.
The game is richly complex with numerous "in-play" options, mod's and social structures, etc that can give play variations.


And the best part of this game are the boss battles. Each boss is truly unique, memorable, and a joy to fight. You will have a blast from Psycho Mantis to the Ninja to the climatic battle vs the towering Metal Gear.
In juxtaposition against the original Diablo, Nox has a lot fuller content and a more coherent story line consistent with a role-playing type game.  Though I would admitt that the story, while just fine, is not awe-inspiring like Torment.

The PROS: For Rare to bring this game to the SNES and have it turn out as good as what Capcom did to the home port of Street Fighter II a few years before, it was quite impressive. The core game, complete with all the characters, stages and moves is intact and inside the massive, black 32 megabit cartridge. The graphics, music, sound effects and game play are worth seeing in person. The controls are very responsive and it's just a matter of memorizing the moves before you learn how to play and get better. The game will become more difficult once you raise it so prepare to fight hard. Adding the extra modes means you can get all your friends in on the action making it a fun game to play. As an special treat, Rare included a bonus music CD of the game's soundtrack and remixed tracks exclusively for the SNES version.
Please use it because I have barely used it, it just saves 10% it isn't money to me, it cost $15.00 for a year and you get 1 magazine each month. PLEASE GET THIS GAME! THIS is the best game you will have ever bought, the fact it doesn't save just adds a big bar of replay value to this game, it is the most replayable game I have ever played:) and that is out of a lot, a few hundred games..... Do yourselves a favor and lay back on the couch and enjoy Mario's first adventure on the game boy!

I really would love to play it again, and I'm sure this game is overhyped for many that didn't play it back in the day. This game had charm, great CG cutscenes, and it totally captured me in the last few hours. Some say it wouldn't hold up by today's standards, and maybe not. But I would love to play it again someday (maybe on PSN) and would love even more a remake done in HD.

In terms of graphics, Final Fantasy Tactics is fairly cute looking.  But the sprites are incredibly detailed, especially for 1998.  Unlike the PSP version the game also runs smoothly and fast.  There are also a few cutscenes here and there to show you some of the story.  Tactics also sports some of the best music the series has ever known.
the members of Foxhound are some of the most memorable in videogame history.  the first, Revolver Ocelot, a gunsling, six-shooting Soviet that sadly loses a hand during an encounter earlier on in the game.  Vulcan Raven, a giant and shaman, he wields a gigantic gatling gun and resides in a warehouse freezer where he talks to his fellow ravens.  Sniper Wolf, a sleek and sexy, well, sniper, that has a reputation for always getting her target.  Psycho Mantis, a war guinea pig and avid gas mask wearer that also has psychic and telekenetic abilities.  the leader of them all is Liquid Snake, Solid Snake's "brother".  he's pretty much just an arrogant, powerhungry jerk hell bent on world domination/ a good end boss to really get the urge to kill.  other key players include:  the legendary Gray Fox/the ninja/one of the coolest freakin' creations in all of videogame history.  his optic camo and razor sharp katana (a gun later in the game) are just too cool.  He slices up enemies like they're butter and looks cool as hell doing so.  he is by far, next to solid snake, the coolest character ever imagined.  but they wouldn't be nearly as cool if it weren't for the story behind it all, which i'm not going to get into, you'll have to buy the game if you want to know more about it.  there is also a woman in the game named Meryl, who is an army brat and snake's love interest, kinda.

You can choose from several characters like Mario, Luigi, Pikachu, Link, Kirby and many more to battle against each other until there is only one left standing.
All in all, I'm kind of saddened that Sega's console is fading but if any game whose top notch gameplay can remain an eternal tribute to the dying console, then Sonic Adventure stands at the top, shining like the brightest star in the universe.

While that may be true, most RPG's I have played seem to be derived from that say typical format. Even FFVII, as great as it may be, ultimately fell for the same format. However, in spite of this format, Wild Arms delivers on plenty of plot twists and character development.

And as for the story... Well, It won't win a oscar, but It's pretty cool.  The last belmont kicks the stuffing outta drac in the beginning of the game, then after four years of friday night poker games, and having a wench in every town... he disappears.  And wouldn't ya know it... about the same time, that fun haunted house that we all know and love as castlevania reappears out of the mist.  Richters sis, maria, puts 2 and 2 together; goes too find him.  (Apparently he owes her money or something :P.)  The half human son of dracula, whos supposed too be locked in an eternal sleep, wakes up after 400 years.  after going too the nearest tailor too get some hip clothes and a much needed bath, he heads out for castlevania as well.  Sword in hand and ready too kick booty... of course that's just the opening... the rest of the story is pretty decent.  I liked how death and allucard had somewhat of a repore.  death seemed at first reluctant too fight him, even gave him a chance too go back... but when allucard refuses too renounce his quest of patricide... the whuppin begins.  moments like these, and many others like It give some more depth too the world of castlevania.

The unanimous vote for best fighting game ever made was given to this game. Soul Calibur is indeed the best fighting game ever made.

The voicework is pretty weak. It's not so much that the voices are bad, but the actors did a poor job on their delivery, so it all sounds pretty cheesy. Having to hear it all the time during combat doesn't help.

I was kind of worried, because I had gotten some games with my system that I used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since I'm older now, but when I got this and played it it was exactly the same. Some easy levels, and some that take forever to get through, but in a good way.

1497	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Love it or hate it, Doom was indeed one of the most controversial and popular games of the early 1990's, due to its violent content and satanic imagry. Doom was among some of the violent games that were blamed for the shooting at Colombine High School in Denver, Colorado. Doom was even ordered to be banned by religious protestors. But despite all that, Doom is still one of the hottest shooting games in U.S. It's my favorite game on the PC. I play almost every day on my computer at home. I would love to own this game on the Playstation because, it is, by far, the best version of Doom ever!! I rented it from one of my local movie rental stores, and loved it. The graphics are pretty good, the sounds and music are very eerie, and the animation is excellent. And just like on the PC version, all of the weapons, levels, enemies, and cheat codes are here. If you play this game and love it, also get Final Doom for Playstation. Those who are offended by lots of satanic imagry and bloody action should steer clear.
And finally, Capcom got it right.  What's the "it" you ask?  Instead of making an entirely new stage where you have to re-fight the 8 Maverick bosses, in this game the 8 Maverick bosses are spread out through each of the three Sigma stages.

The graphics, with their high resolution textures, are head and shoulders over all the other Doom games before this. The ambient soundtrack and solid sound effects also get high marks. This game is a bit dark (as far as how bright the screen is during gameplay), there's no multiplayer option, and without a controller pak, the passwords are a bit hard to remember.

I think that it started out as a great game, good gameplay, excellent graphics, mesmerizing music and a decent plot.  I thought that this might have had potential of living up to other great Final Fantasy games like FFVI.  And don't get me wrong, I thought it was a great game, but not a great Final Fantasy game.  The same thing with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, I think they concentrated too much on creating good graphics instead of spending most of their time on the plot.  At first, I thought that this game would keep a steady plot, but it got boring fast.  The characters were basic and primitive and didn't advance enough and there wasn't much that was happening.  But why did I rate it 4 Stars then?  Because I liked the ending.  Even though I think they concentrated too much on Squall and Rinoa, I still think it had a sweet ending.  It's an okay game but for me to say it's one of the best Final Fantasy games would be a blatant lie.  I'm ready to face the facts.  I say you buy Final Fantasy IX or X and save your money for excellent games instead of decent games.
1403	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Super Mario 64 was and still is one of the best and most revolutionary video game ever made.  The game was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console.  Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi, Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs(Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDN'T SAY THAT so don't flame me!)but that's beyond the point, this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever.  When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game, it was the first game to present 3d platforming, state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you'll see in platforming/action games.  The game is HUGE!  In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many, many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach.  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game(to many, but not me)looks terrible but you gotta understand, the time this game was released(96')it was INFACT the best looking video game ever.....period...and even today when I play this classic, it still looks amazing!  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90's but even today, it is still marvalous!  The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect, the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting, words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music,it's just plain good!  The controls are also tight and well focused, I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once!  As for camera, yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good!  Audio, controls, graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay?...Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game(Stars, duuhhh)and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you've ever played!  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative, I never got bored once in this game.  It's so fun, hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting!  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect, it's not hard nor is it easy like pie(acctually I take that back, for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plot)but it just gets it right on difficulty, I don't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game(then again I never did try to get all 120 stars)and just having a great time with the game...it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I've ever had with a game and as I said before....this game is revolutionary!

3543	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When I originally saw Sega's stellar Dreamcast in action, the day it launched on September 9, 1999, I remember thinking that console gaming had finally matured and arrived in grand style. Up to that point in time, no previous video game system had the polygonal pumping power or blazing speed of Sega's Dreamcast hardware to produce the spectacular and wondrous visuals that countless people around the globe had been enjoying for years in arcades.  Though Nintendo's 64-bit behemoth, along with Sony's colossally popular Playstation were very admirable machines with extremely solid and respectable game libraries, neither came swaggering out of the corner, looking for a fight swinging as furiously, or packed a punch quite like Sega's powerful like the Dreamcast. It was a machine that was truly ahead of it's time and set a new qaulity standard in the industry that was hard to match. While classic, much lauded launch titles like `Soul Calibur', `Sonic Adventure', `Power Stone', `Crazy Taxi', `Hydro Thunder', `Marvel vs. Capcom: New Age of Heroes' and `NFL 2K' showcased the Dreamcasts impressive, jaw dropping, and drool worthy graphical capabilities, it was another launch title by Sega, `Chu Chu Rocket' that reminded the world what helped make the Dreamcast an important part of gaming history. Granted you had to subscribe to SegaNet to take advantage of this heralded feature, but now a person was not only able surf the World Wide Web with their Sega Dreamcast, using the included browser disc and integrated 56k modem, but could also play games online; a realm that was previously exclusive to P.C. gamers.  Sega's console is a rock solid and attractive unit that is pleasing to behold and was built to last a long time. The Dreamcast controller is similarly well designed and assembled. It's comfortable to handle for numerous hours, making it a perfect for weekend long gaming marathons. The buttons are well laid out on the right side and colorful, opposite of the analog thumb stick, which is positioned above the D-pad, with index finger triggers on the underside. It also has two expansion slots to accommodate various accessories like `Visual Memory Units', a `Rumble Pack' or even a microphone.  The only strange thing about the Dreamcast's controller is that the cord is connected at the bottom, but can conveniently be secured forward on the underside of the unit. The `Visual Memory Unit' resembles a miniaturized version of Nintendo's original Gameboy, with a monochrome LCD screen, positioned above the D-pad, which was next to the `Start', `Select' `A', and B' buttons.  Not only could this little marvel save vital game data, but it could enhance the experince in numerous ways too.  This could be a mini game, like `Pinta's Quest' on `Skies of Arcadia', raising a Chao in 'Sonic Adventure' or displaying play calls on Sega's awesome 2K sport games.  Sega had a smash hit on its hands with the Dreamcast, but it wouldn't have been worth anything if there wasn't quality software that took advantage of the systems powerful, cutting edge hardware that was genuinely enjoyable to play.  Luckily, the Dreamcast amassed an admirable collection of classic and beloved games to build a strong library in it's short life that proudly endures today; there is something for everyone.  The previously mentioned titles are only a brief taste of the untold hours of fun and adventure that awaits the owner of a Sega Dreamcast. Other classic platters like: `Grandia II', `Jet Grind Radio', `Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver', `Phantasy Star Online', `Space Channel 5', `Shenmue' , `Metropolis Street Racer', `Virtual Tennis' and countless other great games are still waiting to be discovered on the Sega Dreamcast. Nearly a decade since it debuted in North America, it's still thinking, keeping a firm hold of gamer's hearts and imaginations.

All things aside Final Fantasy 7 visually is probably one of the ugliest games in existence, but the story, characters, combat and track keep it still relevant nowadays for a reason.  If you're  into classics or are curious, I shouldn't be the only person recommending you FF7.
3599	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Yeah, we all know that Sega has stopped making Dreamcasts. They followed the somewhat questionable buisness formula of taking a loss on the console and hoping to make up for it with software sales. This, as you can guess, did not quite work right, and now Sega just makes software. Which is a pity, because this console is so good! I have a PS2 and a Dreamcast. They sit side by side in my room. I get, I'd say, about an equal amount of mileage out of each. Bear something in mind, though. I use my PS2 to play my original PSX games, PS2 games, AND DVDs. I use my DC for DC games only (some are imports since I have my console chipped to play them). Meaning, if you break it down console wise, I use my DC much more than my PS2. The Dreamcast is very quickly becoming the "hardcore" gamer's platform of choice, due both to the high quality of the games and the fact that it's the one console nobody thinks to get. It's every real fanboy's dream, really: An unused console that none of the mainstream press pays much attention to that has a wonderful stable of games that far exceeds that of the PS2 (at least so far). If you like fighting games, a Dreamcast is a MUST-OWN. The PS2, despite what people may tell you, is not as good at doing anything 2D as the Dreamcast is. All the good fighters are out on the Dreamcast, and they're there to stay. When Capcom vs. SNK 2 comes out, you can bet that I'll be pounding away happily on my imported Dreamcast version while everyone else boots up a PS2 to play it-and I OWN a PS2, so it's not like I don't have a choice! In fact, it'd be cheaper to get the domestic PS2 release (the import DC version is a flat $..., more than I'd pay for a PS2 game.) The Dreamcast is host to many innovative games that many developers won't risk on other platforms. Jet Set Radio, Shenmue, Crazy Taxi 2, and so forth. The system is almost on par with a PS2, and in many instances will get a better framerate. Rayman 2 is a good example of this. Looks great on the PS2 to be sure, but the DC version looks just a little better. The DC would be hard pressed to pull off something like Devil May Cry, but that wave of games is not here yet, and the games the DC has now will be good no matter when you play them. Shenmue is spectacular looking no matter what you stack it against. Don't get me wrong, I love my PS2, but I wouldn't give up my Dreamcast for the world If you don't own one and you even remotely consider yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to buy this console. Remember, once they're gone, that's it. Sega isn't making anymore after this, and you'll be kicking yourself later when you have to buy one... on E-bay 'cause you didn't act now.

As Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pokmon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pokmon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.

Definately worth the buy if you are a Mortal Kombat fan like me, or if you wanna have a pretty good platformer. It isn't the best out there, but it sure is one awesome experience.

They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town. You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses. You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal... To KILL Seperoth for all people. He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing. His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill. She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game. Seprioth is the enemy, you won't find that out until later in the game.

There are many different skin types and different skin makers, so you have to judge each on it's own merit. My controller skin arrived today, well ahead of expected delivery, just as described solid black and silicone. Fit is just perfect, and installation had no problems. Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller. I will definitly be ordering a few more later, a friend has a birthday coming up.
Replay Factor
components are there.  some games i would recommend

There are very few moves, very robotic movement. No finishing moves, lack of modes as well. Single player, YAY! Punch and kick 1 guy until one of you has had enough then get pinned. Tag team mode, the exact same, but with 2 guys on each side and Survivor Series mode, the exact same with 4 guys. That's it, that's all there is. No career mode for a belt, no battle royal, nothing. RAW was much better for the snes. Get that instead
The Character Generation is fabulous.  Not only do you get to give your character specific skills and abilities to surivive on this  foreign planet, but you get to customize their appearence.  From skin color  and eye shape, to haircut and clothing.

First of all, the games are great, they are unique, and they are fun.  Only on the Dreamcast can you play Resident Evil:Code Veronica, Crazy Taxi, Sega GT, Space Channel 5, Jet Grind Radio, Sonic Adventure, F355 Challenge, Virtua Tennis, Seaman, Samba de Amgio, Soul Calibur, or Power Stone 2.  NFL2K1 is an outstanding game, and most review sites consider it to be barely...  -barely-  ...behind its Playstation 2 equivalent.  Games like Tony Hawk, Soul Reaver, and Jedi Power Battles feature better graphics and other improvements over their PSOne cousins.  Also consider the huge titles just about to be released - Shenmue, Grandia 2, Skies of Arcardia, Quake 3, NBA2K1, Half-Life.  That still leaves other huge titles, like Virtua Fighter 4, Black and White, Phantasy Star Online, and Shenmue 2, for next year and beyond.  The Dreamcast has a great future!
Without materia, though, your characters are naked and can only attack.  This brings about small problem.  The first being that there's is no incentive to use any one character above another.  Final Fantasy VII remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks.  Every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage.  When full they can let forth a brutal attack.  Characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the Limit Level the more damage you have to take before its full.  Unfortunately, this is all that makes any character different in battle.  Materia gives them legs, but you can always transfer over anyone else's materia to anyone else.  In the long run this won't bother anyone, but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely won't need limit breaks that much to begin with.  Final Fantasy VII's pros more than outnumber the cons.  The amount of customization is great, but it still would've been nice to need one character's ability over another.

6660	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Don't be fooled by this game's relatively crude graphics. Since this is a first-generation Gameboy game, I can let that slide. The music and sound f/x are good for the GB, but what makes this game shine is the gameplay...classic Super Mario gameplay with some new ideas (traveling via submarine and airplane). The last fight (the one with Tatanga) is more of a shooter, but still this is a very fun game. A word of advice...do NOT be fooled by the crude graphics! This game is a blast!
The gameplay matches that of Final Fantasy VI (FFIII in the US), but the controller for the playstation adds a new stability element to control.  The battle system is very simple any [person] can win random battles with the clean interface.  Also, the Materia System (magic system) is very user freindly and gives the character's powers that you can almost feel you now posess yourself.
You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!

Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself. Great game...that's highly reccomended.

Blown away would be an understatement.
With a fresh story-line (at the time), new monsters, and just about everything that makes the early RE games good...If you haven't played it, it is worth checking it out.

People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.
The main game is connecting 3 of the same color. It's Puyo Puyo but with an American Sonic theme. There's a VS mode, a Training mode (Which is like playing solo in Tetris), and a Story mode that pits you against Dr. Robotnik's half-baked robots.
3.  Great high-tech tools to use,  impressive vehicles to drive and fly, creative use of everyday objects.  When you pick items up, they zoom off the screen into your inventory with a  whooshing sound.  The inventory feature is exceptionally easy to  use.
I adore history, so it was a treat to be in a scenario with William Wallace and Joan of Arc. You see the real life locations they had to fight through, and you save the day with your own activities. The locations span the globe, keeping things interesting.

2644	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Game Boy Color is the best portable gaming system around. It's made all my  plane trips go by a lot faster, and for me, that makes it worth the reasonable price. There are hundreds of games out for the Game Boy Color, and many more to come. There are games in all genres, including Adventure, Arcade, Fighting, Racing, Sports, and RPG-- start your GBC Collection with Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Tetris DX, the two classics. It's small enough to put in your jacket pocket, and the game cartridges are tiny. The only problem is that you can't play it in the dark because it isn't backlit, so you have to buy an extra light to attach onto it. But cons aside, the Game Boy Color is a great investment for hours of entertainment-- at least until summer 2001, when the Game Boy Advance comes out (which will also play Game Boy Color and Game Boy Games). But until then, I recommend the Game Boy Color to Kids and Adults alike!
3315	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Resident Evil 2 by itself was an outstanding entry in the survival horror genre. The T-Virus has taken over Raccoon City, and you play as either Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy in a desperate attempt to make it out alive. The graphics, sound, and intentionally stiff controls make gameplay a tense and often nerve-wracking experience, and the intricate storyline draws you in while throwing zombies and other bizzare mutations at you. Plus, after you finish one game, you can go back and play as the other character and experience events from their perspective. Then do the whole thing in reversed order, for up to four different gameplay experiences. And thats not counting the secret missions and other bonus goodies.
One of the original concepts behind the game was that the main character was supposed to be "non-violent", but that isn't entirely the case as there is violence of a sort.  The main character just isn't directly violent.  But this is one of the highlights of the game, not a detraction (as I, and most gamers, would normally consider it to be).  You can't just plow your way through levels: you have to think, watch, time your actions, and adapt to the challenges.  But, when you do get those few opportunities to just gun your way through a level (or fart, as it may be), it only makes it that much more fun.
Perfect dark has more replay value than any game ever created. The combat simulator is prcticaly a game of it's own, more on that later. The solo misions in perfect dark are great lots of variety not too hard but not too easy. The a.i. in the game is superb. The guards are incredibly inteligent if you shoot there gun out of there hands (you will even hear them say "Oh no my gun") they will pull out a pistol or may even go for your gun.

Storyline 4 out of 5.
CASTLE AND REVERSE CASTLE: Now if you just rush through the game without exploring all the area, you will not get to challenge the real main boss of the game. To do so you have to explore the castle throughly, meet certain conditions and unlock the REVERSE CASTLE, which is practically a reverse version of castle you play, but with  tougher enemies and more awesome bosses. I can't tell you much without spoiling, but it is not hard to do. You just have to know something.
1993	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Gameplay: You play Fox McCloud, a fighter pilot for Starfox, and you're at war with the forces of the evil Andross. It's more or less a rail shooter, but there's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game. One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear. Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game. For instance, if you defuse the bomb on one level, you go one route. If you fail, you end up playing a different level.
Those were brutally hard times for all involved with so much pain.  The parents divorced and the dad got his own house.  In the midst of that, the boy's dad bought him an N64, along with "Super Mario 64" and "Star Wars, Shadows of the Empire".  For me, this game is forever tied up into that emotionally turbelent period in our lives, because both my friend and myself would play this for hours and hours just to escape the hollowness and the pain we both felt at what was going on around us.  That, my friends, is the power of Super Mario.

2654	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Now most people will read the title and think he must talking about the game. After all this is the third game in the Alpha series. No, I called this review that because this is my third copy of Alpha 3 lol. I had the Alpha Anthology first, then I got Alpha 3 Max on the PSP, now I have this. So, why get this game. Simply put I have an arcade stick and I want to play it with that on my PS3. So, I had to buy it again in order to do that. This game plays like and dream and looks great. I am impressed at how well the PS1 handled this game. It looks like the Anthology version which I would assume is the best, just because the hardward in more advanced. You really cannot tell the difference between the two other than load times existing in this version and not in that one. Ima keep this brief if you like Street Fighter you need to own this. This really needs to be a game Capcom puts online. I don't know if there is much of an out cry for it but there should be. Its up there to me as one of the all time greats. With Capcom vs SNK 2 and other great 2-D games of that era. Its fun, its bright and viberant its just one of the best SF games ever made period.

Other Aspects: This is a first-person adventure game; you move around using the arrow-keys on the keyboard. Once you get the hang of them, you can move very quickly. The game also has a map of the ship, and certain areas are highlighted so that you can instantly "jump" to them without having to run there yourself. (When the ship is sinking, this "jumping" feature is disabled) The graphics in this game are good; the biggest problem with them is that when you move they blur for a split second. However, if there are newer versions, this might be cleared up.
Cons:
The graphical engine was very good. 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will. I like nuances, and Grandia possesses many. I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them. The spell effects were boring, however, and the FMV, while technically good at the time, just wasn't exciting.

Who would have guessed Castlevania Bloodlines is actually in my opinion at least, one of the finest Genesis games ever and easily one of the best Castlevania games ever?  I'm totally not kidding with you guys!  Talk about getting the surprise of my life tonight.  This game does a LOT of things right.  In fact it does just about *every* thing right.  It's better than all the NES Castlevania games which isn't easy for me to say considering how much I love Castlevania III in particular, and it's leagues better than the Super NES game Bloodlines is constantly compared to for unfair reasons (Dracula X).  Dare I go to the extreme and say it's possibly even a notch better than Super Castlevania IV?  Oh yeah, it just might be!  I'll tell you exactly why Bloodlines is a masterpiece below.

7504	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This is a superb shooting game with lots of realism and strategy incoprorated. Graphics are great as is choice of team-mates and weaponary. I guess that it pretty realstic in a lot of ways as your team mates get in your way, and the terrorists are not as stupid as they are on some other games - they will shoot at you as soon as they see you. But there are times when you shoot at a terrorist and he doesn't die but shoots you instead. It seems to be a problem with the game. There are lots or really weird glitches too. You see dead terrorists levitating and half of them stuck through walls and their legs hanging down through the roof etc. I find it irritating that the designers take so much care to make tyres go down when you shoot them, and different sounds when you shoot a bed or a window, but then so little detail is given to other aspects such as the lights which don't go out if you shoot them. I have never seen lights like that. "Goldeneye" has lights that pop so why doesn't this? A lot of this game is just too difficult to win at. In addition, you get a mission such as the one at the datcha where you must avoid detection -  this is really difficult. The idea is to plant a bug and a camera and leave as though you've never even been there. You can go round and shoot al the windows out and still complete the level...and no one will notice that there are windows missing, glass everywhere and bullet holes in the walls? My point is, if you are going to go for realism then go all the way, or not at all. My low rating for this game is due to the problems I have had playing it on the PC. I think it's a game with really great potential, but you end up waiting all the time while the computer makes grinding sounds which freeze your action, but while you are frozen it really impedes playability and you end up getting shot because you can't react. Unplayable due to this, and I have a powerful computer, so that's not the problem. This is overambitious for the PC market, and there are things that need rethinking to make it a better game.

Now, the sheer beauty of the visuals wouldn't mean anything if there weren't a solid game backing them up. Thankfully, there absolutely is. Gameplay-wise, Aladdin can be best described as a platformer. However, it takes more than enough deviations from the established tropes of the genre to craft a memorable experience. Instead of jumping on enemies to dispatch of them, Aladdin wields a sword to slice his enemies to bits (ok, it's not THAT graphic. This is Disney, after all), or throws apples at foes, which he collects throughout the levels. Personally, I prefer the swordplay here. I mean, who wouldn't? The apples definitely have their uses, though, and become absolutely indispensable for some of the boss fights.

The characters were developed nicely, each having their own background story which adds to your liking and caring about each of your character in your party. You can easily put 50+ hours in the game and also there are whats called Bromides to collect. Bromides are anime pictures in the game which you can collect throughout your travels-I believe there are 12 in all.
You can design your own rollercoasters, water rides, go kart rides, etc. It's a great game to get into, but just be aware that you'll want to keep playing once you've started.
The story goes pretty much like this: an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs to battle against her and her troops. pretty lame sounding, as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about 5 minutes, but the story actually picks up at about disk three (yes it is pretty slow).

I don't understand why some  people are so crushed when their "favorite" game series puts out  a bad game.  It's not that big of a deal.  For all you Red Alert buffs, Red  Alert 2 will be out soon so chill out for a minute.  There are a ton of  different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely  addictive.  Once you get the basics down ... the sky is pretty much the  limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game.  It  will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by Westwood.  The  online play is great and easy to use.  I haven't even played the single  player game because I just can't get enough of the online play.  So unlike  the other people who are saying they hate it (but they probably still play  it often), I like it an awful lot.
 The graphics on this game were absolutely amazing for their time when this game came out somewhere around in 1994-ish. While it's definately a bit dated by today's standards the first X-Men game was the best Marvel COmic video game that I ever got to play.
The bad: the controllers (even when brand new in box), it's kind of unreliable (sometimes I have to flip mine upside down with certain discs), it's loud (really loud), library is too small.

Gameplay: The ever-present annoyance for gamers and it all comes down to the Junction system. Each game has had different ways on how characters played the game. From the Esper system to Materia to the Sphere Grid, characters levelled up uniquely from game to game. VIII's different in that for one thing we don't have MP anymore. You "draw" it from enemies, getting 1 to around 5 or so spells to use with the limit being 100. While it is annoying that you can have a finite number of spells, I like the idea of junctioning them to your stats to make them more powerful or adding resistance to a certain spell or status effect.

But instead, Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party's instruction manual.
3309	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Loved playing this game when I was like 10 or 11. Bought this in college and it's still so good. But when you get older it's so much easier to beat, making it better to play all the story modes.
Now on to the game's weak spots. One bad point in RPGs are the random battles. You'd better be prepared to fight a lot of battles but you need to anyway, because the GFs need a lot of points to learn certain things, and the only way to get them is to fight, and if you want good characters, you need to fight and get experience points. But don't be fooled, not a lot of areas beside the World Map have random encounters. Another weak point is that to get EXP and Ability Points, you will need to fight a lot of fights, which can get quite tedious. But besides this, I doubt you could easily find a game better than FFVIII. It is an RPG that you shouldn't avoid, even if you never played too many RPGs or aren't extremely good at video games.
3.  Music.  This is only title other than Chrono Cross that made me buy Soundtrack.  The composer gave his best to capture the feeling of this game and raise the level.

Or how about when you arrive to the hospital?  You enter a hospital and no one is around.  Once again, everything is quiet.  It's not so scary, but it's definitely eerie, and it makes you cautious.  You think about what might be ahead of you.  You don't want to explore this hospital but you HAVE to if you want to finish the game.  You look outside the hospital window to see snow still falling to the ground, just as it was before you entered the hospital.  Not so scary, but MAYBE I would feel better if I could find someone.  This hospital is just a LITTLE too empty for me!

If you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories, I recommend not buying it because you're going to ruin some good memories. Just keep it as memories, don't relive it because you might see it differently.
RE3 did improve and add some great new features. Such as... The new "dodge" feature that really adds to the gameplay and helps a ton when your in combat. It took Capcom 3 games to finally add the 180 degree spin; which enables you to turn around quickly and run to avoid danger. I also liked the new "Gun powder" mixing feature, which enables you to create ammunition for your weapons. There is a lot of action and surprises in the game. Adding the interactive environmental objects (explosive barrels, etc.) was a nice feature and really helped in difficult situations. I did really like the outdoor environment in the game. I thought that was a nice break-away from the first two games. And finally, you don't need to press the action button to go up or down a flight of stairs.
8782	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Once you get past the beginning and figure out how to leave town  "Illusion of Gala" from then on is a five star adventure that echos "Secret of Mana" and the Nintendo masterpeice "The Legend of Zelda: A link to the past". The soundtrack is intense when it needs to be, however it is wonderfully mellow and enjoyable most often. Truly one of the great video game soundtracks from the unforgettable ~SNES~ days. If you love RPG's and I know you do or you most likely wounldn't be on this page, you'll love this game. It has now become a classic treasure to many. Remember this if your just getting started with the game, the beginning is a long and drawn out intro. Don't get frustrated it's easy to figure out just more reading than sword swinging. The battles are just around the corner and the adventure is worth all the story that wraps around it.
A lot of patience and intelligence is needed to solve the puzzles and put the clues together. A lot of reading and note-taking is required and those looking for shoot-em-ups and violence should look elsewhere.
5164	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Ah yes, the legendary Metal Gear Solid series. It was originally a classic on the MSX2 computer in Japan, but the series became really good when it debuted on the PlayStation. Developed and published by Konami with Hideo Kojima being the director and producer, this was the first game in the series to become very popular. The games ground breaking graphics, addicting gameplay, challenging stealth action and its amazing storyline heavily influenced games that would later produce well detailed story lines. It was originally released on PlayStation, but would be re-released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic, a remake on the GameCube and there was even a port on Game Boy Color which apparently got good reviews (I find that hard to believe, Ill have to check that out some day).

All in all, this game was worth its money. I suggeset that you buy it.

The Prottos, a powerfull race form a planet "Auir" armed with powerfull physical weapons and devastating Phsycic weapons.  And Finally the Zerg.

3079	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When I played this it was magic. Journey back to the mid-life of the PlayStation. No, not the PlayStation 2, the original PlayStation. Yes, to the kids who were born just before the release of the PlayStation 2 and are now reviewing FFVII against games on the PS2 and Xbox, there really was a previous version of the PS2. It was a greyish top loading CD based (yes! CD!) system with no USB or iLink (FireWire/1394 for the PC crowd). After the end of Final Fantasy games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Nintendo (yes, there really was a system called SNES that came before the Game Cube and for you old foagies among us, the N64 (Nintendo 64)) Final Fantasy finally got the 3D treatment for the first time. Or at least the characters did. The backgrounds were pre-rendered textures. That is the backgrounds weren't true 3D, they were rendered on a computer in 3D and then a snapshot of them at a certain angle was taken and slapped behind characters who were complete 3D rendered internally by the original PlayStation (remember, the system that came from Sony before the PS2). Only because the PlayStation couldn't render fully 3D extremely detailed environments by itself. Up until FFVII, which, by the way, was not the first Final Fantasy to be developed (there were other 2D (two-dimensional) offerings that only people who are long dead or are old and senile will remember, ask your great, great, great grandfather if he remembers playing Final Fantasy on his Nintin'do Entur-Tain'Mant Sih'stim back in the trenches during WWII), there was a real worry that Squaresoft (as Square-Enix was called back then) really had abandoned Final Fantasy games in favor of simple graphic demos on completely unknown systems like the N64. Not so. Those demos were actually distractions from the truth. That Square-Enix... errr... I mean, Squaresoft was readying its Final Fantasy XII demo called Final Fantasy VII on the equally unknown PlayStation (or as some Amish like to call it, the PSX). But at that time the network feature wasn't fully implemented which made for a lonely playing experience for some already lonely and pathetic super-nerds out there. But for us old timers it was a blast seeing Final Fantasy in 3D finally. However, we didn't get the demo but unfortunately we got the fully playable game. Which was great in and of itself. Because it showed what was possible with the Final Fantasy franchise which wouldn't be fully realized until late 2004 when all gamers finally proclaim in one voice "What? Another Final Fantasy game? I thought they discontinued it back when Roman caesars ruled the known reality/universe and mammoths roamed computer generated alien landscapes". Oh well, anything before Doom 3 is going to vanish from the collective memory of computer-gamedom anyway so don't play this because you won't be able to. It's just too alien an experience for today's DDR generation (oh, for those fetuses unfamiliar with DDR it's "Dance Dance Revolution" and it's what today's elderly play when their hips aren't healing fast enough).

 The Zerg are spreading across the galaxy trying to find the  next stage of their evolution, in this case it's the humans whom they plan  to absorb in order to gain psionics. The Protoss, aware of the Zerg  Overmind and his plans to infest the human colonies, dispatch one of the  greatest warrior templars-Tassadar, to deal with the threat. But when he  discovers that the humans have potential, he refuses to incinerate the  infested planets. The Terrans meanwhile are in the midst of the revolution  as Governor Mensk intends on becoming Emperor Mensk by leading a renegade  faction of humans known as the Sons Of Korhol. The game also introduces a  host of unforgettable characters like Tassadar, Fenix, James Raynor, and  Sarah Kerrigan.
It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden "secrets," which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous "medi-paks."

What are you talking about? This game is CLEARLY not even finished. Do you know how many glitches, bugs, and excruciating errors I found while playing this game? Hundreds. The sickest part? I didn't go out of my way to find them. They came to me. The character models look ridiculous, nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game, the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise's name, and you'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two. Or ten. Not only that, but the game is WAY too easy. I literally played through the entire game--story and all--in less than 20 hours. In that time, I never once died or even lost a member of my party (if you're not counting Aeris, seeing as she dies in a cutscene). And hey, if you're having trouble with something, just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls, gain infinite money and items, level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight, deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit, or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats, items, and equipment you already have. But seriously, who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once? This unfinished, broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.

For the people who are true nitendo fans this is a classic that you can add to your 64 libary. I still have my 64 and it works great so does the games, Starfox is worth a try laterz folks.
the collection itself: you get a music CD, the random battle screen is like FF7 and 8's random battle loading screen, FF6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies, has CGI cinemas, FF5 is pretty much like the Super NES (or should I say Super Famicom) version with just the exception of Random Battle loading screens and PSone style Opening Cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the USA and Square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features.
If you're an avid gamer, yet you've never played this game, then something's really wrong with you.  Pick this game up and play it 'till your fingers fall off (which I guarantee you'll do).  This game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are alive.
Instead  of the old pixel-based systems, where graphics were drawn dot by dot (and  therefore looked very fuzzy on high quality monitors), newer games are done  with actual objects being drawn. Dungeon Keeper 2 is an example of this.  With an object having sides and textures and angles, it will look crisp no  matter how high you resolve the screen. Also, objects of this type can  easily be modified to react to game events.
Confession: Back in the day, I never played the 2-player mode in Tetris, and to this day, I still haven't. Who had GameBoy Link Cables prior to to the existence of Pokemon? I'm sure it's fun, but I cannot speak to its quality.

  The player assumes the roles of Gabriel Knight and Grace Nakimura, both private investigators, in a small village called Rennes-Le-Chateau. The village is steeped in history due it being the suspected locality of the Holy Grail. Gabriel has been assigned a mission by Prince James, a wealthy businessman, whose son had been kidnapped whilst in the vicinity of the area. As Gabriel gradually uncovers more about the mystery of the kidnapped child, he concomitantly delves into a turbulent, violent world of treasure hunting, vampires, religion, riddles, shady characters and murder. It is a real pleasure to witness this fantastic story unfold, despite it being rather slow in unraveling.

At the time I thought these graphics were the greatest thing ever. The transition of Mario from the NES to SNES was exceptional. Basically, I think the graphics fit the game perfectly. Just like most RPG's you move screen to screen with different surroundings at every turn. From mountains and caves, to oceans and jungles, its all here. The character models in this game are excellent and the pseudo 3D graphic feel is really cool. Lastly, the battle animations and lighting effects are awesome.  Just look at Geno's Ultimate attack or Mario's fireball, and tell me that is not cool.  There are those that feel that the graphics are too ''kiddy.'' I for one have never understood that term. I suppose a true example of ''kiddy'' graphics would be Yoshi's Island for the SNES. Do I think that the graphics are bad because of that? Absolutely not... The overall graphic environment provides a great setting and plenty of emotion.
The Dreamcast has a reletively small gaming library compared to other systems due to its short life-span, but you can double that if you get the converter software to play Japanese games (you may also need to learn a bit of Japanese for a lot of those non US-released imports). Either way, there are plenty of gems that make the Dreamcast well worth getting. I'm still in the process of building up my library and playing through the games, but here are my recommendations thus far...

Still very popular with hundreds of potential opponents online.
There is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps. Also, Mario can pick up and throw various items, climb walls using the wall jump,and punch and kick.
My recommendation is to pick up Castlevania 2: Belmont's Revenge instead. You have subweapons, less difficult jumps, a better soundtrack overall, and weapon downgrades have been checked significantly. Pick that one up if you're looking for classic GameBoy action!

If you can't enjoy VIII, chances are it is because of it's overall story. I've talked to people who thought it was "gay" or "just plain boring," and if you feel that, then I kind of pity you. You're missing out on a great adventure.

Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games. How can it be bad? Well, besides the reasons I mention above, the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times. People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want, but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing. Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen. And the fighting is so bad (because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most.

I find this game was very well thought out.  The harvesting wall alone adds very much to the story. (A shield boundary that you can't pass.)

In Arcade mode, there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes. In Mortal Kombat on the SNES, I played well on it. In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, I was able to tackle Hard mode. In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy, I can beat Master mode, but that version of this game was too easy. Here, I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode! The game is pretty challenging, but I think if a player's good enough, he can whop through easily.

I watched my big sister play it back in the late 90's early 2000's and I was just a little kid then and couldn't fit the controller in my hands. But when I bought it back in September of 2014 and played it. I was amazed. And it had good graphics for its time and console. And my favorite part (like in any other game) was the story. It tied in well with the older Metal Gears before they were Metal Gear Solid and I loved the whole experiance. And with what I think is two different endings, it has some good replay value.
9927	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Altered Beast is a game that early on in the Sega Genesis' era, came with the system. You are playing as a character ( or characters in 2 player mode) that have been resurrected. You go through the game fighting various enemies, such as zombies,creatures,demons/ghouls,ect...As you play through each level. You encounter herds of oxen. When you see the blue ox, you must hit it to get a "power up". Your character becomes bigger & more powerful. After several blue ox encounters, you'll have transformed into a beast with powers! Each level you become a different beast. The 1st level you are the beast on the cover...A ware wolf type dude. Next level you are a dragon, then the 3rd level a bear,ect... It's a pretty basic and repetitive, yet fun game. When it first came out (on arcade and Sega consoles) it was a great hit! It still holds up pretty good for how old it is. The controls are simple. The music & sound effects are catchy. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys old school classic games,sci-fi games,rpgs,fighter/beat'em up type of games.
Final note, yes this is less game like and more interactive TV but, the game is well worth it.  For fun, there are many kinds of endings.  It's the only Full motion Video I've ever seen for PS/PS2.  If you're willing to watch a stupid overpriced movie on your PSP why not interact with this X-files game?  Some people are just never happy...  If you're an X-files fan, love movies and tv, this game was designed for you.
The heart of the game is its tactical combat system,  which is by far the best that I've seen in any fantasy game.  Maneuver  plays a big part in it:  Using your faster units to circle around and hit  your opponent's archers.  Using your slower melee units to screen your  archers from his troops.  Using the terrain to set up "kill  zones" that you can lure your opponent into.  It will take a little  getting used to, so expect to loose your first few battles until you figure  out how things work.

With hundreds of things to build there is rarely any time in the game where you don't have something you can add to your cities and civilization. Maybe you want to go for the Wonders of the World where only one Civilization can get very special buildings that give you abilities that will have you with a huge advantage over everyone else. Or you want to build great defense in each city so that no one will be able to break through and take over your cities. If you want to be a war mongering civ there are many great units for that too. From simple pikemen all the way up to nuclear missiles. Truly a test of time in every sense. A voyage that will take you from the begining of civilization all the way to the mid 2000's.

The graphics are well above average, almost perfect, sleek, well detaild,  interractive backgrounds, make it enoyable just to watch.  character voice  overs from the cast of the cartoon series, and easy to learn moves for the  most part make it a must have.  The only thing about the game i was not  impressed with though is definately the very limited selection of mutant  heros and villians to choose from.  you can only pick from  6 to begin and  have to unlock the other four evil mutants.  I havn't played long enough to  see if there are more characters but so far there's not many.  but even  with the small number of playable characters this game will surely be one  of the hottest titles this summer and beyond.

I feel that Capcom hit the nail on the head with this game as they did with Resident Evil 2... heck thus far they have done a real bang up job making these games. In closing all I can tell you is that not trying Resident Evil 3 would be a mistake... as the game has everything in it that you would need for a heartpounding experience of fun.
Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.

This game is truly one in a million that I am sure any person can enjoy, BUT, if your a Zelda fan (and have played all if not most games from the beginning) you'll notice some of the things in OOT are recycled. For example, the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda: A Link to the Past. In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda: A Link to the Past, though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there. Still for what it's worth Zelda: OOT is still a pretty darn good game, though I think the story should have been more original.

Popping- Terrain popping up out of no where. Programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog. Yes folks, that is the true use of fog. However fog in this game is under utilized. Almost like it was thrown in at the last minute.

Donkey Kong 64 is just strange.  While it's unique and atmospheric to explore a huge 3D world of jungles, caves, factories, icy caves, castles and Aztec areas many of which are obviously trademark locations of the Donkey Kong series, the problem is that the game is designed so you have to collect a LOT, make that WAY TOO MANY, different things (mainly bananas, berries, blueprints, crystals, coins and film used to snap photos of floating dancing fairies (which awards the gamer banana medals).  Let me stress again if it wasn't clear enough the first time- there's a LOT to collect in this game.  Since Nintendo made the strange decision to place so much emphasis on collecting and more collecting, that's basically all you do for 80% of the exploration.  Well besides trying to land tricky platform jumps and battle the controls and camera angles which are often times wonky, sensitive and undependable.  Where *are* all the enemies?  Other than the outside of Creepy Castle, you won't see hordes of enemies hanging out together like in the DKC series.  Basically you could very well travel between different caves, lakes and other areas without encountering a single enemy.  I can't get much replay value from simply collecting all the time.  The game needs more substance than relying almost entirely on collecting (even if the atmosphere is nice).  The one enemy I like are the ones that swing a big spiked club around since they're entertaining and inventive.  Otherwise the enemies are the same ones we've seen in the DKC series but spaced apart throughout overlarge environments.

The gameplay is superior. It would be nice if there were an option to slow it down or even pause it, but, hey, this is "Real-time" strategy--no such wussy options here. The "Holographic Interface" (the gameplay screen through which you control your troops) is actually pretty easy to get used to, and is incredibly flexible at the same time. You can get dirtside with your troops and watch a stormtrooper run past you as he fires his blaster at the rebels while a AT-ST comes traipsing up from behind.

If you think you can find a better Karting game out there, I'd like to see you find it and show me, because from my finds and plays, this is the only game that is worth playing. From DK to Bowser, Peach to Toad, this game has most of the characters that have been involved with Mario in some way. The graphics are great for its time, the sound is fun, the worlds are colorful, the idea is great. Who wouldn't like this game- at ANY age? I'm not sure, but if you don't, you amy need to see a doctor. This is the best Kart game ever, and the best Mario Kart game ever.

The storyline is immense, the characters are varied, there is a piloe, a dog type lion beast, a cat on a mog and an Ancient, unlike the sequel where everyone is a human. Materia collecting is fun, the fights are testing, the towns and destinations are varied, the world map is huge (until you get the Highwind) and the sub games are superb.

Sometimes you run into Bowser, who does something random, but never helps anyone. The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns. A true original by Nintendo. However, there is a major problem with the controls...
8373	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	The graphics are smooth and intense.  The controls, even though initially confusing, are pretty good.  I've gotten pretty far in this game as well (8 out of 10 levels completed) after playing many, many hours on this  game.
The game does have its moments; if multiple people are  playing, a clever implementation of the fastest-finger round decides who  gets to sit in the hot seat.  But frankly, I can't imagine playing this as  a multi-player game anyway; the show's format simply isn't suited to be a  party game, and this home version simply isn't exciting enough to  watch.
  One of the most underrated games in the PSX due its primitive graphic display (Making it even creepier) and game play, let us pray Silent Hill 2 for the PS2 will be more of the same.

Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.

'Ocarina of TIme' has many strong points for itself. For one, the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake.

The story is very good. There's a lot of different characters that you get to play with. It has 2 player option when your battling. The only real flaw is the graphics. But it came out a long time ago so you really can't expect it to be to mind blowing in the graphics department. Other then that, awesome game. I only played FF V for a little bit. It seemed to be pretty cool. Didn't set up the story for the game very well though. And there seemed to be some bugs in it as well. Or in my disc there was. I had to keep saving so when it did mess up I wouldn't have to start over.

It's difficult to call any game "perfect." No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes.

Things start out with The Master Levels where thirteen of the possible twenty-one levels make up the core of Final Doom. These levels are meant to test one's mettle with relentless enemy attacks and complex level design, something they do quite well. Players will find a level like Vesperas is hard to tackle regardless of what difficulty level their playing on. Still, the real attraction of the master levels beyond the challenge is the fact the player can carry their status and weaponry from level to level. This isn't possible on the PC since the data for each level is its own file, something that was purposely done so each map would be considered its own separate entity by players. Final Doom on the PlayStation proves how unnecessary this was since each level still feels like a separate experience even though they follow one another.

And even getting to Kabuto or the Reapers is near impossible with the game in its current state. With no in-mission save, and some missions lasting more than an hour, the game would be hard to begin with--but not only that, there are vicious crash bugs that kick you out of the game entirely.

It has excellent 3D graphics that really fit the game play. I know graphics DO NOT make a game, but these graphics make the game better than it would be with horrible graphics. The story is engaging and absolutely hilarious at times. The inventory system is also well thought out. The battles are fun, and are never dull. The world map is also very pretty.

By the way, I play it on the original console, and I would recommend that you do the same.

Characters (score 10/10): Who doesn't love Squall? He's quite likeable in a grumpy anti-social sort of way....  Plus he's an excellent case study in avoidant-attachment disorder.  Ha ha... Seriously, though, the characters are very well-developed.  I love having unique introspection into the psyche of a main character.  The rest of the characters are excellent, too.  Everyone has a distinctive personality and a role to play in the story; no one feels like they were tacked on at the last minute just to increase the party size (a problem with some other RPGs I've played; I'm looking at you, FF12!).  The characters are portrayed very well and you will become attached to them very quickly.

My only complaint is the controller shape is a little wonky.  Too big (and I have big hands), like the N64 and the first Xbox.  Other than that, no complaints.

3398	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Sega Dreamcast is possibly one of the greatest video game console ever created. This is the console real gamers play. It has the weirdest and coolest video games on it ever made for a console in the History of gaming. It has Blue Stinger, Illbleed, Sword of Berserk, Spawn in the Demon's Hand, Shenmue, MVC, Power stone, Soul Calibur, and many more great titles. This console had it all, fighters, rpgs, action and adventure games. This didn't deserve to fail to the ps2. It is better than any Sony console and I love the original psx because I grew up with that console first but the Dreamcast was something special. It has visual memory units that would show images when you play the game and even showed vital signs in games such as Resident Evil Code Veronica and Dino Crisis.  This console will forever be talked about and rightfully so. If Sega doesn't get back into the console industry which is as sad is it is, they'll be remembered positively for this console that should have never failed. Fake Gamers turned their backs on this console for the dvd player PS2!!! THEY TURNED THEIR BACKS ON ONE OF THE GREATEST CONSOLES OF ALL TIME FOR A FREAKING DVD PLAYER! The Dreamcast isn't and wasn't hype, it was the real deal.
Trust me, you will not regret it!
4211	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is an extreamly addictive game.  Both  my son (10) and I want to play and we are constantly trying to get the mouse from the other during game play.  We have various sim city and sim train games but none are as fun to play as this one.  I think this is for two reasons.  First, the game is not one where you get frustrated because you go bankrupt every time you try to play.  Second, ammusment parks are fun to go to and fun to build on a PC.  You can build the park of your dreams!  Additionally, the program is easy to learn, seems to be absolutely bug free and the graphics are great.  It lets you change the landscape and build various tunnels and other things that you wish they would have on real parks (if they weren't so darn cost concious).  If you like sim games or just want to try one to see if you like them, this is the one to get.  Happy building!
The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game.
Still, the weapons in this game improved a great deal! You get the standard pistol, shotgun etc... but there are improved bullets to be made, more powerful shotguns/pistols, M-16 rifles, and so much more! Also, each time you defeat Nemesis in the hard level, he gives you a peice to a gun you won't find in the game, or something cool like that. Then there is the Mercenaries game after you beat the actual game through the first time. Mercenaries is a little bit redundant, but if you keep at it, you can buy unlimited ammo, start with automatic weapons and more! This means any gun you find in the game never runs dry, and believe me, the first time through the hard level, you're going to WANT more ammo! Besides, as you obtain more powerful weapons, you can swat Nemesis like a pesky fly with the missile launcher, mow down Zombies with the Magnum, or mass-attack with the mini gun.

The first level has you go through a jungle. The enemies here are just animals that you may normally see. You can bounce on spider webs like a trampoline, and you can also swing on vines (like original Pitfall). The boss is a tiger, but it can't be killed easily. You gotta throw some bombs and shoot at it. What's annoying here is how you must jump over its pattern as it dashes across the screen. If you jump too early or late, you'd be knocked down on the ground (Not saying you'd lose all your health that fast).

You are allowed only four with Attack being automatic. I try to have one with Items and all with magic.  I give magic to the one that couldn't draw. Sharing magic is one of the pros.
Paper Mario
I'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look.  "Turok 2" is still a good-looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects.  But these levels are confusing as all hell, with the exception of the 1st one.  If we had a better story to go along with it, then maybe there'd be a reason to plow through.  But for whatever reason, Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels, and if you're stuck, you're stuck for good.

The moments are never dull and the soundtrack remains one of the most legendary in video game history.

For those of you who've been in a timewarp the past 5 years and never heard of Diablo or Diablo II, let me give you a brief rundown on both.
I love how each of the Metroid varities you come across become tougher and tougher as you make more progress and go deeper and deeper inside the planet.  The ones that spit fireballs and dart around the screen at a pretty good speed are what *nightmares* are made of, haha.
I have to say, this game is quite gorey but hey, that's what I like. This is sort of a action/horror/RPG game. It has very complex puzzles and it really works your mind. When I rented this the first time and had no clue what the hell was lurking behind me or around the corner, I was scared as hell! I played it at 10:15 at night, of course so I was prone to be scared. Wouldn't you be scared. I just got to the part with the skinless creature with the razor sharp tounge. Luckly I defeated him with the shotgun. He wasn't all that hard, but I got scared and I'll tell you why:

8110	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is without question the best Star Trek game ever made - period - and the first-person shooter aspect makes it even better. The graphics are very nice to look at (it utilizes the Quake 3 engine), as are the weapons and dialogue between the characters. This game will probably be a little on the easy side for experienced gamers, since it offers few challenging puzzles. At the same time, however, the pace is quick enough to keep veterans interested and keep inexperienced players on the edge of their seat. Very well balanced for everyone concerned.
  The biggest difference between this game and the second one is that the first one knew when and where to put the cut scenes.  The first one was very controlled yet it was just right for the gamers to really appreciate the story flow, whereas in the second one, it's just wasted use of ineffective cut scenes here and there, not to mention ridiculous codec dialogues (which literally not only stop from continuing its legacy, but killed it).  Another biggest difference has to be the ending.  The ending for the first one was really, REALLY rewarding, i absolutely had this sense of 'fulfilled, completed, satisfied, reward'  You will know what i mean.  The second one, umm,,, no comment.

Just picture this- you're walking down a street in an empty town.  It's snowing, and it's quiet all around you.  Suddenly you hear wings flapping far off in the distance.  You stop dead in your tracks.  The sound becomes louder and louder as *something* gets closer and closer to you. You quickly check all around you to try and see if you can find where that sound is coming from, but you don't see anything.  A scream is heard from far away, a demon-like scream, and then another louder scream soon follows.  Before you know it, you see giant flapping wings right above you, attacking your head.  Your instinct is to defend yourself, but when you turn and aim the gun, the enemy is nowhere to be seen.  You continue to hear flapping sounds and prepare yourself for another round with the beast.  But the sounds get softer and softer until they disappear.  You ask yourself "is it gone, is it over???" while continuing to hold your gun in the air.  Sometimes during these moments the enemy WILL be gone, other times it will trick you into thinking it's gone but then come back for another fight.  And this is just in the DAYTIME part of the game!  Imagine how much harder and more frightening this battle becomes when the sky suddenly turns dark and the enemies want to come out and play.  That's what makes the game so great- you just don't know what to expect.
By this game and see yourself how wondrous it is.
In the end, you are judged by Prof Oak, and will eventually get to move on to a new location with new pokemon to see.

If you look at the title of each stage, you will feel, almost feel that this is not just a mere shooter game, but because of that title you can almost sense the story line flowing as you go along.  I think that's really something, being able to convey the feel of storyline just with title of each stage?  You gotta play for yourself to see what I mean.

The gameplay was probably what was most intriguing in relative to Castlevania IV. Though an action platformer at heart, it adds some RPG elements; strength and other stats are quantified; you can obtain and change weapons and other equipment, and carry items for later use, like health potions (certainly couldn't do that in Castlevania IV...would've made it easier). Furthermore, your character no longer uses the traditional whip, but a sword instead.

All in all, Pac-Man 2 is a should-have. If you're a cartoon fanatic, you should pick this up right away. If you are looking for an unexpected challenge, the game certainly has that. If you are a Pac-Man fan, and wish for arcade-style action, Pac-Man 2 still offers the arcade classic and Ms. Pac-Man to satisfy your needs. There's something for everyone here!
So if you don't have the money to drop on a "next-gen" system, get yourself a Dreamcast while they are still available. You don't have to be left out of the gaming party due to low funds.



The PC version misses out on those things, but it does make up for that by having better animations from enemies and bosses.  But the controls aren't as good as the Playstation controller either (sorry, I need a controller for a video game console because that's what I've grown up with).

9103	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	My first system was a Sega Genesis, and I loved playing the Sonic series (minus spinball and 3-D, but I still got em') and other classics(SOR,SOR2,SOR3,Spiderman/Xmen,Xmen2, which is still my current fave, and most importantly: Maximum Carnage.) These games are all good and that's what made the system good to me is it's games. I liked the SNES too(for RPG reasons) but the one I was raised on (and still play today, burned songs from Sonichq.org) and still have fond memories of today is the Genesis, the only system I don't have that is Sega related is the Saturn and that is because I cannot find one,(but I will, take my word for it)so dust off that game, and play it and take a trip down memory lane cause I know I do. And you old-schoolers know no game will give you the replay value and enjoyment of a classic system like the feeling you had when Aeris died, or the  first time you beat Robotnik, these game have a value that no other can match so when you find the time to play these, do so cause in the end, these new systems may have graphics and fancy stuff, but one thing they will never have is the feeling of enertainment and gratification of a job well done. Most newer titles can be beaten in a day (some even less than that) but I dare you to play Super Mario World and try to say you can beat it in a day. That's classic gaming for ya.
The way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system. Example: Learn a small healing spell at level 5. There's no custom way of learning your attacks. You have to realize, that this came out in the early 90's, where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it. It gets the job done, but it's not as advanced as some RPG'ers would like. I didn't mind, though. Don't let this turn you away from the game. You will miss out on a memorable experience if you do.
2812	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst, and takes the Myst "mystique" to another level with five new worlds and an expanded story line.  The brilliantly realized environments and mood-setting soundtrack draw you in  immediately and keep you there until the sun comes up.  Riven is not for  gamers with short attention spans--simply navigating and charting the  accessible areas of the Age of Riven take patience and time, and solving  what I would characterize as the two major puzzles requires all of the  intelligence and tenacity one can muster.  As some reviewers have said,  having played Myst first is helpful background to have, but this is not  because the puzzles of Riven are similar to those of Myst, but because Myst  will acquaint you with how the creators conceive puzzles, and heighten your  sensitivity to factors in the environment that bear noting and  investigating.  I gave Riven 4 stars, rather than 5, for two reasons: (a)  one of the major puzzles is sound-based, and after some long and  frustrating efforts at solving it on my own, I obtained some hints on the  internet and found that the solution required matching up particular sounds  from the game that, in fact, simply did not match up (at least not in the  version that I bought); and (b) one other crucial clue is a tiny, blurry  image.  In these respects, I felt that the creators did not play fair.  Two  other points:(i) contrary to what some have said, it is indeed possible to  lose this game and meet an untimely end, so be careful out there, and (ii)  recognize that the CD-Rom version is on 5 discs, which need to be changed  every time you travel from one world to another--if you have a DVD-Rom  player, by all means spring for the DVD version, which consists of one  disc.
Conclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn't reared their ugly heads.  Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers.  Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths!  The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever!  Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it's at now.  A fond memory in many gamers hearts, this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play!

Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility.  And in my opinion, the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games (kazooie & tooie) on Nintendo 64.  Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in '98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it's absolutely amazing.  I won't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90's.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.  And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous "Banjo Threeie" to life on any console!!

"Rogue Squadron" pushes the N64 to it's maximum power graphically, which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack (I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother).  The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer.  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them.

For Tetris 2, you must line up 3 in a row using the usual Tetris shapes, as well as a few new shapes. It is a cool spin off of both Tetris and Dr. Mario. In fact, even the setup is similar to Dr. Mario. You can choose from Slow, Medium, or High falling blocks, 20 levels, and 3 different tunes.
7000	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	After I saw the movie I was in a real "X-Men" mood so I went out and bought this game. When I started playing it I became very frustrated. It doesn't show you how to do any of the moves in the instruction book (not that I ever need an instruction book to learn moves). To do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice. So to find out how to do anything with a character you have to go into this boring and frustrating training mode. Once you master a character it is then easy to complete the game. But then, if you want to play another character, you have to go back into the training mode all over again. The endings in this game are very short and unsatisfying. The good thing is that after you have beaten the game with everybody you can view each ending linked up together and then it makes a lot more sense and you get more satisfaction. There's lot of things to unlock in this game but no codes. No secret characters. The worse part about this game is the gameplay. I recently went back to play this game after not playing it for about a year. I found out that I had forgotten to do all of the moves. So rather than go back into training mode I just turned it off and put it anyway. I'll probably never play it again.
The formula overall is very, VERY unique and makes the game really interesting. Namco did a great job with the making of this game. Unfortunately, there are two problems: The lack of places to get Power Pellets AND the lack of an actual save feature. Yeah....you have to use passwords, so you better write em down..

The game is a puzzle game; it is not easy. It is not the kind of game you will sit down at and simply beat. It took me at least six hours without the strategy guide. Just for reference, if one goes through the game and does the ABSOLUTE minimum, i.e. already knows some of the codes and knows exactly what to do when and where, the game will still take about and hour and a half.

Here are the pros. The graphics are superb. The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread, and yes, the blood flow is well detailed, it sprays when you are wounded. The music is ominous and ambient, giving just the right mood to the situations you come across. The story is also well put together, even though anyone who has seen George Romero's "Living Dead" trilogy (and what horror fan hasn't?) can get a sense of deja vu. All these elements make this a game well worth getting.

Overall this game is tricky, you will die the first few times (lose all your items except monsters)  but once they are strong enough you can succeed.  There are 40 randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along.  YOu must adjust your mosnters accordingly by class.
9353	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Goof Troop for the SNES is a prime example of Co-op gameplay done right. The game is a charming top-down puzzle adventure game with brilliantly simple controls and the characteristic CAPCOM Super Nintendo music seen in games like "Super Goules n' Ghosts" and "Mega Man 7". The two playable characters, Goofy and Max, have slight differences that force you to play the game differently depending on who you play as. The gameplay is reminiscent of 2004's "The Legend of Zelda: Four Sword Adventures", clever puzzles that let you think outside the box to solve. There is a nice difficulty curve that gently eases you in with simple puzzles and later in the game makes you stop and think how to solve the challenge presented. On the down side, the music, while charming, can become distracting while you're thinking through a hard puzzle, and a couple of times puzzles will require you to react fast before an enemy messes everything up forcing you start that particular puzzle over. On the whole, the game is certainly worth the price and is a great game to play with a good friend.
Now, I'm sure you're tired of hearing me talk about the greatness of the game.  Of course it has its flaws.  Grammatical and spelling errors, no doubt caused by translation problems, are hilarious. ("So, let us here it", instead of "let us hear it")  There are also times when the wrong person is talking, or the wrong person is spoke of.  In the end, however, the problems aren't so bad as for you to not figure it out in the end.  They are also a bit on the rare side, and do not make the game seem too "error-filled" or childish.  Sometimes it can get a bit confusing on where you have to go and what you have to do... Sometimes things just seem to happen randomly, with no direct idea of what to do.  There are those traditional times when you just want to kick the character and scream "DUH!  YOU IDIOT!"  And of course finding all 108 Stars is a pain, but that's the challenge of the game.

This is definitely a game that immediately needs to be downloaded to your Nintendo 3DS/2DS.  :)
The Ultra Combo was a lengthy auto combo that you could execute after landing at least a three-hit combo. If you could pull this move off when your opponent's lifebar was nearly depleted, it would result in you totally owning your opponent in a torrential downpour of pain, landing brutal hit after brutal hit after brutal hit. In video games, there were few feelings as satisfying as pulling off this move and watching your opponent get thoroughly beaten. After that, the game voice would even scream "ULTRA!" just to cement the moment.

Well, if you're just reading this to advertise, or if you're reading this to buy, take my advice, this is a great find, totally worth it. Even if you don't want to get this for you, if you know someone who wants to find a great game like this, this is a game to get.
As the story goes, Dracula rises once every century to terrorize the the innocents of Transylvania.

The use of puzzles through the game is also well done and some are real brainteasers, they are also more inventive than in RE, such as finding the right combination of gases for a poisoned room to gain entry or searching corpses for fingerprints to make a keycard.

5522	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I remember my friend and I playing rampage on the n64 (he has it) but then we went to rent a game and we rented rampage 2. so we played it and noticed that there are different monsters now and you have to unlock the original 3. We couldn't save the game (my guess was he didn't have a memory card for his n64) and it was just like the first game but graphics were better and other stuff i don't remember (we played this like, 3 years ago) and i was the rat and he was the rhino. around level 20 we both got GAME OVER!? In the first rampage for the n64, there was no game over (unless you7 quit) but hey, atleast this had bonus levels too. later i got rampage world tour (the first one) and played it with my friends and i beat it like twice. get the first one instead....Then go for this one because the first will get boring over time.

I don't know if I can find this game, but boy if you can! Find three friends and Play it without mercy.
Anyway, the game is lush and filled with endless amounts of loot.  Any monster has a chance to drop rare goodies when slain (based on Alucard's Luck stat), fake walls crumble to reveal hidden platemail, accidentally-tripped switches open bookcases or trapdoors, and zillions of types of monsters appear from all over the place.  The music is great and quite haunting, and the game's RPG and money system are quite well developed.  Alucard has quick "combo" spells you can use while fighting, and many of the weapons, shields, and armors he finds have their own effects which have to be discovered in game play.  I've located weapons that let Alucard teleport, summon the undead to fight for him, call lightning, ice, or fire, or even waves of holy light down on his foes.  Everything from helms to circlets to rings to boots can be worn, and Alucard eventually even develops the ability to transform into traditional vampire modes.  Dissipate into a swirling cloud of mist and waft through a ceiling vent to escape your enemies, turn into a wolf and charge through crowds of zombies, or transform into a bat and fly around breathing fire on everyone.  Lastly Alucard collects various magical relics throughout the game, that do everything from let him breathe underwater to have permament familiars that float around with him on screen and help him out (the dancing runesword is not to be missed).  As an example of the thought put into this game, your familiars themselves even gain experience and go up levels, growing both stronger and smarter over time.  For example, the runesword familiar at first just kinda floats along behind you, lethargically swinging at things long after they took a bite out of you.  But after a while it turns into a gleaming heat seeking weapon of vengeance, mercilessly smiting anything the second it shows up on screen.  At one point I turned Alucard into mist and just drifted around while the sword familiar took out a boss for me.  This game also has more items and secrets in it than your average Final Fantasy, and is more addictive.  It is also one of the least frustrating games you can find; you can save as often as you want in save rooms you find on your map (in a coffin, natch), heal yourself easily, and as a vampire you're more than a match for the sluggish beasts you meet early on.  The challenge of the game comes from an easy balance of combat and puzzle solving, rather than a heavy reliance on one or the other.
I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.

Battle System (score 8/10): Battles are a basic turn-based system.  The usual attack, defend, magic, item commands.  As an interesting twist, you can move around the battle screen, thus making position a part of strategy.  The only complaint I have with battles is that there is an "A.I." command, whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you.  I didn't really like this because the option is listed first in the menu, which means you'll spend some time accidentally hitting it.  It would've been better if they'd put it at the bottom of the menu.  Well, this isn't really a big deal since the cursor in the game "remembers" where you last had it and always starts up there.  So, once you turn on the game and select "command", the next battle will have the cursor already on "command".  This was quite convenient.

Although it has it's short comings it's still the Doom we all know and love.
Graphics: The graphics in this game especially for its time, I thought to be simply unbelievable. The random battles are done in 3-D, a first that I know of, for an rpg to do that on a console system and definately set the bar for rpg's to follow. The cg clips were simply breathtaking at the time but after today's games its hard to believe I thought that when I first played the game. You can tell that they were definitely trying to move past the sprite based characters (which they did in battles) from the previous games but they just couldn't leap that hurdle until Final Fantasy VIII. The backgrounds were interactive instead of just being completely preset, but weren't fully 3-D, I guess you could call it 2-D interactive.
Update (10/19/12): Okay, I am almost through with this game and feel like throwing up. The end is VERY intense, with the Final Egg level almost being impossible due to collision issues and camera bugs, but I got through it. Chaos actually succeeds and completely destroys the city (which is only made worse by the Dreamcast / Gamecube's jaw-dropping graphics), and the song that plays (Open Your Heart) really makes me sick. Awesome.

 At times also the puzzles and gameplay were a  little simplistic--but the story always carried it on, in my opinion.  You  /wanted/ to know what would happen next, even if you had to do some silly  tasks to find out what.  As for content: a little violence (you're a cop,  after all), a little bit of scantily clad female CGI flesh, and a bit of  swearing--nothing over the top.  Play it even if you haven't seen the  movie--you'll probably want to after you finish the game, though.

The plot of the game is essentially no different from that of the other Mario games prior to this with the exception of Super Mario Bros. 2; Bowser has kidnapped Princess Toadstool (yes that was her name before she had a name change to Princess Peach) and it's up to Mario and Luigi to rescue her. Bowser has a lot of help this time from his Koopa family much like he did in Super Mario Bros. 3 and they're not going to give her up too easily this time around. Being Mario, he'll just hop his way around town to find her and that'll be the end of it right there.

A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.

9599	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Final Fantasy Tactics is an incredible accomplishment.  While bearing the Final Fantasy name, it is not part of the main numbered series.  Final Fantasy Tactics brings a new style of gameplay to the Final Fantasy series: strategy.  This is a strategy game.  The goal of Tactics is not so much to explore the world, but rather to strategically win battles to advance the story.  The only exploration comes in finding where the best place on the battlefield is to put your characters in order to attack the most effectively.  This is a difficult game to get into at first, but given the chance the game becomes very addictive and soon may be one of your favorite games.  It is that good.
It is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.
9585	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game's story is so epic, that at times, it seems that the story was wasted on a game designed with a focus on battles, although at other times, the format of the game seems to suit the story perfectly, as when the characters speak during mid-battle. The plot of this game has the theme of "exploring history in search of truth," and demonstrates, through allegory, the biases of the societal forces which allow for the recording of history, and the tendency of historians to attribute heroic characteristics to the victors of any scenario, regardless of their true alignment, or intentions. At many points in the plot, unexpected events occur, with the attentive player having received just enough information to speculate on the motivations of the characters involved, and playing through the game, there were many such moments at which I speculated improbably twisted scenarios, only to be shocked when future events actually confirmed my dark suspicions, or clarified the scenario to be even more depraved than I had imagined. This is not an incredibly violent game, nor is it atmospherically dark, in the film noir sense. But it is a deeply philisophical game, which doesn't under-represent the magnitude of human suffering, the tendency of humans to abuse power, or the unreliability one's personal allies in societies conducive to individual scheming. The character of Delita, who comes across as contradictorily skeptical and idealistic, is too much of a master-moralist, in the Nietzschean sense, to qualify as a hero, but is too difficult for a player, sensitive towards his motivations, to villainize. Even the abberant supernatural elements of this mostly human and political story work well from a literary standpoint, as the relationship between Ajora, the Lucavi, and those who seek the Zodiac stones is represented with style and subtlety, adding Faustian intrigue to the plot.
3897	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have always been into video games. I was looking forward to buying one of the new systems when one night my mom came home and on the table she put down two controllers,two games, and two memory cards. I asked her why she bought all that stuff and she told me that she got it for an amazingly low price. She thought that it would be a great gift for someone that had the console. Then she allowed me to take one controller out of the box and hold it. I was stunned by how comfortable it was. So then I looked at the box and it said "for use with the SEGA Dreamcast" on it. So then I started to wonder if the Dreamcast is good. after doing some research I decided that the Dreamcast was very cheap but well worth the money.

After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.

You can jack cars from anyone including the police. The main point of this game is that you have to work for 7 ruthless gangs without getting your hide thrown in jail. The jobs start off easily but then increase each time you work for a gang. The harder the job is the more money you get. But, in order to work for a gang you have to show some respect. There are seven different gangs in the city and each of them hate each other. When you work for one gang then another gang looses respect for you then you gotta kill gang members from the gang that likes you then the gang that hates you will respect you so you can get another job from the gang that likes you. Well, it's kinda tricky at first but once you get the hang of getting respect from another gang it's pretty fun. There are over 100's of jobs and over 100's of cars. You can choose from armored lemos to tanks or even ice cream trucks! Also, this game is free. You can do anything to achieve your goals. You can put a bomb in a car and drive it to a gang's safehouse and blow them sky high! Almost anything you can do. That's why I love this game! If you love being the bad guy sometimes and love a game where you can do anything from getting chased by cops to working for dangerous gangs then get this game!

If you have this game tucked away somewhere, you owe it to yourself, to dust off the Genesis and have another go.  I promise you, its just as much fun the second, third, and fourth time around.

It's a lot like Final Fight in third person, except that you can perform different combo's, gaining each one each level. Otherwise you can just tap on the attack buttons and use the basic moves. I loved using the combo's, and if you can button mash different combo's you'll discover them on your own and not need the game to give them to you every level. Each character has his and her own selection of cool martial art moves and it's awesome to see them go into effect. The enemies are hacked into various body parts like arms, legs and heads being amputated. Another great feature is the level design, they're so detailed and gloomed up with fog, rain and dirt that it makes it so much fun to simply run around and explore everything. It does look somewhat grainy and pixels to become apparent the closer you become to objects, but this gives the game an even darker look you can really appreciate. The levels are also very unique from one another giving the player some great variety.

The item roster is slightly different from Super Mario Kart, but it's fun to use them all.

Humor:Duke is one funny son-uva-gun. He says all these stupid yet funny things like I've got balls of steel! and Come get some! plus all these other outragouse and not-for-Amazon.com things(play the game to find out what).Also this game has strong sexual themes for those of you that are sensetive about that but you can turn the gore off if you want.
- Most of the games may be pretty familiar to even casual gamers of Nintendo family games, but they also don't feature motion controllers

The only reason I played games as a kid was to see what happened next. I only wanted a new weapon in Mega Man because it was cooler than the M-Buster. It was a fetish. Mastering a challenge to achieve fun was foreign to me.

  The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.

I found the initial learning curve to be pretty quick however more then a few of the objectives are fairly difficult so i wouldn't recommend the game for young children or the easily frusterated. (you're going to need to save often to be successful)
But I keep getting drawn back to the fantastic Alpha Centauri by Sid Meier and company.  Although sort of a sequel to Meier's highly popular Civilization II, it is just different enough to be easily the best civilization type computer game currently available.
The graphics are pretty good, but there is  something about the characters (human and non-human) that doesn't look  quite right.  The scenery is excellent though.

6776	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Sega Genesis "The Lion King" is one of the best 2D platforms available on the console.  Using the full capabilities of the system it features massive levels and intelligent AI.  This game is not as simple as one may think.  Some levels and I mean the first only you can run through.  After that the enemies and obstacles can be a great danger.  If you happen to run out of continues you must start from the beginning of the game.  Don't worry you have many chances in game to get more single lives and even whole continues that in easy mode = 8 lives.  If that isn't enough this game does support a cheat menu for invincibility and level select.  However the cheat menu is hidden and you have to enter a simple combo at the menu to unlock it.  This game is an amazing feat of the Genesis era supporting stereo audio and separate music for each level all packed into a small cartridge.  This is a great game.

7260	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the best games for the 64 and it sells for a fair price.  We all know Rare made some of the best games on the system and this was no exception.  To sum up the plot you are a driver is a set of various construction / destruction vehicles tasked with clearing the way for nuclear missiles.  If you don't clear the level the rockets go boom.
Now onto gameplay; the controls of Sonic the Hedgehog are absolutely amazing! The physics are entirely momentum-based--meaning that you have the ability to roll down a slope in order to pick up speed. To do this, all you have to do is walk up to a downward slope, press the down button, and watch your hedgehog go. While in this ball form, Sonic will kill almost any robot he touches.

If it wasn't for the permanent marker, I would give this a 5 star.
But on to the game itself.  As the subject title implies, (for me) it is and always will be, a timeless classic in the history of videogames, as it is almost the first real game I ever played and actually tried and succeeded in completing.  For the time, it's graphics were close to cutting edge, and the story is simple, yet actually completing everything 100%, is quite a difficult task depending on what part you're trying to do so on.  The gameplay mechanics are a little stiff, but no more than expected from a game released in 1998 on a system that has been rebooted 4 times since the one this game was developed for.  If you care at all about great games, or if you played this in your childhood, you're going to want this for your collection.

After all these years, Final Fantasy Tactics is still a game I enjoy returning to every once in a while. The engaging story and unique characters make it a truly enjoyable experience no matter how old you, or the game, get. And because of the class system, it can be played differently every time. Ever done a solo calculator run?

Best game ever (so far).
I can honestly say that I probably won't use this product in the future. I wouldn't even recommend this as a back up because of it's poor quality and especially not as your main TV hookup. I have another 3 in 1 but it's an AC adapter and it's the same thing. These unlicensed after market remakes never seem work the way they should.



Suikoden 1 and it feel extremely alike, you can still love the characters, and the relationship between Joey and Hero is tremendously powerful.

`Donkey Kong Country' was also the largest ever cartridge at the time carrying a massive (at the time) 32mb, and `til this very day the game remains a classic. If you still have a Snes or your a retro gaming fan like myself you should pick this up as soon as possible.

Chemical plant- 10/10: Sonic had a ton of speed in Chemical Plant. If this were a Mario level you would never complete it in time. The level is so massive, but Sonic made it look like a trip to the local market. The theme is one of the most catchy things ever produced as well, but the boss was a another LOL moment. Eggman spends half an hour filling up a tiny bucket with chemicals, and then tries to dump it on Sonic. Poor Eggman's Eggpod exploded before he could even finish filling up the bucket.
Overall rating 10!!!!!!
Seriously though, if you do not have this game you are missing out on the greatest video game ever created, and it isn't just for kids either, I'm 18 and i still love this game after 10 years. I would also recommend getting Prime, and the first Metroid. Zero Mission is also pretty good, but be aware it is extremely short, but still MUCH better than Fusion, which was a total let-down.

The graphics are definitely impressive. The control scheme works perfectly. I also found the story to be fairly impressive. Tremendous improvements over Goldeneye in Perfect Dark are obvious.

  The game has admirable voice acting to make the gaming experience feel better. It's voice acting is usually done correctly being very precise and on time so don't expect voice acting timing like in Silent Hill. You'll experience some great sounding explosions, and the gun shots sound unbelievably real. If you turn up the volume and play with the volume set on very high, when a zombie pops out you will probably need a diaper change, but you will get retribution by blasting his head of and hearing the clarity of sound effects.

Yoshi's Island has a unique array of boss characters.  They each have different strengths and weaknesses, and there are two per world, which should make for an interesting challenge.  Although, in my opinion, they are quite easy.  Something else I like about Yoshi's Island are all the different enemies; there are dozens!  Each one is unique as well, and adds a lot of diversity to the game.

6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!)
Pro's: Nice graphics,  nice control (with a Gravis X-terminator), Nice sound, nice puzzles, and  good storyline.  Many people have complained about how the controls suck.  If you have a Gravis X-terminator, you will have no problems.  The default  buttons are setup up perfectly and you'll never have to touch the keyboard  unless you are moving your mouse to save.  Also someone said that Indy  moves too slow - I have not thought that at all.  He runs and jumps with  good speed.  I'm running on a 450 Mhz Celeron with a VooDoo5500 AGP  with  128 MB of RAM on 1024x768 on 32 bit mode and I see no slow downs.  I think  these people are playing on a keyboard or some lower end gamepad and  machine.  The puzzles are pretty simple, but not too easy.  Most of them  are logical, but some I have had to go on the internet and look for  walkthrough's for this game.  The first time I got this game, it kept me  playing for 2 hours.

2849	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I thought Spyro The Dragon was great,but when I was done,I was looking for some other great action/adventure games. Ape Escape took the place of excitment,and it didn't fail. You'll love this game!
The puzzles are a pretty good variety:  some inventory, some conversation, some mechanical.  Most are pretty easy once you find what you're looking for, but there are a couple of frustrating pixel hunts where it's possible to miss the one thing you need to move on.  Also, sometimes the inventory, which flashes when it can be used, has to be positioned in exactly the right place.  There are also a few action sequences and you can die.  Usually I really object to this in adventure games, but _Sanitarium_ handles the action the way it should be handled:  the sequences are pretty straightforward, if you die you get to start again at the beginning of the sequence without going through a tedious "You failed" ending sequence or reloading from page one, you have infinite lives, and the pieces of the puzzle you have managed to solve STAY solved, so you don't have to repeat what you've already done over and over.  Take a tip from this, game designers!
The only downsides to this game are Mario's horribly annoying voice, an occasionally fussy camera, and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser. These minor neusances are mild though and they don't really hinder the gameplay. All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves: Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series. I also don't like the changes made to Princess Toadstool. Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series, she seems more like a "dumb blonde" with a weird voice.
the blood looks like crushed cranberry sauce.
And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it.

Graphics aren't great, but that's not what makes this game a winner. The gameplay is constant. It is frantic at times. Should you send Han on that sabotage mission or leave him to help lead troops into battle against an Imperial system? And some characters are Force-sensitive, allowing them to be trained by Luke (or Vader or the Emperor) once they reach a certain rank.

With a revolutionary graphics engine and fantastic gameplay to boot, `Dkc' took the gaming world by storm and indeed acted as the final nail in the Megadrives coffin. Also notable is that this was the first `Big hit' from gaming giants Rare who would follow with the classics `Goldeneye' and `Perfect Dark'.
In conclusion I will say this. This would be a great game if it were merely civilization in space. But what makes it the best of all time for me is the story. There is a sci-fi storyline to this game, and when interacting with other faction leaders you almost feel like you're watching a historical epic with you as one of the main characters (at least that's how I felt the first time I played). I once even found myself daydreaming about conversations I was having with different faction leaders. Maybe I had just gone a little too long without sleep, maybe I was just playing a little too much, or maybe...this is the greatest strategy game ever made. Now to get back to reading the prologue I downloaded off of the offical website and download some wallpaper...
All in all, this is definitely worth buying, especially if you like a good love story.
The story of The Last Revelation is very intricate - gripping, without being too unbelievable. While exploring Egypt, Lara discovers the lost tomb of the Ancient Egyptian God, Set. He was outwitted and imprisoned in a secret tomb, and warns that he will one day return to seek vengance. Lara unwittingly unleashes its ancient evil, fulfilling the prophecy that threatens to plunge mankind into eternal darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all her wit and skill to re-imprison Set to save the world from unspeakable evil and Armageddon! The Last Revelation begins with a flashback level from the 1980's when Lara was 16 on her first exploration in Angkor Wat, Cambodia. She is led around by her mentor, Werner Von Croy. This is really just a training level that teaches new Tomb Raider players the ropes on how to control Lara. After this, the game really begins - in the present day. We learn that on their escape from the tomb in Cambodia, Lara left Von Croy to die after the tomb began to collapse around her. It's not long, however, until we find out that Mr Von Croy is indeed alive and well, and on the look out for Lara to get revenge! The game is split into six different sections; Training Levels, Recovering the Amulet of Horus, Discovering the Truth, The Search for the Armor, The Search for Jean-Pierre and The Final Conflict. This game has been giving a rating of 11+, but I think it should be at least a 15+ because the graphics are much better than the first two games, making everything look more life like. I admit that some of the levels on this game, especially towards the end scared me to death! I used to sit there with both eyes squinted, scrwaming my head off as the sweat used to pour from my hands...pretty sad when you think about it now! Despite this, the levels are amazingly intricate and full of life and colour - much more detailed than any of the games in the series. Since the game is set entirely in Egypt, you get a real feel to what life is like over there and almost become part of the game. This game took me nine months to complete (December 1999-September 2000) and I have to say that I enjoyed every second of it! Lara has a variety of new features and you also have to go back and forth between levels to find a particular object that will open the door to the finale. The cut-scenes that run through the entire game to tell the story are absolutely mind-blowing. The graphics are brilliant - it's just like watching a film...and Lara's boobs seem to get bigger as the series goes along! The last level truly is one of the greatest, most spectacular levels in video gaming history which involves a confrontation with the God Set! In the final cut-scene of the game, Lara is seen exiting the crumbling tomb to find Von Croy at the entrance. Emotion takes over and he puts out his hand, but it's too late. The tomb collapses with Lara still inside. This really was a tense moment for Tomb Raider fanatics as they were left wondering if this was it for Lara, if there favourite compuiter game series was over for good. They need not have worried as Tomb Raider: Chronicles and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel Of Darkness followed!

7977	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This a great game for you, who likes to solve medium problems, loves to talk with interesting creatures and beat evil lurks! This Zelda was one of the first adventure/role games I played trough. It lasted a long time until I finally met Ganon himself and I got the Trio force back. I have many reasons to recommand this fantastic game. 1. Imagine yourself sleeping in your own house in rainy night... Suddenly, you hear your uncle's voice that wants you to come King's castle because some evil enemies are there. You wake up and dress your clothes. It's time to find out what is going on. Later, you find your uncle who is just dying because a bad Afgahnim strikes him deadly. He gives you his sword and hopes that you can beat the evil Afgahnim. And this little story was only beginning. I think that Zelda's storywriters have an unbelievable imagination! 2. Music makes this game enjoyable and comfortable to play because it sounds so good. Especially, the melody of the castle boss has written so exciting that you really make fighting a fine situation. 3. Game characters and creatures are made with good taste and personal way. You can meet Zora's water human, centauries, pig soldiers, witches, crystal maidens, talking woods and so on 4. Problem solving is a major challenge. This is not game that last only few hours because there so many difficult problems to solve. Use you brain and try to find answers without guidelines. Don't get angry if you don't find to answer immediately. Ask your role-play friends to help because they will advice you. 5. Items you collect are variable. Bow, hook shoot, shovel, bombs Are very valuable to you if you want to survive all enemies, castles and challenges. If you play this classic game, you'll know, why this one of the best games in the world Entertainment is guaranteed
Even the characters are lame. I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb, but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones. Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie, and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is, well the chunky side.
Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.
Im a girl and I think its still cool even if im not a guy. This is NOT waste of your money.
The gameplay and controls in the game, while doing nothing really new for the genre, are loose and easy. This is a system that will never be perfect, lacking the fluidity of the Tomb Raider games and the precision of point-and-click adventures, but does the job nicely. The auto-aim of games like Residnet Evil isn't present, so shooting can become a tense and exciting exercise - but you'll more often than not end up running scared from whatever it is you can't see.
This is the game that made video games become really popular. If you stop by Funcoland or any store with SNES games pick up this game today along with Super Mario All-Stars, another great SNES game with 4 Mario games on it.

Unfortunately, first-person combats are not as fun as they could  be.  Monsters respawn (shudder!).  And, depending on the skills you  acquired at the start of the game, you may not be skillful enough to combat  efficiently at the beginning, and will be prone to dying over and over  again and having to keep restoring your save games (which, on my Pentium II  400 with 96MB, takes over 1 minute per restore).

Over the years, I've played every Mario game in the main series either at or near launch, from the 1985 "Super Mario Bros." to the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. 2" and all the games in between, missing only two: the 1989 "Super Mario Land", the most insubstantial Mario game in existence, and the 2002 "Super Mario Sunshine" [from 2002] for the Gamecube.

Mystic Cave- 7/10: This level focused more on puzzle then speed. Unlocking rock doors got really frustrating. I've seen Sega have better ideas then a cave, but it was not that bad.

So, Final Fantasy VII gets a perfect score. For all its imperfections and hype, it offers too memorable and inimitable a trip to deserve anything less.

That is all I can tell you without ruining anything. Just try the game and you'll be sure to love it.

8428	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	It's a lot like an early final fantasy game remixed to have a Mario Bros. theme (sans Luigi) Being an RPG it offered much more insight into the Mushroom kingdom world. Also the game made great use of a 3-D style playing field in a time when games were still mostly flat. Tip: This product will outlast a wii download version.
7973	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Zelda LTP is one of the best games ever made.  The plot is superb in every way.  The level desighn is off the chart.  This game truly deserves some credit.  I was so addictive to this game when I first got it which was round 1996.  The Game was simply a masterpiece.  The controls for the snes was good I really had fun with it acctually.
The Ocarina of time is one of few artistic highlights I encountered in my life...it's almost ridiculous when I think about what I've just wrote, what about literature, art and cinema?
You got a Dreamcast?...GET THIS!  It will "obvioulsy" save some of the biggest and baddest DC games around.  Too far In Soul Calibur?  Had enough skatin' and doin' some nice Graffiti in Jet Grind Radio?

Even though, there's not really ALL that much to do in these cities, you probably won't notice it too much. All the stuff is pretty fun. You get to put out fires, rescue people, chase down speeders, etc. A fun little thing is that when you transport people, if you start to descend as fast as you can, the little displays of them in your chopper show them getting all flustered and scared. Classic.
-THE MUSIC SOUNDTRACK HERE IS SOME OF THE BEST IN VIDEOGAME MUSIC. Seriously. This ranks up there with Mega Man 2, Gradius 2 & 3, Castlevania 4 & SotN, and Turrican as far as jaw-dropping video game music goes. Not a single one of these tunes is bad, and all are very catchy, probably some of the best that you'll find on the Genesis. My favorites have to be the Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, (2-player) Mystic Cave, and Metropolis tunes.

3) There are a few super moves that are not in MvC part 2. Like Chun Li's has four supers in this game, while she has only three in part 2.
This game is packed with options, including the requisite multiplayer feature (itself loaded with options) several one-player historical campaigns and a special campaign specifically made to teach you the game. My favourite part is the campaign/scenario editor, where you can build your own battle from scratch.
The graphics are some of the best I've seen for the SNES.  While they do look a little cartoony, they look like wonderfully hand-drawn canvas pictures.  The paralax scrolling is nice as well.  The music for each level is extremely catchy, like the jungle theme.

Although the game is not without its problems that are irritatingly noticble now (a horrible translation, bad grammer, etc) for its time this game was revolutionary. Square made great use of FMV technology to progress this very anime like story line. FF VII is one of three titles argued to be the best of them (VI, VII and VIII), and is the game that started the RPG revolution that made Playstation what it is today.

Imagine Mario against Link?IS that possible?Here it is, you can even throw in a Pikachu!.The combat system is easy enough and each character has a blend of moves and taunts. Some characters are good for close rang while others are good at middle ground. The levels branch off from the characters own worlds. Like Link would have a castle roof top to fight on. Yoshi would have a little story book zone and so on. Colors can be changed for the outfits so you can tell who's who if you play as the same character as oneanother. The weapons span out from each of the characters franchises with a Mario fire flower and so on. I can't believe how exspensive this is this is truly a must have.

There is 2 reasons that I think you should buy this over  StarCraft... One is that it has two GREAT previews of the upcoming game  WarCraft 3 and the game Diablo 2.  The other reason is that not everyone  can afford computers that are incredibly fast.  So if you can not play  StarCraft very quickly and it goes slow on b.net for you, then WarCraft2 is  something you must buy because it will work much more effectively.
2056	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I've had this game basically since it launched in 2000. I must say, the graphics are rather impressive for an N64 game, and the gameplay is great. The minigames are fun, especially when playing with other people. The only real problem I had with this game is how it didn't last long at all. It has about 100-150 mini games, but you can easily beat the game and unlock them all within about a week of good playing time.

People often refer to this as an action RPG. I guess that makes sense. You do level up, sort of, as you play. And you do collect weapons, magic, and gadgets, which you also power up. But it really feels like an action game.

And so the DKC trilogy ended with this underrated gem as it was the least liked of the three. Rare would go on to make bigger and better games on the Nintendo 64 and they will always be remembered for the contributions they made during the SNES era. If you've played through Donkey Kong Country 1 and 2, then you already played this game. If you haven't done so, track down a used copy or get yourself a Wii and download it from the Virtual Console service for 800 points ($8.00.) Long live, DKC trilogy!!!
134	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	While the product is what it is described as, it unfortunately will give me no signal whatsoever. I believe it is a fault of the a/v cable side, as plugging that in, unplugging it, blowing on it, hissing at it, calling it names, then plugging it back in seems to make it work again. I did check and have the problem across more than one tv, so it's not the tv's fault. I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii, but I doubt so, as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with (why, Wii, did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default? HD isn't that rare). Ah, but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable I could find, and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cabling.

The only quarrel I have with the N64 is Nintendo coming to the conclusion that it should go cart based instead of disc. Carts couldn't hold as much information as the disc based PS1, so often cut-scenes or intro videos were cut out to save room. Not a complete deal breaker but not the smartest move. This also equaled games being highly compressed and looking blurry or washed out. Nintendo has always been a step behind the pack, but I believe had they chosen to go the disc route they may have won that gens console war.



Unfortunately, there are some subtle  problems with this game that make it vastly inferior to the previously  mentioned titles, and cause the game play to be rather slow and  frustrating.

3831	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Alright, ill start off with the bad,then the good. The first bad part of the game that plagues every sport game, it takes to much blankin memory. Good lord, the back says it takes 184.hey, they {were incorrect], 189.sounds like it doesnt make a difference, well it does.if it took as much as they say it did,i wouldnt have had to delete game files to play it.....another thing, although the games sound is excellent, the voive over becomes repetetive after some amount of hours in gameplay. Now to the good. The gameplay is great,decently fast, with varied difficulty levels. However, if you're playing rookie, then you move up to pro.its almost impossible, the learning curve is high. But the graphics look really great.im not comparing this game to its more famous counterpart nfl2k1. Im saying the graphics are great, sound is just as great,and gameplay is excellent. You can create your own player(it has a good create a player mode)or even a team!!however, what really stinks is you cant play with a created team in a season,thats stupid.

But I wasn't having fun.  I realized that the game was  pretty deep, and dwelling deeper into the game's cool storyline would  require more of the bad AI, terrible - I mean HORRIBLE combat system, and  scrappy mouse driven interface.

6647	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Morpheus offers a haunting and intricate story, elaborate settings, and a significant amount of game play.  The dialogue is well-written and I found myself drawn into the characters and story and not wanting the game to end.  Puzzles range in difficulty from easy to fairly difficult, but all were  fun to solve.
The gameplay is almost the same...you'll find yourself rolling the first 4-5 weeks, notice the difficulty start increasing, and by Week 12 or 13 you'll have a heck of a time running OR passing.  Fortunately, so long as you have a good defense, it's really easy to stop the computer.  I think the most they've scored on me using the Steelers (and I mean, the Steelers are useless on offense in this game) is 14 points.  The real joy of this game has always been playing head to head with another player.

Going back now, yes, even though back then I didn't think it was possible back in 1996 when I first played this, we moved far beyond this game graphically.  The polygons look dated, and the camera has gotten a notorious repution, with IGN even calling the camera system "broken" by today's standards.  And yes, subsequent titles may have perfected the 3D gameplay, but really, it was Mario that led the charge, and even today the game holds up well.  Now I play "Super Mario 64" with my own kids who love it too.

But all in all, if you're at all a fan of Resident Evil style games, this one's for you. A warning that the game was given a Mature rating by the ESRB, and it is deserved. While the game has no swearing (that I can remember), or nudity, the mood is very, very dark and intense.

5975	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	It IS point and click!  Yeah, the greatest RPG of all time!  It certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other RPG.  All my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing.  They are all now one with the chair that they sit in.  Greatest RPG?  Not even close.  Those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now.  I observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths.  The only thing that moves is the hand, making quick, convulsive movements.  I say that even if it does expand your brain (Ha, ha), the other negative effects far outweigh the good.

Man, did this bring back old memories. Doom 64 is a then updated version of the classic series. The demons looked better and still had the eeriness the series has always had.

Once they had me hooked into the concept of mindless repetitive character rolling to find the one with the perfect strength characteristics I was looking for (I was much more picky when I was younger than I am now), it was the beginning of the end, at least for me.

Even though I knew it came with no controllers, I still was a little disappointed, but hey, I got one arriving in a few days anyway, so no problem.

As the mayor, you must face issues like riots, traffic, polution, crime, and natural disasters like tornados, fires, floods and even Bowser coming to destroy your city!!!

Everything about this game is outstanding. Beautiful, even. From the development of each character to the unique and exciting areas you will travel to, this game will have you loving every single second of every minute you spend playing it. You'll travel the world, going to real-life locations like the Great Wall of China, the Ankor Wat, and even the Great Pyramids, in search of the Mystic Statues and any trace of your father. It's as if every single pixel used for the graphics of this game were given an untold amount of detail, and it shows tremendously well. The game isn't ridiculously difficult in any way, but it gradually gets more difficult as you get closer towards the end, just like any good game should do. It also retains the world map system that Soul Blazer did, being that all destinations can be selected by simply choosing them on the world map itself. Everywhere you go, there's always something new to discover or something left to do, even if it feels like nothing at all. The adventure itself just seems endless, in every kind of good way imaginable.

The story was great, and the graphics are by far the best on PlayStation. The music was amazing too, and rivals many professional bands. Zell was by far my favorite character, he was so cool. The CG animations were the best part of the game, though, which had great pieces of the love story thrown in there. It's amazing that a game could be so great. It was like watching a movie that I desperately wanted to finish. The GFs were the best from any Final Fantasy, and have been brought into FF9 and FFX. The only bad part was how easy the bosses in the final tower were. I had cactuar, and equipped Zell with Kamikaze, and I just used that on every boss. I killed everyone but the final boss with it one hit. The hardest monsters were in the forest where you get Ifrit, and these were the Tyrannosaurus Rex type things. A great game with many different plotlines, and an overall great game.
Planescape: Torment represents a fantastic creative achievement, with a strange and twisted land that has been painstakingly fleshed-out for gamers to explore. The game world features an astonishing number of areas to explore. It is also very flexible -- there are many ways to accomplish tasks, from using force to smooth talking to magic means. You can choose to be evil, cruel, or callous. Perhaps you'd rather be benevolent, helpful, even generous. Unlike most role-playing games, you don't have a fixed class and you do not choose your own alignment. Your actions determine your alignment over time, and you can change your class at will. The result is a very rare game that gives gamers a real opportunity to role play, one where characters react to you based on what you've done in the past. And the story itself is absolutely compelling and fascinating, a story so complicated that one playing will not be enough to reveal all its subtleties.

This game is very easy to pick up and play and very enjoyable to say the least. I have beat the game several times and its still a fun game to play. A classic game that combines graphics(especially for its time)and stellar gameplay and fun. If you haven't played this game your missing out on a classic and also check out Sonic CD for Sega CD only and the sequel Sonic The Hedgehog 2 for Sega Genesis.
The best part of Shadowrun is the ambience. Some equipment is illegal and you can get into a run-in with the law. Most characters are complete with portraits. The game keeps tabs on you: shoot a passer-by and you have a higher chance of being questioned by the police (although you can delete your police record- not for free, of course!). You may gain certain useful contacts over the course of your investigation. The music fits exceptionally well. The menus glow green, like low-quality computer screens. The denizens even have a jargon of their own.
2)The games and the graphics for them pretty much hold there own against the PS2. Awesome sports lineup and online play! Being realistic of course, eventually the PS2 may surpass the DC due to the advanced harware on the PS2, its now up to the game makers to utilize the full potential of the PS2, which is probably around a  year away. The PS2 still needs to mature before you see its true power.
Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango.
The game may be short, as it has 5 stages (And for some reason, it has a stage select, meaning you can just go to Stage 5 to beat the game), and it may have the Turtles put on an awkward smile throughout the game, but all in all, Fall of the Foot Clan is an epic classic!

Throughout the game, you race through 2D levels with plenty of platforms you jump on and pits and other obstacles you have to avoid by usually jumping over.  You also have malicious robots known as "Badniks" throughout the levels where you can either avoid them or you can attack them by jumping on them to set the animals inside the machines free.  Some of the most annoying Badniks in the game are Catterkiller in the Marble and Scrap Brain Zones, Roller in the Spring Yard Zone, Orbinaut in the Labyrinth and Starlight Zones, and Ball Hog in the Scrap Brain Zone.

The music is VERY good. I can't ever seem to forget the theme song from the amusement park! Graphics are way improved, plus you get to see how much "life" your enemies have left (in other words they have their own energy meters.)

The basis of the game is that you play as a character class; Wizard, Archer, Warrior, or (The guy with the axe) I forgot the class name sorry.

Cons:
  Graphics - Top notch, and as good as FF IX.  Many have re-watchability.
7276	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is what I love about racing games. This right here. Classic, hardcore, fast-paced action. No item throwing, no parachutes, no BS. Just awesome, old fashioned racing. AND IT'S HARD. The CPU are tough to beat. This will stand the test of time I assure you.
Finally Fantasy VIII is a story within a story. At the same time Squall is going on this journey of self discovery, he and his army is at war with a Sorceress that plans to wipe out the human race. Simple right? Wrong. There are so many insane twists in this game it's bound to drive you nuts. Just when you think you got it, you realize you don't. But one thing for sure is that IT IS a good vs. evil EPIC and you will love the many places you visit and the people you meet on your journeys across land, space and time.

But, I do own this and chaotic DM with 2 freinds and a bot couldn't get better. Quake 64 and Doom 64 can't offer this much fun. THis is essentially a port of the pc game, but with new levels and add-ons to existing levels. I recomend this game.
While soul caibur has tons of depth, it would have not have reached a perfect score had it not taken it to the next level, and by that I mean modes. That is the mistake that Virtua Fighter 3tb made. Namco saw fit to make Soul Calibur on the dreamcast the most ambitious 3D fighter to date, and they succeeded. They did a wonderful job of adding a fully featured versus mode, team battle, survival, and extra survival (one hit kill), modes, but they all pale in comparison to mission mode.

I have never came across a game that was this outstanding difficult in the 13 years I played various N64 games.
Anyone who says this game has no depth simply doesn't have a clue about its system.  Each character has three different fighting styles, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.  Some moves and super moves are only available in certain fighting styles.  Some fighting styles are better for attacking, and others are better defense, counters, and reversals.
This game was the reason why I play video games because I trying to find gems out there like this one, but it's hard to find a diamond among coal sometimes I guess.

I also like this version of Delta Force because bullets from your machine gun are capable of destroying vehicles and helicopters. In subsequent versions of the game, you would be required to use a rocket or other explosive, when in real life, a fusillade of rounds can bring down a chopper just as surely as an anti-aircraft missle.

Games legit, go buy it.


-I thought leveling up did get pretty annoying and boring at parts(I was worried that I had to be in a certain level so I can be strong enough for a boss so I'd spend like 50% of the game leveling up)
489	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure, thriller, problem solving, and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours, but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game.

Mario's was just an arcade game.  It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss.  Sonic's debut was better then Mario's.  A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary.  But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had.  Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in.
The most memorable stage is, if memory serves, the end of stage 3 where first you have to climb a blue building that uniquely shakes back and forth avoiding medusa heads, and a couple screens after this the atmosphere kicks in even stronger where you have to travel up a really big staircase outside avoiding demon bird creatures.  This is the best moment in the history of Castlevania!  I felt scared to continue forward!  Even the music kept me excited here.  Did I forget to mention how detailed and animated the bosses are?  They're also HUGE!  How could I forget!  Lots of variety, and guess what?  This game seems to specialize in boss fights above everything else not just in fantastic detail but the amount of them you'll face throughout the game.  The levels themselves are almost an afterthought in comparison.  Besides Dracula, Death and the really tall Frankenstein, there's also several other cool looking bosses.  The one made of gears is the most creative.  Expect several boss fights along the way.

Anyway, Suikoden is a fun and enjoyable RPG that can be bought for a very [good] price. It should take you at least a few months to find all the 108 characters without using a walkthrough. Pick it up and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.

And the Ugly:

Overall, some very nice tunes scattered through out the game. It's not mind blowing like some of the Square soundtracks, but it's a good one. You will enjoy it for the most part, I know I did.
(I have not played FFVI enough to make a judgement on it.)
overall, its an ok title, but to me its just more annoying than fun, i'm already level 21 and majority of the boss fights are becoming easy, but i'm nearly done with the game, so i have to beat it now. its a game that just wastes you time, all games are, but this one and simon's quest just literally wastes your time like no other. the portable games of Castlevania follow this formula now, which is disappointing. just try this game out for 5 minutes then you'll see what i'm taking about. its also an XBLA title so you can find it pretty easy or pay for a PS1 title.
This game reeks with coolness. But me and most other gamers/people want to know how this game managed to get a "Teen" rating. It is just as gory and profained as GTA

The directional references are easy to follow, but not red light obvious.  I liked the battles, nicely patterned but not boring.  The story line is just lie every other story line, group develops, each has issues to overcome so they can save the world from what man has done to it.  They face a monster/alien enemy.  There are plenty of dimensional shifts, and an android thrown in for fun.  Overall, this isn't the worlds hardest RPG, but it's fun, and that's what gaming's all about.

The graphics are great, the characters are well developed, and most importantly, the story is great. Basically, you are a student of magic and must become the leader you never wanted to be. Along the way, you'll meet a former teacher of magic, an overconfident jerk, along with his "posse", a comic bookish hot- headed hero, a rowdy, energetic girl, a responsible school headmaster, a girl- crazy sharpshooter, a friendly former soldier, a big, quiet caring man, and a clumsy future world leader. You start out being a cold, mean, anti- social person, but eventually become a caring, romantic, truthful guy, with the help of your girlfriend.

The graphics are considerably better in this latest installment of the series, and there are plently of new monsters to exterminate. As for the weapons, there isn't much new here...but at least it's kept relatively realistic with shotguns, pistols, and sub-machine guns, ect. The story is involved and although at some points predictable, it's executed well from start to finish.  Unfortunately, as in the other Resident Evil games, there is a lot of back tracking that must be done to complete the game...and having limited item space makes it all the more time consuming.  If you've played the previous Resident Evil games, you know what to expect.  There's also plently of fun secrets to unlock (like Battle Mode), and they add a considerable amount of replay value.  Resident Evil: Code Veronica is yet another great reason to own a Dreamcast.

I have beat the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and am on my second "pass" through the series. I will then give the "Omega Strain" a go on my PS2 once I am finished with SF3.

8482	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Though not one of the longer strategy -RPG's out there (that honor would have to go to Disgaea, or the epitome of all strategy RPG's Final Fantasy Tactics), Vandal Hearts is one of the most overlooked games on the Sony Playstation. Starting out the game you are put in the role of Ash who along with his friends Diego and Clint fight off a group of bandits who are attacking them. This sets the games gameplay in place, with blood flying and a soundtrack that only the fine folks at konami could produce, one that still echoes in my head to this day. Although the graphics are quite dated by todays standards the gameplay elements of this game are where it truly shines. After leveling up at level 10 or level 20 you are given the option to upgrade your character, thus allowing you access to new moves and enhanced abilities. For example archers can continue along the bowman path, or can get rid of their bows in exchange for the ability to fly which becomes irreplaceable later on in the game. Someone elses review said that this game had little replay value, but I would have to disagree, having beaten this game on at least 4 different occasions. Clocking in at somewhere around 16-22 hours it is not a long game, but there are somewhere around 6 or 7 seven secret levels, which are really tough and require precise skills, but if accomplished correctly open up not only a slightly secret ending, but also the class of Vandalier for Ash, opening up every skill in the game for the main character, and making him basically a God among the other soldiers. The realtionship between Ash and Elena develops throughout the game very well and the ties of friendship are established between other members of your party, just like any great RPG. Konami was on one hell of a roll back in the day, releasing this game, Suikoden, Metal Gear Solid, and Castlevania: SOTN within a year or two of each other, signifying them as one of the premiere publishers during the original Playstations golden Age, and producing all of these A class titles. Definitely do not miss out on the chance to own this game, especially if you grew up with games like Shining Force. Not to be passed up.

 Pros- great plot, 3 different endings (depending on the character's humanity level),beautiful music and voiceover with different accents.
You take control of Jean-Luc, a member of a SWAT-like military group out to stop a terrorist organization from using a powerful satellite to destroy the world. From there the story plays out similar to that of Metal Gear Solid except it's not as complicated (complete with a twist at the end.) You have access to a limited group of weapons that includes a pistol, shotgun and assault rifle. Later on, you'll be able to pick up a silencer, rocket launcher and ammunition packs to increase the ammo you can carry. You go from point A to point B in every stage  shooting soldiers, hitting switches, destroying laser beam sensors and acquiring keys for unlocking doors. Every so often, you'll face off against bosses which requires you to figure out the best way to beat them. To save your progress, you'll need to use a memory pack as this is a pretty long game. Beat the game on all difficulty levels and you unlock extra modes, characters for the multi-player section and game modifiers. If you have some friends, you can try out the multi-player mode with them for up to 4 players.

The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune.

The balance of the various kingdoms is far better than in the original, with all empires having serious strengths and equally devastating weaknesses.

The serious  player will probably take something on the order of a year to master the  game, because the complexity level is so high.

Not only is character generation open ended, but the game world is as well. You can travel all over Seattle and the outskirts without being stuck in some linear path. It's funny how people go nuts about Grand Theft Auto and how you can go anywhere and do anything. Well this was doing that long before. As you explore the world around you meet various different characters. Some will just talk to you or sell you stuff. Others will hire you for shadowruns. There are also other shadowrunners out there for you to meet and even hire to help you with your missions.
The camera has a tendency to swirl around when you need it to stay still, and to sit still when you need it to move.  The grainy, pixelated graphics and complete lack of distinguishing features in the levels make it not only very easy to get lost, but also very hard on the eyes.  When you need to jump across platforms or walk AROUND something, that's when things really get bad.  Flik leaves almost no shadow on the ground when he jumps, so your jumps will usually be blind leaps of faith.  The other problem is his feet.  He dangles his feet so low when he jumps, that 9 times out of 10 you will miss a platform because his feet won't plant on it.  And, when he does land, he won't stop running, which will send him promptly stepping right off the other end of the thing and forcing you to do the jump all over again.

8983	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	A couple of years ago I picked up a copy of Wild Arms 2 and I really enjoyed the game (despite hearing that it is the black sheep of the 3 Wild Arms games).  I enjoyed the game so much that I was willing to track down a copy of the first Wild Arms game and give this one a shot, too.  Once again, I wasn't disappointed.  This was one of the first RPGs on the Playstation (one) and predates Final Fantasy VII.  Right then, you should understand that the quality of graphics is naturally going to be much weaker, but this is an RPG and graphics really should not matter.  What matters is that the game is fun to play, even years later.  In many ways, this game is more similar to the SNES RPGs that preceeded the Playstation rather than the games that followed, but once again, this game was a lot of fun to play.

So many people were grabbing Nintendo 64's and this amazing game was completely overlooked. However it still sold about a million copies and will go down in history as one of the greatest Mario titles ever. I'm sure you noticed I said "Squaresoft" in my title, thats because back in 1996 "Square-Enix" was formally known as "Squaresoft". I consider this one of their best games ever created.
Final Fantasy VIII also utilizes the ATB battle system which has been in place since Final Fantasy IV.  The eighth installment in particular tries to differentiate itself from the rest of the series and succeeds.  Very well.  First there's Final Fantasy VIII's junction system.  Rather than having the convential level up system, this game opts instead to have the enemies raise levels with you.  It seems like this will make the game harder, but the junction system serves as a balance.  First, there's drawing spells.  In battle, characters can draw spells from the enemy.  It's a tedious task and often gets boring, but you can use any spell you have to increase your statistics.  But there's more than that.  You can't junction spells to your stats unless you junction Guardian Forces (Final Fantasy VIII's summons) to a character.
Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.

Played this on christmas with the relatives an they were having a blast. Didn't think they would considering it's N64 an not Xbox ONE.
There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.
4064	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have never played such an addicting game! The scenarios are different and fun, but the variety lacks. You get the same rides to choose from over and over again, and when you create your own roller coaster, your park guests become wimps and ignore it. The handymen are a pain to control since they never do their job and if you tell them to mow grass, it's all they do. Excellent for a game that came out before the year 2000.
This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat. Thanks
Story (10/10): Wow.  That's all I can say.  FF7 has an amazing intricate network of subplots and character histories on top of the main story.  I love the complexity of it.  However, the one drawback to this complex story is that it requires multiple playthroughs and some thought before you catch everything.  To me though, this makes the game better, not worse.  Also, the pacing of the story is excellent.  I never felt bored or compelled to continue "just to reach the end".

NOW! The reason that this game suck's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic, the special effects are NOT shocking at all, you can't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction, many characters look lame, if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up, and many stages are VERY small.

At any rate, despite what you read or hear about the game, it's the best Doom game out of them all, in my opinion. Even more so than the original itself. True, it's your standard Doom experience. But, once you play it, you'll see why I consider it the best game out of them. The production values were high on this one.
Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral.
Speedy platforming makes this one of the fastest games for the Sega Genesis. The momentum based physics, obstacles, and enemies makes this the perfect game for people who want to challenge their reflexes. This game tests your reflexes by giving you only split-seconds to react to the obstacles you are thrown at while going at top speed. I recommend this to anybody with a Sega Genesis--or at least for people who want to go through an enormous amount of speedy platforming.
The graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics "Myst" and "Alone in the Dark."

Sky Odyssey for PS2 is a much more fun and active flying game than this, but this is by no means chopped liver.  The graphics are often impressive, and the game does put up a fight in the later stages.  But as long as you aren't dumb enough to expect a NASA flight replicator, you might very well enjoy this little romp through the un-friendly skies.  Who knew terrorists would have the $$$ to own more jet fighters than most industrialized nations?

There he finds he's the only person who can rid that world of the evil and malevolent sorceress, Hecubah, and he can't go home until he does.  He can choose to follow the path of the warrior, conjurer or wizard, each with its own attributes, skills and challenges.  Your character is always male, but if you have something against the name Jack, you can change it, along with other physical attributes.

You can also choose certain types of games.  A campaign game involves a certain sort of goal (like escorting Joan of Arc to the king).  Their is a death match game, where you duke it out with other empires, and so much more.  There is a delightful training game which involves the famous William Wallace teaching you the basics of the game, I found this to be extremely helpful.

As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP< being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was the only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.

The missions are fun and fast paced, although it takes a while  to get used to and be able to handle the plane. Also in battle it's  sometimes hard to get the other planes, but the bombers you'll probably get  on your first try but it still takes a while to get the others.

On TV TOKYO,pokemon became a Anime in 1997. It became a hit,and was followed by Pocket Monsters Yellow in 1998. Electric Solider Porygon came out in December 12,1997. The bright blue and red lights caused seizures,a symptom when something the human brain cannot take recations. It causes all sorts of sideffects. Many Japanese children got headaches. As well as eye strain,vomiting,bloody noses and bloody mouths. Over 600 children were rushed to the hospital. No one died,but we're hurt. It hit the news in America,and many people criticised pokemon. They thought the Japanese series shouldn't come out in the US. 4Kids still released the pokemon anime in 1998,and still became a hit. However,the episode never came out anywhere outside Japan,even with repaired animations. It wasn't Porygon,but Pikachu. Pikachu used a thunderbolt attack,which hit the missile,and caused the bright lights. It went on for 5 seconds,and caused seizures. Don't watch the episode. It's not safe,for kids anyways. What's this have to do with Red and Green? Well,a story like this with the games were very similar. Lavender Town Syndrome. This is a myth,not true. The myth is about the music from Lavender Town. The myth is is that children who listened to the music got headaches from the load music straining on the Nintendo GameBoy systems speaker. This caused children to kill each other. This isn't true. If this was true,there would have been news reports on it,and pokemon would have been bann. Including Red and Blue. No one died. It might have been annoying to listen to it,but nothing happened. The Japanese music is not the same as the American music. The American version isn't a strong. Anyways,pokemon still was considered violent. But,this has nothing to do with the Syndrome. It has to do with the Cards,Games,and Anime. Watch this one YouTube:Pokemon on the news. Look for pokemon news report 1999. It will talk about it. For one thing,they are all trolls. They all say pokemon wrong. They also say how violent and brutle it was. It's not a message of violence. It's clearly rated E for everyone for every box. Well sure,you go around catching monsters and they beat the crap out of each other,but really,it's not like there killing each other. They aren't. Also,the games are good to improve reading skills. It's bann from every single School across the country. 16 years later and it's still bann. Mostly the Cards. All for violence? Really? No. Not worth it. Well,4 months after the insistent,pokemon was back on in Japan in April of 1998 on TV TOKYO. Then,in September 8th of 1998,pokemon hit the US as a popular Anime.

Plus, I love the fact that your main character, Cloud, has a flawed memory (spoiler, I know, but who doesn't know the story of FF7 by now?).  Because you see the events of the game through his eyes, you never quite know what actually happened, and  what is the product of his confusion. I believe that having a less than 100% reliable narrator makes for a much more interesting story for the player because it keeps you guessing.  Loads of RPGs feature narrators/main characters with some sort of amnesia, but this is one of the few games I've seen that that actually puts a large focus on "unreliable narration". Some people have complained that FF7's story is confusing and poorly told, but I strongly disagree.  Stories in literature that feature "unreliable narration" (Edgar Allen Poe used this alot; he doesn't catch any flak for it!) are completely legitimate ways of telling a story.  In the case of Final Fantasy 7, it serves to let the player know (in a dynamic and creative way) that Cloud is possibly psychologically unstable. If you pay attention to the game (you might need multiple playthroughs to catch it), you can figure out what's really going on.  This is in direct contrast to a game that just has a crap story and doesn't make any sense because of poor writing (for an example of this sort of game, see my Grandia III review).

  Multiplayer can be more fun. You basically go through a skirmish against 1 to 3 other players, whether controlled by the computer or a human. The items will apply, and you can turn them on or off by playing 50 multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch. After you end the time limit with more points than all other players / if everyone else is out of lives, you get ranked 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th, and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank, which you can look over.
My brothers and I still find ourselves playing this game through start to finish.  It loses nothing, remains that perfect tradeoff between challenge and ease that we have dubbed "fun."  We know the music by heart, the levels by intuition, which buttons deploy a cape or snake out Yoshi's tongue.

Conker's Bad fur day
Every body who has played this game knows that the story line is what makes FFVII live up to its title. You are an ex SOLDIER member and joined a group called AVALANCE to stop Shinra (the bad guys) from using all the energy from the planet. WHY?! Because stealing stuff from the planet is not good, that's why. On your way from destroying a mako reactor (steals energy), you run into a pretty flower girl. That whose name I will not say, it's a secret. One of your beginning characters is Barret who is the leader of Avalanche, and with him is Tifa who runs the bar they all hide at, and she also watches his daughter Marlene. Cloud use to live with Tifa in their town called Nibelheim, surprised to see Cloud she runs up to him and asks him how he has been over the past 5 years since they have seen each other.
Every stage you go through in the game (with the exception of Grant's final level) is packed to the brim with a riddiculous number of soldiers, janitors, raptors, compys, spitters, and even a triceratops or two. How do you deal with these threats? Here's a hint. You run. You run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can. While the whole point of JPRE is to be an action packed game where you shoot every living thing in sight, it's simply much more efficent to just run and jump your way to the exit (with this method, you can finish the game in about twenty minutes).

2059	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Yeah. So the story is very weak. Things are often like that for multiplayer-centered games. At least Mario Party had actually TRIED to spice things up with a story. Where's the story for Super Smash Bros.? Where's the story for Mario Kart 64? I didn't think so. As weak as the Mario Party story is, the story isn't important for a game...the gameplay is. Some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay. Other games with NO story succeed with great gameplay. Mario Party is definitely in the latter category. You can hate the Mario Party series for its excellent "Land Before Time" impression. You can be among the groups of people that prefer Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3. Yet there is one thing that you must admit. Mario Party was DARNED fun back in 1999! Sure, people said to NEVER play with one person, but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as well.
7194	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	From the mid to late 90's through the early early 2000's, Rare was on FIRE!  When teamed with Nintendo, they were a powerhouse developing blockbuster games 1 after another.  Donkey Kong 64 is no exception to that.  While it's totally different than Rare's original Donkey Kong Country series, this game definitely holds it own.  First off, this game is HUGE!  It's basically an open world platformer.  Very comparable to The Banjo Kazooie games on N64.  Lots of exploring, collecting, defeating enemies and bosses to advance the storyline.  The graphics are beautiful and actually required the Nintendo 64 to have an upgraded memory pack installed (which was included with the game.)  While the music isn't quite as memorable as the DK Country games, it's still very well done and fits the specific environments. I would highly recommend this to anyone who was a fan of Banjo kazooie or Mario 64 type gameplay.

The story involves your character on his search for the Garden of Eden Creation Kit for Arroyo, your tribal villiage founded by the original vault dweller (ie: the character you played in fallout).  He is your ancestor.  Along the way you get to interact with many intersting characters: humans, mutants, ghouls...mutated scorpions, weird cult people, and those much hated (by me) Deathclaws.  GRRR!  This games is about 5 times longer than the unfortunalty short Fallout and you get a car!  This speeds up movement on the game map.

8496	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Seriously, I played this game in highschool when it first came out.  The secrets are legendary, the graphics were state of the art CGI for its time, the characters are classic... so why hasn't this been re-released for the gameboy advance as all the other good super nes games have.  Where is it on the virtual console?  And most importantly, where is the sequel for the WII or the DS.  Come on now- Square and Nintendo settle your differences and produce another game that will be on par with Kingdom Hearts.

However, AOE2's greatest weakness is its lack of a cohesive  single-player campaign. Instead of a series of missions linked with a  cohesive storyline, you have several separate campaigns, each centering  around a different empire. So the missions are more like skirmishes than  really cohesive campaigns. Regrettably, Starcraft is still the king when it  comes to single-player campaigns.

The 2-player levels even have their own versions of the music.  The 2-player version of Casino Night has a peppier beat to it, and reminds me a bit of the Last Resort club music featured in Total Recall.  I personally think the 2-player version of the Emerald Hill Zone sounds better than the single player version.

The exploration amongst this crazy world is also very complex and intricate as you find cadeau that look like strange red peppers that will give you later use as you insert them into the slots of special consoles of some kind that you later find in such a complex world with the weirdest looking goons that you will come across. This game is alot like Legacy of Kain but more freaky and dark-like as you find evil dark souls hidden within govi objects and giant goons, and hunt down bad serial killers. And if that wasn't enough, there are many areas of the very weird and unique environments that you are not able to pass yet, such as hot burning coals as ground, bloody waterfalls outdoors and in condemned houses(yes you heard me right), deep acid water, rock barriors,etc, but once you find a certain artifact you will gain powers to allow to walk on the hot coals, swim in deep acid water and break rock barriors to go to new areas.

FF5: One of the previously unreleased FF games (at the time anyway) is now in America. I really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof. I literally trained my characters (this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game) to get to level 30 or 40 (can't remember exactly) just to get my jobs mastered. the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other FF games, this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of (X-Death) rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him/her instead of the one who is destroying the world. the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters (there's only 5 in the entire game, you stick with 4, one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter) so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters.

The music is enchanting and after 8 years I still go back and listen to it. The races that you'll encounter are just incredible. It is like the Odyssey, so I guess you can say it is a Space Odyssey of sorts. There are just so many strategies and tactics you can use with the multitude of units at your selection. The only limitation is your creativity.
6853	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Probably the most known genesis game of all time, as well as possibly being the most known Sonic game of all time, Sonic 2 is well deserving. This was actually the only game I owned for years when I was little, and it kept me busy! I still play it quite alot. My Genesis is still working, but I also have it on Sonic Mega Collection (which is how you'd play this game if your Genesis doesn't work). Sonic 2 is probably the best classic Sonic game (I just wish Tails could fly here), and is pretty much what defined that series in the first place: High speed action and frantic gameplay requireing good reflexes. You can either play as Sonic or Tails, or, you can play as Sonic and have Tails follow you around and mimic your moves, which can come in handy in bosses. Its much more effective, however, if you have a friend control Tails with a second controller. The fustrating thing about that is that the screen still scrolls with Sonic, the player controlling Tails will often get left behind and not reapear for a few moments. It also has a decent 2 player mode. This game is just about right challenge wise and is great for any age. And, in my opinion tottaly beats any classic Mario game hands down! Terrific classic game, an absolute must have if you're a Sonic fan!

The game takes some effort to learn, but is well worth it.  One of the nice features on two player is that if your partner dies, the screen becomes full-screen for the remaining player.  GREAT GAME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS!

Replay? As previously stated, the game has four scenarios not including bounus modes. Each scenario takes around two hours to complete. So, in a FAST play through there is eight hours of gameplay. In a regular session you could expect to take anywhere from six days to half a month finishing the two stories. Basically, there are TWO GAMES with this one game. You can start as Leon and finish as Clare, or Start as Claire and end as Leon. The stories change with both tellings and it is worth playing through both! Moreover, the bousus modes are decent. There are alternate costumes, a time attack mode, a Toffu Time attack mode (Where you play as a giant block of Tuffu), and Arrange Mode (Should you get the Dual Shock version). Arrange mode is basically a mode where they hold your hand for you. They give you a gun with infinite ammunition and let you go.

Blizzard's free online gaming service is fantastic.  Simple and easy to use, and it has everything from competitive 1vs1ing as well as team games of sizes anywhere from 2vs2 to 4vs4, massive 8-way free for alls and more!  I really enjoy playing this online with my friends.
The game teaches you to manage resources, how to overcome obstacles and how to build a military base in such a way that it is both practical and defensible. Do any of these things incorrectly and your forces will be overrun. You will also need to learn how to deal with tight situations, such as when enemy infantry are suddenly dropped in the back corner of your base where you have few defenses. You have to deal with threats like this quickly before they tear your base apart.

3843	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	System Shock 2 is most likely the scariest game I have ever played, Half-life being the only close contender.  As good as HL is, though, SS2 tops it with more storyline and depth and personality.  I'm an RPG fan and I'd consider SS2 more of an action game than an RPG, but the game still allows you to configure your character in ways that deeply affect the gameplay.  First time through I played as a psionics guy who wielded hand-to-hand weapons.  Late in the game I was able to use an invisibility psi power, run up to enemies, and whack the bejeezus out of them.  I didn't have to use guns much, and when I did I just used the cheesy little pistol.  Next time I play I'm going to specialize in guns and be a long-distance sniper.  The role-playing elements are not that deep, but I still greatly appreciate the opportunity to choose how my character develops.  That's why this game is better than Half-life.

First things first though, this game has some of if not the worst loading times of all time in my honest opinion. However, if you can imagine the top down perspective of Legend of Zelda: A link to the Past with the graphics that were full of drab dark colors, creating an almost gothic overtone, you might realize why this game was pushing the Playstation 1 to its proverbial limits.

But, nonetheless, an amazing game with lots of hidden areas to test your reasoning and gaming skills,- some of which made my head hurt for the first several years I owned my original copy- a fun premise & great for people of all ages. An expert can beat the game in about five hours, but doing so relies on much more than just simple skill, like most modern games. Even though the second & third entries were great (and, honestly, longer), I kind of regretted that they didn't take as much of an advantage of their environments as the first did. I guess, in closing, not as complex, but just as fun.

When the first King's Quest came out it was at the vanguard of game design.  Unlike the text adventure games common at the time (some of which had a few static graphics), here you could see your character moving around an actual environment and interacting with objects.  The games themselves are quite simple (basically, they are just treasure hunts where you have to find the right object and take it back to the correct character to trade for another object, etc.) but charming.  The interface on these earliest games are parser, as opposed to point and click, meaning (with the exception of movement by cursor keys) you have to type in commands in order to tell the character what to do.  This had its disadvantages (at times, you know what to do but not how to say it), but it also had its advantages (there was less room for guessing by just clicking your inventory objects on the hotspot one at a time).

For a platform gamer, this game has a nice blend of 3D motion with 2D side scrolling in a colorful environment that was pretty good visually for the graphics at the time. It definitely took you to a different world. The music for the various levels was appropriate and entertaining. Come on, remember Hog Wild? Good times riding that boar! It had a very linear type of progression but it was not too unlike Super Mario World with the coin shaped levels on the overworld map. The bonus rounds were indeed difficult but you could always replay them, minus the saving bonuses once you saved, and never lose lives in the bonus rounds. Aku aku was there in my time of need, especially when toxic barrels were bouncing my way. He is a different but unique take on the power ring or mushroom, flower, star buffs from the other iconic heroes. I am not saying Crash Bandicoot is better than other platform games before him, but he is unique and has his own style that improved in the titles that came after. I give this game a 9 out of 10 or 4.5 stars.

There are not a great variety of guns, though, but really great. The multiplayer also rocks (including Counter strike). The AI are probably the smartest of all videogames. They duck, strafe, group up like real soldiers. If they see you at a distance, they'll throw a grenade. The aliens are really cool.

3720	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Virtua Fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as DOA2, or tekken tag, but believe me this was what paved the way for those games.  All though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters, virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles (drunken style, mantis, sumo, etc.).  I was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games.  Even with new games on the market, I think i'll be playing this one for a while.  The teacher of fighting games.
Some people hate the leveling system in this game, but once you understand it, it's really fun to aim for perfect stats. Basically, you are required to hunt down these beasts across the world map that become Guardian Forces once you've defeated them in battle. Sure, you can summon them in battles, but I never do that. I concentrate more on the junction options they give to your characters: Health, Physical Strength, Vitality, Magic and Endurance against Magic. Maxing these stats out to 255 each is real fun and challenging. Combine this with hunting down extremely rare items during your travels so you can refine them into powerful weapons and command abilities, and you're going to have your hands full for a couple of months. Thankfully, for some people, you do not need to do any of this to play and beat the game, but to me, it's another reason why I like this game.
5502	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	The blitz series in my opinion is the most action for a sports game yet. I like realistic, franchise, challenging games and war strategy games. But this game in my opinion is the best multiplayer game for Nintendo ever.
What it has is the ability to get right under your skin, suck you in, and keep you playing.  What's eerie is how much you feel like you're in the game when the graphics really aren't much to speak of (especially compared to today's games).
The summonings (also known as GF's, Eidolons, Espers, Aeons etc...)have been made more complicated by making it so that you can use them to learn new commands like turning monsters into cards. However as a party you can become very dependant on these monsteres because it is so much easier just to watch them take off heaps of damage reagrdless of what you do instead of attempting to get a weapon upgrade. And watching the cutscene of them killing monsters over and over again can get tiring very quickly. What I do is only use them in boss battles and try and learn J-Atk as quickly as possible to increase your own attack......you'll understand.
Where the game really excels in my opinion is how you choose to way to end the game.  You can end at getting the weapons to their final place and launch the space shuttle, or you can go and get all the collectibles and open planetary travel.  Going through the planet levels is fun and trying to earn all gold medals and then platinum is very challenging and will really up your skills.
Here Luigi is not required for this is Mario's solo adventure! In this game you are not in the Mushroom kingdom or the dream world of Subcon, instead you are in a weird place called Sarasaland where a new princess named Daisy was kidnapped by an alien named Tatanga.

3555	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	You just have to buy one they have the same graphics as PS2 and Gamecube have which is 128 bits and the only thing I really don't like about it since it is the first CD game system sometimes when you are in the middle of playing a game it may just go to the system's main menu but that is very common if that happens just take the CD out and clean it by rubbing the CD on your shirt.  When you want to stop a game you first hit open and than take the game out than close the disk door than hit power because if you just hit power than open it up it will not put on the brake.  Which can damage the Dreamcast.
  I love my dreamcast and play it regularly however A lot of the reason I enjoy it so much is because during my peak of gaming this is the system I had. If you missed the dreamcast growing up think twice and try it before you buy. Some of the happiest times were playing games like Nfl 2k1 when they came out or if a childhood friend came to visit. If you jump from next gen into dreamcast without experiencing it as when it was the NEW thing, your content with the console may not be as much as some reviewers will say. You kind of had to experience it IMO to fully enjoy it.

Story (score 10/10): The story, too, is excellent.  I was thoroughly engaged by it; it has just the right balance of character development and intriguing plot points to keep you entertained. I've played this game at least six times now over the years and I'm still not sick of it.
For one thing, I never quite agreed with Ultima Online's system of player killing.  For those of you not familiar with this term, that means that any "Joe Bob" on the internet can kill your character as soon as he/she leaves a town.  It doesn't make the game any fun especially when you consider how many kids out there play this game and have nothing better to do than player kill all day long.
An annoying thing I realized is that sometimes you just can't defeat the other opponent even if you rush in with 150+ aircrafts if vehicles, kbots, or ships cannot do so. There are times when it will seem to be like a tie and I save the game and deal with it later. I'm talking about playing against the comp. btw...Playing against other players is great when you learn more about the game.

I won't reveal much of the plot, since it isn't particularly complicated or long, but all in all this game is great, though you can get sucked into it if you're not careful.  The quiet, haunting intro theme is enough to leave you feeling as though you too, like your character, might possibly get sucked into an alternate dimension.

Try it. I think you will like it.
Killer Instinct has a story in there that no one cared for so you just jump into the action. Pick a character and you'll see the line of characters you must fight one after the other. Each character has his/her/its own moves waiting to be discovered. The game gets you acquainted to a combo system where you can string together certain moves to start a combo chain. The longer the chain, the more you get to beat up the opponent and take off more energy. To make it interesting (and to stop players from over dominating matches), each character has a "combo breaker" move: a certain combo then when you execute after someone tries to chain a combo, that character breaks out of it and hits your opponent at the same time. When your opponent loses all of his/her energy, you get the chance to end the match by either knocking him/her off the stage or by doing an "end special": a special move that you execute to unleash a barrage of combo hits earning you an "ultra combo" (40 or more hits in a row.) If you take too long to finish your opponent, he/she comes back to life with a little bit of energy and is extra powerful. Alongside the main mode, you can get used to the controls in the practice mode, tweak the game setting in the options screen, take on another player in the 2 player VS mode and tournament mode, where up to 8 players can duke it by passing the controller around.
 A gameplay tip I would like to mention is that most people say that to get the full experience you have to put a lot of stat points in intelligence and wisdom because this opens up more dialogue options and story elements.  I am not sure how much is necessary to get everything, but just thought I'd pass that along.  I created a mage and had them both very, very high.
833	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I highly recommend this game as a GREAT classic. It will feel dated and look terribly pixelated on your 90" screen, but it is a game worth playing. Pull it out for a day of "Reminiscent Gaming" or as a chance to dive deeper  into the universe that is Zelda.
So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party.

But for many years I saw pictures of this game like in magazines and I thought the game was worth buying for just the graphics. Well it has much more than just graphics going for it. Never having played the original from 1993, what I do know is Masterpiece Edition has improved graphics and features. It's nice to see a Rated E game that's fun to play. It's the kind of game even recommended to those who think video games have contributed to the downfall of American society. It's also truly a recommended game if you are sick and tired of those slasher or shoot 'em up games. The game is stuffed with puzzles where you have to open up secret passages, look for clues, activate a spaceship, a tree elevator, or whatever, in order to look for missing pages from a book. The only drawback is some of the quests are a bit on the tedious side. But to make things easier, just write down clues on paper, writting some of this stuff on paper would help save time (some of it is crucial). This package also comes with a screensaver with soundtrack CD. If you like the music from the game enough, then you have this CD to hear the music on a regular CD player. As for the game itself, the graphics are wonderful, and in many places are quite realistic (of course there are other scenes that look obviously like computer graphics). I'm glad to to finally get Myst, and I look forward to getting the sequels.

The game's only real downfall comes from the fact that the story isn't anywhere near as compelling as the other games, as it just takes place in the same time frame as RE2. Well, specifically, the first half of the game starts a day before the events of RE2 and then the second half picks up several days after that game. Basically, the plot consists of Jill Valentine (star of the first game, and thankfully NOT played by the same voice actress!) trying to escape the streets of the T-Virus infested Raccoon City, all the while avoiding getting killed by the Nemesis (a crazed rocket wielding monster who's out to kill STARS members). There's nothing really surprising to the story, although Jill does encounter numerous mercenaries from Umbrella's evacuation fighting squad. Carlos is the only one Jill spends the most time with and he resembles sort of a love interest for her. Capcom doesn't really succeed as much with these two as say the relationship between Ada and Leon or the young girl Sherry's affection towards Claire, both in the previous game. Still, there are multiple paths and different endings to achieve, so plenty of replayability is here. Thankfully, any fallacy of the story is more than made up for by the gameplay.

Basically, though it's graphics resemble the SNES Tales of Phantasia, the game is still good.  Graphics, to me, don't make the game--its the story.
All in all, Half-Life is great. I'd highly reccommend it for anyone wanting story, gameplay, replayability, and fun in one big package. Don't forget the thousands of downloadable levels online- The Rats style levels, in which you are 6 inches tall in a bathroom/kitchen/livingroom/ect., are personal favorites.

6034	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	One of a handful of decent expansion packs, this takes the original plot of 'Half-Life' and looks at it from the perspective of one of the 'grunts' sent to 'pacify' the disaster site at Black Mesa. That said, your original  mission becomes quickly subverted due to unforseen intervention, and you  find yourself rushing through a 'Half-Life' parallel universe, sometime  intersecting with the original game. It's essentially more of the same, but  shorter (a terrible shame), although you get an expanded arsenal, and some  useful allies. There's more of an emphasis on multi-character soldier vs  soldier battles than before, and at times this could easily have been  'Kelly's Heroes : The Game', such was the war film atmosphere. Whilst  'Half-Life' finished with a dissapointing trek through an alien world, 'OF'  sticks closely to reality (although you can beam yourself into 'Zen' if you  so desire). The tragic, tragic shame of it all is that you'll probably  finish it in a couple of days, as it isn't very big. Roll on 'Half-Life 2'.

This game carries on straight from Sonic 2. The Death egg crash lands on Angel island, and Eggman meats the owner; Knuckles. Knuckles makes friends with Eggman, and gets convinced that Sonic & Tails are bad guys! So when Eggman hears that there is a master emerald on the island making it float, Eggman tells Knuckles that Sonic is after it. Sonic is having a break, flying in the Tornado Bi-plane with Tails, when he notices the island. Sonic is keen to explore, but Knuckles steals all of south islands chaos emeralds from Sonic! Plus he sees badniks roaming the place. So Sonic sets off to stop Robotnik and get the emeralds back. The plot twists and turns, and in the end it turns into Sonic, Tails and Knuckles fighting Eggman in space. Here's a list of the awsome levels!

8112	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When I heard that this game was in devolpment many moons ago, I was  apprehensive because I had played Vampire the Masquerade for a couple years  and loved the detailed and rich world created by White Wolf. After buying  the game though, the pro's really outweigh the cons. First off, Activision  decided that they would fraction the normal 'dot' system to extend overall  game play by slowing the rate at which a character can grow. (Through  truthfully, they could have applied the experience rules as is, but I see  the logic here.)  Veteran players will also notice a lack of Disciplines  and some addational costs to usually free ones (ie. Potence and Fortitude.)  in an effort to prevent abuse of them. (I won't bring up the lack of  Skills, Talents, and Knowledge...)

Unlike most traditional RPG's the enemies are not Randomly Generated. For example, in Final Fantasy you move around a area and all of a sudden you are pulled into battle. This is not the case here. While you are traveling through areas in this game you can see the enemy and engage in combat with them by walking into them. From this you can either surprise them and attack first, or if they run into you they get the first strike. All in all, a very interesting concept. There are so many other things I could go into, but I won't give it away.

The glitches that plagued it on ps1 and ps2 don't carry over to ps3. on ps3 its fast, dosnt slow when you have alot of troops, things build and move faster and seems to be funner on the ps3 (it works on the ps3 slim as well, thats what I use.)

However, it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other Myst games.  As well as a number of smaller puzzles, there are two major puzzles to be solved, clues for which are scattered throughout the islands.  Even with the smaller puzzles, the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away, or only accessible via a very circuitous route.  This can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles.  Having said that, there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Riven.  The puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the game.
The combat, while  fun and reminiscent of Diablo, only keeps its spark for the first part of  the game.  Most of it consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting until  you've hit them enough times for them to die.  A big flaw that becomes  noticable during the first few levels is that the enemies wait until you  are in range before they attack.  They will simply stand idle as you  slaughter others in the same room!  As the game progresses you will gain  party members, and will bemoan similarly incompetant AI.  I equipped one  with a bow and laughed in disbelief as he continuously fired in to a wall  when he should have moved a couple steps to the side before doing so.  Also, you can control the other members of your party in combat, but the  main character will stop fighting while you are doing so!  Aaahhhh!  Add to  this that you can go through entire areas and clean up with little to no  problem, but then come across certain areas that will be nigh impossible to  pass.  Both enemies and your fellow party members will get hung up on  walls, doors and other obstacles in the room.
Each act focuses to a different extent on action vs. adventure gaming and can be played in any order (I recommend doing them in order unless you get stuck and can't get help immediately).  Act 1 and Act 2 are an excellent balance, Act 3 is mainly action, and Act 4 is mainly puzzle solving.  Each Act is also wildly different in its villians and settings, so you never grow bored, and the characters are very well realized and leave you wanting to experience more adventures with them (there are rumours that this will be made into a TV series!).
if you stick it onto Sonic 3 and you'll get the massive adventure that Sega wanted to release all along - in other words The best SONIC GAME EVER.

It's probably the hardest going through the tournaments (all three of them) with Goldust because his energy seems to drain very quickly, and it's probably the easiest to complete these tournaments with Shawn Michaels or the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith because they have MANY power moves that finish your opponent off very quickly.
5506	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Okay, sure. The graphics may be a little poor and the game play may be a little hard especially because this game is a side-scroller, but this is still I would think the greatest MK ever. This game goes beyond the tournament and the story rules. Mythologies goes back into the past, before the orginal Mortal Kombat. As Sub-Zero, you must find the symbols that represent the elements and defeat totally cool bosses. By far, the best part of the game is the end level, which takes you into the maze of Quan Chi's fortress where you later meet up with him and the original Shinnok. This MK game is a must-have for any Mortal Kombat fan who enjoys MK's dark storylines more than the tournamet fights.

Perfect Dark was released in 2000 and you control Joanna Dark, a secret agent who sets out to investigate a shady corporation and it is set in the future. It packed twice the punch of Goldeneye in the way of better graphics, awesome music, smarter A.I.

Perfect Dark was so much fun to play, with or without your friends.

My brother bought it for Playstation on a whim, having never either played or heard of Myst (I still haven't played it), and I played the game alongside him, both of us consulting the walkthrough the whole time (something I now do not condone, but we were young - what do you expect?), and thoroughly enjoying it.

I know this is an old game and the graphics don't stand up to the ones of today, however the strategic gameplay and brilliantly detailed story make up for the graphics.

This  game was made by Pandemic, the same people that created Battlezone 2 (BZ2).  This was a game that was prone to crashes (especially on NVIDIA videocards)  and was infested with all manner of game-crashing bugs. Basically, BZ2 was  a game that could've been a classic if it hadn't been for those horrible  bugs.

2077	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I have to admit, as much as I want to praise this game, it is mostly wasted potential.  Even though this game came out in the later stage of the N64's run, it has the graphics of a third party release title. (Read: They're not all that great.)  Everything about the game reaches towards high concepts, but almost nothing reaches its goal.  The idea is that you are a timetraveling hero who has to save the world from various attacks from interstellar insects throughout history.  While the story is pure fluff, the gameplay (at least in theory) is not.  DMA is well known for the Grand Theft Auto series of games, and Body Harvest follows a similar formula.  You shoot things, then you get into various vehicles and shoot more things.  The main difference is that in Body Harvest you don't want to run innocent people over.
9651	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I have loved every Pokemon game I have every played, and this one is by no means an exception. Pokemon Snap for the N64 game system is fun and very easy to play. Young children (ages 6+) would be able to through it with little difficulty and enjoy it. The object of the game is to go around taking pictures of pokemon that you encounter in different worlds or levels. Some pokemon are a little more difficult to find, but throughout the game you are given hints to give you an idea of what to do in order to find them. The Professor then rates those pictures based on certain criteria. If you get a certain number of points for your picture skills, you unlock a new world. There are only a handful of worlds, so you can get through the game within an hour. It is fun going through the levels multiple times to take better pictures than before, but after awhile, it gets a little boring. Still, once or twice a year, it is fun to take the game out of its storage and play it again, reliving childhood memories. If you have not played this game, I think it is something you will enjoy.
Overall, I spent a lot of time on this game. I could have beaten it a lot faster, but that wouldnt be any fun, because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself.
In 98 this game was jst a instant classic, despite being overshadowed by loads of games(especially Metal Gear Solid, and Zelda:Ocorina of time).  It's definitly unknown since GTA 3 and Vice City overshadowed it by a loooong mile, but yet I still play this game from time to time.  In this game you could even say ... the police and let them eat the gat, take out a squad of them with a machine gun, blaze them up with a flame thrower, or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcher(That was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy).  If you're used to GTA 3 or Vice City, then this game will hardly be interesting to you, but if you have this game, then I'm sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you, and took you on the crazy ride from this, all the way to vice city.
- No Co-Operative mode. The main game is just one player again, but there is a 2-player mode, just not working together to beat a stage.
There are all three secret cap levels that are a lot of sun as well, including flying.  "Super Mario Bros. 3" may be the first time Mario flew, but it was "Super Mario 64" that Mario really took to flight like never before.  Also the Princess's Secret Slide is a lot of sun fun, and houses the most obscure star of them all (you must beat the slide under 21 seconds, and the most surefire way to do that is actually jump off the slide and land down much farhter)

For most of the game you play as Tarzan, as a adult and as a kid, Terk in the camp level, and the amusing Jane sequence.  The graphics are very good, capturing the spirit of a jungle, with lots of creatures wondering around, light from treetops and lots more.  Disney has always been good in delivering great music that is enjoyable all by itself and Tarzan is no diffrent, with bongos, drums and the themes from the movie.
You are the unseen ruler of one of 13 uinque ancient civilizations. Your objective is to either strive to conquer with a strong military, find and bank three religious relics, or build a wonder to increase the prestige of your civilization. Each time you play you can pick which civ. you want to be, what civ. your enemies and allies are, what objective you are to meet, the difficulty level, the location of your game, how many resources you start out with, and what age ( Dark, Feudal, Feudal, Castle, Umperial) your civ will begin in. Oh, and don't forget about your population limit!
Mario Party is a great single player and multiplayer game. And can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date I find this to be one of the best of the Mario Party series. With this I give this game an overall score of 8.5/10!
2.  Colorful, archaic,  fantasty-land-type graphics.  Journeys through time and through the looking  glass.  A spell system that reverses itself, with hilarious results.
Well until Diablo II comes out (as many have said) you could do a  lot worse than this game.
Why do some zombies take more bullets than others?  Why do zombies respawn in some areas?  What's up with all the backtracking in this game?  You're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE?  These are some of the questions you'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica.  Has the series evolved?  If you get past the improved graphics, the answer is NO.  The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1, albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode (you burn through bullets faster this way).  A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required, which may have been good back when the series was young, but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.
Lunar Silver Star Story Complete originally came with a lot of extras.  A soundtrack CD filled with the best tracks, a cloth map, a making of CD and a hardcover instruction booklet that even included a sample of the strategy guide made by Working Designs themselves.

William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth.
The music and sounds are also very good. The tunes are memorable and who doesn't love the sound of collecting 1ups?

There are two ways to win the game. One is to take over the world and be the last civilization standing. The other for the non war monger is the spaceship path. Be the first to build a space ship and reach Alpha Centrui and you win. There is also the run out of time and have the highest score victory if all else fails and you reach the last year.  There are 5 different difficulities so there are many options for how tough you want the computer opponents to be. You can either manhandle em or be humbled, either way it still is fun.

I take off the 1.9 because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game. The boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn, hoping you have enough left to finish him off. This makes the usual fun boss fights, a little less fun than normal. Atleast they're challenging, though, since they always have the same level as your characters. I didn't take off any more for the semi-basic storyline, and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out. That's something you have to realize when playing this game: it was one of the best for it's time.
The main gameplay has Mario go fetch a key and then use the key to open up a locked door to move on. The levels are clever, fun to play, and just downright cool. In fact, Mario can use acrobatic skills to help him through the levels. He can somersault, flip, and perform handstand jumps.

You play Alucard, a blood relative of the evil Dracula, in your quest to put the evil of your family line to rest.  Most Castlevania games feature whip-wielding Belmonts as the main character, but trust me - Alucard is the ultimate video game hero.  His aloof yet admirable personality, sword skills, and awesome appearance make him a hero that you can truly be proud to play as.  Alucard is a major contributor to the trend in good video games to make a more complex protagonist.

There are other minor bugs - icons don't consistantly draw in, and multi-player bugs are slightly annoying. The game itself is WAY too short when played in single player mode. Multi-player gets old really quickly, as you run around trying to kill each other over and over again. How about cooperative quests, like in BG?

It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception.  It's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult, rather, it's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.

There is "aku-aku," which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies. Take 3 aku-akus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch.
Those two problems are my only real gripes with StarCraft. The units are interesting, the characters (and voice-acting) are fantastic, and the three races are very well-balanced.

You have a plot that interconnects with 108 different characters that can be recruited at their perspective times, but unless you are a completionist, you will be extremely disappointed in the ending you will get. Now, whether or not you want to spend $100 on this is entirely up to you. I spent it, and I felt I somewhat got my money's worth, but at the same time, a little disappointed that I spent this much on a game, but oh well, there is worse, like $400 for Panzer Dragoon Saga. Anyways, just like with any other Suikoden entry, you can go to war with the kingdom whom the main character is opposing with, and use all kinds of tactics in battle that will determine your fate. The story is pretty solid, and the character development is also quite solid as well, and you have a lot of lush, beautiful environments to traverse through, with a world map. Overall, this game is good, but be prepared to drop a fraction of your wallet if you want this.

In any case, I personally recommend Mischief Makers to any gamer who can tolerate mostly-two-dimensional side-scrollers.

It's just so morbid, you feel like your in the game.  No joke.  If I see a zombie, I start to wig-out.  It draws you in.  I really can't describe it.  The only way you'll know what I'm talking about is to play the game.  It's the greatest.
To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself "I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage".  It's not like that in Super Mario World."

8810	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is what ALL other fighting games to this day strive for and don't pull off. This game was released in 1994, it's 2010 and this game is still one of the most coveted video games in existance. How can this game be a rip off when it pioneered the fighting genre of video games? The innovation this game's developers brought to the plate was WAY ahead of it's time...why do you think there were so many Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter releases? Granted those games were fun as well, but they had their work cut out for them. 2 games, 4 ports (K.I. 1&2 arcade, K.I. SNES, & K.I. Gold) put a lot of the games from the last decade to shame end of story close the book.

36	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is. Like everything else Microsoft makes- it doesn't work. When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time. To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min. to accomplish. If you want another disappointment from Microsoft, buy some "Games for Windows Live" games.  I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting. If that's what you want, don't buy this. If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game, then buy it.  oh, one more thing, every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working (there's Windows 7 for you)
It's fun, it's scary, and it is one hell of a ride. Ultimatley, Resident Evil 2 will give some nightmares. If the first one scared you, get ready to be terrified again!
Finally, for the last pro, other cool characters than the ones mentioned are here(they are not as cool as King, Yoshimitsu, Nina, Jin, Bryan Fury, who's also here, Paul, Gun Jack, Heihachi Mishima, the second to last boss, Hwoarang, Kazuya Mishima, here without first mention, or Lei Wulong, who also is here without the first mention, but they still really, really rock and I love them all) They include Anna Willaims, a great villain who not only is better than Ogre but also Nina's sister, Julia Chang, a good looking woman and a skilled fighter, but she really has got to do something about her hair, Eddy Gordo, a really cool 50-Cent like hero who dresses in yellow & green, Forest Law, brother of the awesome Marshall Law who he's just as fast & skilled as, Kuma, a cool looking grizzly bear fighter who really knows how to bring down the house(literally)and Panda, her brother is Kuma and she is cute if not a little bit of a softie. Oh well, she's a pretty decent fighter if you know how to use her. Nuff said

The PROS: Nintendo took the first game and expanded it into a brand new game while keeping the same concept and controls. It paid off big time as Kirby's Dream Land 2 is even more fun to play. The graphics looked great and the new music is as cheerful as ever while the controls work just as good as before. Adding abilities to Kirby like absorbing enemy powers and teaming up with animals adds new twists to the gameplay. There are more levels and they are longer now so it's not as short as the first game. The battery backed save and exclusive colors when you play the game on the Super Game Boy round out an overall excellent game.

  There is more to horror gaming than just guns, blood, guts and linear story line.
Overall: 8/10 - Great game with an excellent reputation. Crash 2 and 3 surpass it slightly, but this is still an easy-on-the-brain, fun and original idea.
I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I've heard that the quality for them were not that great.
But Final Fantasy's core has always been its great storylines, and this installment has one of the best.  Characters develop and mature realistically, and you get to know each one intimately, almost feeling kinship with some of them.  The plot is suitably but not comically epic, and the main struggle plays out better than most Hollywood movies.  Nearly everyone will laugh and cry at various parts of the game, a feat precious few video games have ever accomplished.  From a storyteller's perspective the shocking twist at the game's midpoint is perhaps too easy a way to draw emotion from the player, but there is no denying its effectiveness, as it is one of the most memorable scenes in video game history.
4878	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoyed playing Suikoden II and consider it a fine addition to my RPG collection.  While neither Suikoden nor Suikoden II seem to be rated with the upper echelon of outstandingly stellar RPG, the storyline is engaging, the characters are interesting and the graphics are cool.  The graphics are so good, in fact, that players of the first Suikoden will recognize some old friends just by seeing them on the screen.  The goal is still to try and recruit as many characters as possible, and you will have to go on a few side quests here and there to get them all.  But it's worth it to unlock the entire story.  There are also some special characters you can get who are not mandatory to your quest but are fun to take into battle.  I don't think you'll be disappointed with Suikoden II.

After slowly metabolising impressions about this game, I found out it is a story with a moral, or let's say short phylosophycal tale. If you want to play one RPG on PC, I am sure this is the one you need to play.
For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage.

4743	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	this game is great because of many reasons, the main one being that you totally get pulled into the game and the characters on your team or "party" feel like real because all of them have a unique character, agenda, and background. furthermore, almost everyone you meet has something original to say to you. Of course after a while they will repeat. The game has a wide choice of install size too, from a huge 2 and a-litlle-bit gigabytes which will lower the loading times o a relatively small 317 mb which will make the game's load times long. The game is extremely long and can take from 1 to 5 and more days(depends on your skills, how often you save and whether you only do the main quest or if you do some or all of the subquests) The game is difficult on any difficulty level unless you follow the exact reccomended routes and not wander off to, you know, adventure. But if you save often, get the best armor and weapons for our characters, keep a lot fo potions with you and pause to think out your tactical moves, you should find the game extremely addictive and very fun! if you like Ad&D or if you really like rpg's, you will love this game. If you are new to the genre this will get you in the game and keep you in. If you aren't a fan of rpg's this is a good game to start with. If you want to try computer games, this might be a wee bit hard, unless you have playd AD&D.

Games: This is where the N64 had a huge advantage over the Playstation.  Mario '64, Mario Kart, both Zelda games, Goldeneye, and a few other "also mentions" (DK, Perfect Dark, etc.) all had huge fan bases that Sony just could not satiate.  The console wars hadn't quite devolved into "who has the best first-person shooter" yet, so gamers were still interested in adventure and racing contests.  Whereas Nintendo had all those classics, Sony's "hero" was Crash Bandicoot.  Yep.
It's no VII, but as a separate entity (which is often difficult to convince oneself to do) it is a decent game.  It's getting progressively more difficult to find, hence the price, but if you want to blast away 80+ hours and reminisce on games before the 2000s, I'd recommend this one most definitely.

The  single player components are very entertaining and the story line is top  notch. I want to emphasize that because it is one of the best qualaties of  the game. The multiplayer part of starcraft is what keeps me playing. I am  really wondering if this game will ever get old to me, but it hasn't yet.  This game is perfect for somebody who wants a game for the fun-factor and  re-playablity.
Imagine watching a bad, low-budget science fiction film whilst playing a modern homage to 'Star Raiders' and you have the game in a nutshell. END
1656	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I actually did purchase this game two times.  I lent it out some years ago and never got it back. I recently noticed that the price is very modest so I picked it up again.  Why? This game is an older generation game (PS1), but it is better than some PS2 games I have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time.  Tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around, slice necks from behind, and hide out on rooftops. You will avenge the death of a crooked merchant, rescue a captive nijna, save a princess, destroy a fiendish cult, stop the spanish pirates, and fight a big boss with a bigger sword. Of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you.  Its lots of fun running around, hiding, killing from the unseen.  Its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing.  This game has very catchy music that brings you you right in. The graphics, like I said, are mediocre, but that won't make or break a game anyway. Gameplay makes the game and this game has plently. Plenty of enemies to defeat, two selectable characters, a bunch of ninja items to utilize, and the percect amount of levels.

And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before. This game is like doom, you know the one where you just see the weapon. Dont' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat.

9357	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Great
857	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money. Uneven gameplay,and few options plague this game,it is also way too short even at this reduced price. Spend your money on a game,just not this one. Hope this helps,I hate to have games collecting dust,but this is one of those and I own about 50 recent games so I know what's what.
4740	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love Castlevania and this is the best 2D Castlevania ever made. Unfortunately I didn't buy a copy 10 years ago so I guess I'll have to download it on Xbox Live Arcade since price gouging has come to the PlayStation version, I traded in my old PlayStation and I heard that it isn't compatible with the PS2s backwards compatability mode (a shame).
In this game, you get to play as Yacko, Wacko and Dot and try to avoid being captured and being placed in the water tower (I don't know much about the plot of the game). If one or two of the Animaniacs get captured, you can go to the water tower and try to make it to the top to free them.

Secondly, because I'm more a roleplayer, I find the lack of choices in actions somewhat stifling. Yes, I would as a rule choose to go and do the heroic thing, but you don't really get any choice to even be reluctant, go get help, or anything else. You work alone, you volunteer automatically, and so on.
  Graphically the game is a stunner. It looks like a million bucks, even on my average PC. The levels of object detail are (or were) unprecedented for shooters. Architectural design is often stunning, locations are both realistic and fantastically creative: Mafia hideouts are appropriately sleazy and opulent, a bizarre Goth-pagan nightclub thumps techno beats that become as chilling as any Resident Evil backgound noises. Object interactivity is high with lots of openable cabinets hiding powerup goodies, flushable toilets, and vending machines that drop snacks and pop!
-The new feature of playing as either X or Zero. SIMPLY AWESOME. You could do that in the previous game, but here is where you can choose who to play through the entire game. X is better for shooting long range, whereas Zero is more of a melee fighter.
I received a full refund for this purchase over the weekend in response to me negative experience with the product description.  I would like to emphasize the the controller works flawlessly on my PS1, and I would have had no complaints what so ever if I had purchased the controller for that purpose.  The controller arrived on time and everything else about my experience was delightful.
There's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each (Counting 100 coin stars), with stars for rewards. Those stars help you unlock more levels.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Unbalance Economy:  Simply put, the amount of money running around  in the game doesn't balance out against the cost of most items.  Local  Militia, for example, can be trained for $750, a sum so small by comparison  to what your mines are turning out that it doesn't even enter into your  strategic thinking.  Similarly, the rewards for completing quests in the  game are ludicrously small wnen compared to your income.  What do you say  to a major NPC who is trying to get you to do some major quest by offering  you 20K dollars.  "Hello, I make more than that in a single day of  mining.  Why should I bother?".  The numbers on a lot of this stuff  need to be adjusted. 2.  A preponderence of innefectual hand guns:  For  some reason, most of the mercs that you can afford at the start of the game  come equipped with hand guns rahter than assault rifles.  Excuse me?  A  professional merc who's going to airdrop into the middle of a civil war  with only a pistol?  This is particularly ludicrous when you realize how  innefectual handguns are in this game.  Even at close range, an NPC is  likely to die of old age long before you ever manage to finish him off with  a .38 revolver. Adding to this problem is the fact that you can't buy  rifles.  Oh sure, the nice mail order company that you do business with  will send you ammo, but not big guns, grenades, night vision goggles, or  any of the really cool stuff that you want to play with.  To get that  stuff, you have to ever so slowly find it off the bodies of dead enemies.  In the course of 15 hours of play, I managed to find only two rifles.  Unfortunately, they were of a calliber that I couldn't buy ammo for.  Arrg.  Why can't you just buy decent armaments in this game?
Id say forget the first three and star with: enter the dragonfly and legend series

5543	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	This controler stinks.  The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle (so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up), the rubber grips fall off in the first week, and worst of all, it's confusing.  I tried programing the buttons (because it's "fully programable") and believe it or not it works!  sure you can't train whole sets of commands (like moves in fighting games) in, only replot the buttons but it works.  The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden, none of the buttons perform the X action.  Then, this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine.  Enjoy!:(
At the very beginning of the game, when I looked inside that giant item box beside the typewriter, I couldn't believe Capcom was so generous as to give me more than enough ammo right from the beginning.  I really mean it- you receive a LOT of ammo from your item box.  After beating the game, I had a ton of ammo leftover.  Now, I realize people will probably look at this as a bad thing, and complain that lots of ammo greatly decreases the challenge and makes progressing through the game a cakewalk.  They'd also have a point if they wanted to complain that giving you loads of easily-available ammo straight from your item box doesn't really define "strategy game", since you aren't spending the majority of your time dodging enemies- you can simply walk up to them and shoot them and have *more* than enough ammo available for the next enemy you encounter.  They'd be absolutely correct, on both counts.
A lot of players have voiced a strong dislike for the materia system, claiming it kills the variety of your characters. The common consensus says that by giving the player the ability to assign any skill or spell to any character, Square has basically given you a bunch of clones with which to do battle. I'd have to disagree. If you really want to nitpick and pay attention to the specifics of each character's stats like that, you'll notice that each character has a different affinity to the various materia commands in the world. Sure, you can give anybody in your party the ability to cast "fire," but it's going to cause more damage if you give it to someone with an inherently high magic ability. Square's kept the variety in this cast, they've simply given you the ability to ignore each character's strengths and sculpt an army on your own accord.

In this game you have 5 characters to choose from, 3 being Battletoads and the other being Double Dragon. This game has a pretty good soundtrack in my opinion especially the first levels theme song. You have pretty average fights in this game, punches, kicks, super punches which make your hands grow big if you punch while running towards the enemy. This is an excellent game, the best on the Super Nintendo platform. One of the funnest things in this game could have been riding on those cars, that was very entertaining.

I had been a big fan of the other street fighter titles and had spent many a quarter playing this one in the arcades before the release date. It was an awesome game on the genesis so long as you had the six button controller (anyone playing fighting games on the genesis without one is insane lol), great variety of characters compared to the earlier titles. The voices on the genesis port were lacking, but IMO the awesome gameplay and graphics for its time made up for that. I was young when I was playing these games, but still own my genesis collection and still play em from time to time, a must have for any classic fighting game collector.

The PROS: For what it brings to the table, it's a good game. While the story is not the most original, it's enough to get you into the game. The animation is decent, sound effects & music are good and the controls take some getting used but thanks to the game's tutorial mode, it isn't a problem that lasts long. It's a long game and beating it on all the difficulty levels to unlock the extra content gives plenty of incentive. While playing it on easy mode gets you used to how the game works, normal and hard modes bump up the difficulty so it will give you a challenge.


The premise is that magic has been banned by the Grand  Inquisitor and the head wizard has been trapped in a lantern.  Said lantern  makes interesting wisecracks as you play ("Your sword is blowing glue!  I mean.. er... glowing blue!") and helps keep a light edge to it  all.
8288	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game is a lot of fun, but quite challenging.  The graphics are OK.  There's plenty of tension, and so excitement, during the game.  There are three difficulty levels.  Easy is too easy.  Hard is too hard.  But Normal is just right (after at least 10 games) IF you play the Kra'Hen (Klingons) until you are pretty good.  THEN you can try the Solarians (humans).  The Kra'Hen are much easier.  The Shinari don't seem to work right.  Initially, keep your taxes low for rapid population growth.  In fact, when your planet has less than 10,000 people, use NO TAX.  From 10,000 to 19,999 use low tax.  20,000 and above use moderate tax.  The reason is, your population growth depends strongly on tax, but not at all on population size.  Therefore,  you wouldn't get much tax from small population planets anyway, so make them grow fast.  Use HIGH TAX and no autobuild on all planets when you have half the galaxy or so conquered.  Also use high tax if needed to satisfy a short term demand of the God Emperor.  KEEP THE GOD EMPEROR HAPPY at all costs.  Do these things and you will have a lot of fun on moderate difficulty and even win sometimes!

Now for my reasons for the 1 star.
I first learned of these Wario Land Games by spending many months learning, on my own, through the Wario Land 4 cartridges that I bought as people traded them in at Video Game stores. When the kids were getting older and ready for more aggressive fare, I suppose.  I loved buying them and seeing how far along the original owner had - had not - gotten.  I bought  a bunch of them while they were still available as I realized that it would only be a matter of time before the newer and newer games and consoles would cause these to not only become unavailable, but possibly unappreciated for the wonderful things they are.

Overall: 9/10 - This blew me away with its creativity and amazing graphics. The ultimate original 3D platform game! If you liked this I recommend the Crash Bandicoot games and the sequels to Spyro the Dragon which are even better than this tasty candy.

And this game has a comic cmoming to life feel to it for sure! It's great cause it's a comicbook game, based on the comics, not a movie about a comicbook. Highly recommend this to anyone out there that collects old school and current game systems. Beware of Red Skull....Somehow that dude is on some Bruce Lee s***. ha ha!

The game boasts seven different main characters, all with their own backgrounds and skills. You can play the game as any one of them, while meeting the rest along the way. The problem is that all the intertwining story-lines get so crosswired that after a while you don't remember who's character you are really playing, and what your original goal was.

The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin'  question.  From the third game on, I never went without a repeat question.  You should stay away from this.  It will probably eventually drive you  insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying "Final Answer?"  anyways.  Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software.  Such  as extreme paintball, deer hunter, and other quickly thrown together  titles.  It gets a second star for being functional (barely)
DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements.
Anyway, this is it. The first "Tomb Raider" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all.

(p.s. How in the world does this game maintain a 4-star review rating average when I know for a fact that I read at least a dozen 1-star reviews?)
The CONS: Unfortunately, this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons. This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows. The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible. Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics. Here, the game gets choppy when there's a lot of action, the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of "pop up" scenery and dense fog (to cover up areas that don't have any animation.) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title "Tomb Raider". Your character controls like a robot, aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection. Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesn't respond until a full second AFTER you press it. On top of all that, the game's difficulty is pretty unforgiving. Even if you set in on "easy", the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.
1) Graphics.  With consoles now like the 360 sporting games like Halo: Reach, and the PS3 with the Uncharted series, there is some serious competition for artwork and graphics.  But the Ocarina is still more mesmerizing.  Yes, the landscape does not extend forever into the distance, and yes, the polygons making up the characters are obvious, but the lines created are more pleasing than any Zelda since, and the colors blend and contrast perfectly.  From Mount Doom to lake Hylia, the imaginary world and its inhabitants draw you in, and within a few deceptively short hours, you cannot look away. "Graphics," as thought of today, with rocks crumbling and wood splintering when bullets strike, do not exist.  But they don't need to.  Even the most obbsessed lover of graphics will forget their obsession as they get lost in this games beautiful, open world.  If you love the huge open maps of Fable 2, or the sprawling cities of Assassin's Creed, you will love this.
Here's the story of EA's "Darklight Conflict":  You are a Top Gun pilot in the middle of a dogfight when suddenly a beam of light surrounds you.  When you awake, you are in a completely foreign environment.  You realize your arms and legs have been replaced with some kind of tentacles that are biologically grafted to what appears as the console of a space vehicle.  A voice speaks in English to you, but it is not the voice of any human.  You have been inducted into the army of an alien race in the midst of interplanetary war to help defend their losing side, which is why they recruited you with your expert fighter pilot experience.  Their vessels are signified by a symbol, a four-fingered hand.  At first, you will begin with training.  The small fighterships are oval, with fins protruding from what could be their sides.  The weaponry is a variety involving weird plasma cannons.  Your ship uses an electromagnetic field to shield itself, but it consumes a great deal of energy.  You venture through the wormhole warps, and should carefully avoid the radiation waves that usurp your vessel energy during the travel.
However, enough comparisons to the horror-king series, because this game is neither better nor worse. This game is simply different. Your hero isn't a cop, and the disaster is much more philosophical and fantastic than scientific, which isn't just Resident Evil, but also Parasite Eve. This isn't as much X-Files as it is the Twighlight Zone.

5192	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	In many ways I always liked playing the original Playstation since the amount of games that were must-plays to the undiscovered gems always seemed plentiful so you never felt like you didn't buy a machine for at most, 5 or 6 games. Metal Gear Solid was quite a fun and intriguing release and it brought a more cinematic telling into the stories and although short and plotwise it can get into philosophy-speak a bit too often (though at least it's easier to swallow than Sons of Liberty), it was still one of the more unique play experiences found on the console.
Sounds: The game does have enough sound effects to convince you that it takes place in an underground dungeon.  However, the best sounds are the voice acting, which is top-knotch all the way around.  The narrator is both sinister and hilarious, and the enemy heroes are over-the-top in their arrogant, dismissive attitudes toward evil.  The music is okay, but not particularly gripping.

I first got introduced by one of my friends I mean an acquaintance. His favorite games soon showed me that he really wasn't all that bright. He said (In a gay womenly voice) "Hey try this game out." So I said hey what the hell. As I took it home I hid it away so no one would see it. So I popped it into my Playstation and even it rejected it. So after a couple of trys it finally ran. So the title screen appeared...I never knew this was an alien/vampire porno flick. The idea of impailing naked green "Slaughs" as their called in the game isn't my idea of a thrill. After killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy. Wow now I know im scared. Then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds (one retarted...another more retarted) is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sh*t. Answer me this: If a vampire/gay alien, has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk? Its amazing!! "Feed on the balls of your enemies" "Explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet!!" The main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire. His arch enemy is another vampire but is about...I don't know a billion times better then him (Just a rough estimate). The most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo. WOW THREE HITS!! Then press x to dodge/lunge and triangle to impale. Oh the complexity. My mind strains over this sh*t.

KI plays foremost like Street Fighter, with a dash of the extreme violence of Mortal Kombat. What makes it stand out is the combo system, which delivers ridiculous amounts of damage in flashy style. The whole package is delivered in Donkey Kong Country-style rendered graphics and a cd-quality soundtrack based in eurobeats (a music cd came packed in with original versions).
Note that DualShock 2 controllers will not work on original PSX hardware - but these will work on PS2 hardware (albeit without the pressure sensitive buttons).
As for the bad camera angles, they had to stay in the game.  To build in a moving camera would have destroyed the game.  I tell you now, there is something creepy about hearing the patter of zombie feet, know they are out there, and just not know where they are.

There is a reason Soul Calibur has the reputation that it doesn 12 years later. The game is simply stellar. It has aged rather gracefully and is the best game on the DC.

Some of the enemies are pure fools. I like to run around the van with them chasing. Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them. I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies. That's pretty funny too. The characters have awesome moves.

The video game industry is an industry--it exists to make money. If a publisher puts out a game that makes money but isn't strictly a videogame, they WILL do it.

Something else? I don't know.
Darkstone gives you two characters, one of which will  contribute to battles when you're controlling the other, it can be a fun  game for a younger child (who wouldn't be able to play Diablo).

Replay value? It skyrockets. There are five characters to play as, all with their own stories and objectives. The game doesn't end after each character has been completed.

It has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right.

You can only save at points that are very far apart.  The checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint  helps this a little, but being able to save a checkpoints would have made  this game much better.  Also, some scenarios are very difficult, especially  if you've been playing it through and miss one detail.  Most likely, it's a  detail that you will miss everytime, which can make a few missions very  frustrating.  The cut scenes are good and the game control is good.

If a nightmare could be captured and put into a game, this would be it. Silent Hill is about a man named, Harry Mason, who is looking for his missing young daughter in a mysterious, foggy town called, Silent Hill.

First off, the presentation is top-notch. You are treated to a couple 3D-animated FMV cutscenes. And then, BAM! As soon as the level begins, you wander at the amazingly colorful graphics, catchy lighthearted music, and as you start playing, the gameplay will get you hooked.
Aside from the annoying dialogue, and it is very annoying, the rest of the game rocks.  The way spells are cast is interesting and different from normal games where scrolls are memorized or written in a magic book.  The melee combat is good because your character has 4 different attacks instead of the one slash attack in Diablo 2.  Granted he can't learn a whirlwind attack or leap attack but who cares?  That's not realistic anyway.
Also while the backgrounds and static images or animations are incredible Westwood made a compromise and decided to reduce the resolution of the items that are more dynamic so more people with "average" systems at the time could enjoy the game. The end result is you are a very pixelated character and the characters you interact with are just as pixellated. While shading is not too bad on your pixelled self any time you compare with the backgrounds the difference is painfully obvious.

Bad
The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.

The Sonic level's, which should have been the entire game, are plagued with a broken camera (it was on crack, sometimes it would focus inside a wall) and bugs. The boss battles are way to easy, and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself (I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible). Plus the sonic story is super short. I didn't really like the other game stories.

True, they also won't win any points for originality... all though there  are a number of game play innovations that I hope the staff at Diablo II  won't ignore(upgrading weapons, skills, better mapping, running, and that  feature that autopilots you to certain places you've been before). Single  player was fun- featuring the ability to use two characters, but as with  almost games I play nowadays- multiplayer is what I care about. And with  two good friends- We had quite a blast romping through the dungeons at  Heat.net, all though its difficult to get a game going there as it hasn't  achieved a high level of popularity. What made it even better was that the  three of us were using Roger Wilco to communicate. It felt like we were in  our High school Dungeons and Dragons days even though we were in different  states.

Some of this is intentional design and some I feel maybe the fact that 3D platforming was in it's infancy at this time. Some of the angles on jumps, just seem a little off. The perspective can make it really tricky. Another problem is that the save points can be a little far between. Not the check points during the levels, they are plentiful and life saving, but the save points. Sometimes, I just wanted to finish a level I'd been on for a while, save and quit. But then I'd find that I had to go through another whole level and a half, just to get the bonus round/save point. And even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as it's set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way, you'd have to restart the level to get back to it. Again, more challenge and patience testing. My final complaint is that sometimes you'd have a nice number of lives you've accumulated from previous levels, say 20 or so, you save, come back and you only start with 4!!! I want my lives, I earned them!!! On a final note, I downloaded Crash on my PS3 but cant save as it wont, even though PS2 games do, so I have to use passwords. It's a little annoying but if they didn't provide them, then I'd really never be able to save.


6291	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	My current RPG is Planescape Torment. Black Isle studios release from a couple of years back. Developed primarly using Direct X functions, this game is similar to their other games that they have released, which take advantage of different aspects of TSR's universe.
I'll recommend this to anyone who's enjoying classic games or is a street fighter fan,,, or to anyone who likes fighting games.

Incidentally, this game is still incredibly popular in South Korea, with the top professional players earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  It is primarily due to the enthusiasm of the Koreans that this game has had its amazing longevity.  Not only has their support kept this game on the international gaming stage, but has allowed professional players to develop new and innovative strategies.  As a result, it's impossible to ever master this game.  There's always something to improve on, and better players to compete with - which are both marks of a truly great game.  Even though casual players will never directly interact with the top professional players, the pros keep the game fresh and exciting for everyone.
One of the limited exceptions to this rule has been Pac-Man. The worlds first video game character (not counting faceless space ships and tanks), he beat Mario to the sidescroller in Pac-Land, and stared in two adventure games of his own in the SNES days, Pac-Man 2 the New Adventures and Pac in Time. So when the gaming world went 3D in the late 1990's/early 2000's he was primed and ready to make the switch as well.
FInal Fantasy 7 starts off like an action movie might.  You control Cloud Strife, an ex-soldier (equivelent to the  NAvy Seals) who is now a mercenary for hire.  He is currently working for the terrorist organization known as Avalanche ran by Barrett, a big burly black man with a chaingun for a hand.  His second in command is a girl named Tifa who was a childhood friend of clouds.  After a few succesful missions cloud is seperated from the team where he meets up with a young girl named Aeris.  Little does cloud realize at first is that Aeris is beign pursued by the conglomerate Shinra (Shinra is what Avalanche is trying to bring down.).  CLoud decideds to help her out but when she is kidnapped he must rescue her.  MEanwhile a ghost from the past returns to not only haunt him, but destroy the world.

Since it came out near the end of the Super NES (at least in America, anyway), this game is very hard to find.  Nevertheless, it is WELL WORTH YOUR TIME.  The music is very good, the characters and story well developed, and the OldSkool-style battle system is very pleasing indeed.  Plus, Mario and Bowser actually fight side-by-side.

If you want to play this only for the story, you won't be impressed. If you're wondering about the gameplay, it's an action RPG very similar to Secret of Mana (and no, it's not a sequel to that game).

Final Fantasy VII has a long history behind it. FF7 was planned, first, as a new game for the SNES and was quickly moved to Nintendo's new system at the time, the Nintendo 64. Due to lack of catridge storage capacity, it eventually led to a dispute between Nintendo and Square that resulted in Square ending its long relationship with Nintendo.  Square decided, from that point, to release Final Fantasy VII for the Sony Playstation. The game has went on to sell well over 9.8 Million copies worldwide. It's spawned a series of other games under the FF7 name but none have quite reached the status that the original has. A remake has been rumored for quite some time now but, as of yet, no remake has been produced by Square. My opinion on the remake or lack thereof? Well, considering at to how they made a killing on fans buying the first game when it came out, it's almost guaranteed that they would make a killing a second time. I don't understand why they won't give the fans what they want. They'd come out alot better because of it. It would, definitely, put them back on top as the leader of RPGs..to be sure. Course, enough on the subject, right?

The great thing about the game it lets you play in two modes.  You can choose to have the battles decided in quick combat which is similar to Civilization games where you are just in charge of choosing what units to build and sending them off to battle.  You can also choose the strategic combat mode where every battle is fought on the strategic map and you take control of every unit.
1433	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Mario series from Nintendo has consistently produced games that are refreshing and innovative, not to mention extremely addictive and fun to play.  First there was the original Super Mario Brothers and Super Matio Brothers 3 for the NES, to Super Mario World for the SNES, and now Super Mario 64 for the N64.  The game is 5 years old now, but it's still just as fun to play as ever.  The graphics and sound make excellent use of the N64's capabilities to create a 3D world that was just jaw-dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today.

Yes, it's probably going to be difficult at times, however, not impossible, just challenging. Believe me, having the challenge is totally worth it.
Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways.

When playing as Marina (which is usually the case except for the two-or-so levels you play as Clancer), you "attack" your enemies by grabbing and then throwing them. You can throw them in one of eight different directions, but it's usually a good idea to act like a school bully and shake them first to relieve them of any gems they may be carrying. You can shake and throw friendly characters too if you feel like being a jerk; they don't seem to care anyway. In fact, Marina likes to throw her creator every time she rescues him, but that's probably because he looks like he's about to cop a feel when he tells her how glad he is to see her.

In this game you fly through rings, and throw a car or two, fly through more rings and more rings.  its completely accurate to the comic book series Superman: Super S***.  Next is the graphics and I must say I'm really impressed if i put on a screen next to another screen with Call Of Duty Black Ops 3 I can't tell the difference. Lastly is the game play.  the controls are so stiff and unresponsive, they're just so great just like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64.  I always find myself coming back for more and more on this game because of how good it is.  No other game can come close to being this good.  Its no doubt that this game is better than the Mario games, Body Harvest, Sin And Punishment, Diddy Kong Racing and so many more other Nintendo 64 games.  this game gets a 10 out of 10.
Some nice locales and some plain looking locales. While the lighting (outside of battle), special effects (in battle), and monsters (in battle) appear quite nice; however, the characters have few frames of animation and don't have much detail.

The story is not the greatest, but it held my intrest when I first played FF7. You never really take it seriously until one of your party members is killed 1/3 way in the game. The true enemy of this game is a cold blooded man with destruction and death left in his wake. The corporate enemy is nothing more than sidetracking cannon fodder for you to level up with. I guarentee a sense of satisfaction when finally putting the last boss away,for anything else, just for revenge would be motive enough. All charachter development is well done but a little awkward at times. Trying to make this story serious and funny at the same time, often leaves players wondering where the story is headed. For the most part, no complaints about the story. It's told with the player in mind. Trying to find a way to connect with the player.
9737	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	After recently getting Twisted Metal Head-On Extra Twisted Edition, I decided to go back and check out the older Twisted Metal games. In this case, Twisted Metal 4. While I agree with the majority that 989 Studios brought down the Twisted Metal series to some degree, it's saving grace was Twisted Metal 4. 989 Studios did try to rectify what they did wrong in Twsted Metal III by making more hidden areas than in the previous games, sharpening up the look of the game, bringing new characters to the fold(although some are downright forgettable), and improving the control of the game. It is, however, still too easy to flip over in the game--which was downright annoying in TM III or to miss a landing and whatnot. The soundtrack in the game is awesome with appearances by Rob Zombie, Cypress Hill, Cirrus and Skold. The create-a-car option is a good start but I agree with most that more variety in this area would've made a huge difference. In some respects, this game was refreshing due to its' new take on the series. It is a solid & fun game...alot more so than Twisted Metal III. Yet, still is an easily forgettable game in the series. I can only recommend this as a rental, at best.

Eclipsing Resident Evil and all other competitors in terms of scares, character development and sophistication, Silent Hill, upon its release in 1999, was unfairly ignored by the general public, even though critics were highly impressed with its blend of psychological method-scares and real-time environments. The public, used to zombie dogs bursting through windows and super-sharp pre-rendered backdrops, couldn't seem to get into a foggy real-time atmosphere where what you heard was scarier than what you saw. However, thanks in no small part to it's sequels (the standard-setting Silent Hill 2, and the graphically amazing, slightly hollow SIlent Hill 3), the original Silent Hill now enjoys something of a Classic status, and I have to say, it's very well-deserved.

This game gave all the previously a fore mentioned games a run for their money. Well done graphics, solid controls, spot on hit detection and a sharp soundtrack make this title a wonder of the PSX era. A second player option would have been nice. I have always felt that this doesn't get the hype it deserved. It was Square's finest non RPG title. Not to mix apples and oranges but I thought Einhander had a better story than Final Fantasy 7-10. I don't know what that is but the stories to the recent FF games are always a mess. I also give this title props for not resorting to lame Final Fantasy character crossovers to cover for weakspots within the title, as there are no weakspots found in Einhander.
The controls are very good.

That is why we bought Extreme G for the N64. October 1997. The end of a great summer playing Golden Eye, you knew you needed a break and heard that the fastest game ever made was coming out on the N64 and so what did you get? EXTREME G racer. Great speed in this game. Nothing like it. However I played the most recent G racer on the PS2 recently and games like this are great but have had their day. The next best game to this in terms of speed fun is SSX 3 for the PS2. I turned to MOTO GP racer simulations now instead. MOTO GP 4 is out soon.
This game is just incredible.  Please pick it up.  You won't regret it!  I've played Yoshi's Island a lot and, thanks to TONS of practice, I've become pretty good at it (I STILL can't get 100% in every level though, but that's a pretty difficult task).  I have to say the final boss battle with Bowser simply blows my mind.  I simply LOVE shooting eggs at him while having to jump around on tiny rocks.  A fantastic battle.

3447	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Let me just say that I have been a big fan of the series since the first one arrived on the playstation and this one does not disappoint. The game play is one of the most important parts in any game and this one is no exception and excels from the previous releases and adds new improvements to keep the game play from getting repetitive. The storyline is pretty good too but is mainly to expand the story of the events of resident evil 2, though there is a side story so to speak of jill trying to escape the current situation that she is in which is also a welcome edition. The graphics are some of the best seen on the playstation and the best out of any of the four resident evil game releases on the ps1, the sound is also good too. This is the first re game that never made it to the playstation greatest hits lineup, but don't let that fool you because it is still a great game and a worthy edition to the series. I have only one minor complaint though, the game is a little shorter than re2 in which I would have enjoyed the game more if it was longer, even though it is short it is also sweet. For anyone who cant understand or is confused with the storyline Ill explain: The commandos(one of many groups of rescue teams sent by umbrella) were there officially to rescue survivors, unofficially though the leader was there to keep umbrella up to date of the current situation in raccoon city and collect battle data specifically from the nemesis fighting the remaining s.t.a.r.s members. Nemesis was basically an improved version of the tyrant type 2 that was in resident evil 2 in which the first tyrant originated from resident evil 1, at this point in the game umbrella knew the current situation that was occurring in raccoon city via the leader of the commandos so the only option to cover up the incident in order to remain in business was to kill the remaining s.t.a.r.s members who held the only evidence linking this outbreak to umbrella, so they sent nemesis(an improved version of the tyrant and/or tyrant type 3) to assassinate the remaining st.a.r.s members thus destroying any evidence linking umbrella to the incident happening in raccoon city. Unbeknown to umbrella chris had already escaped before the outbreak occurred(as explained in re 2 when claire was surprised to not find chris in raccoon city, so if chris had any chance to take down umbrella he would have to not tell anyone when, where, or what he was going to do at that time). Eventually all of the main s.t.a.r.s members(barry, chris, jill) that escaped the mansion incident escaped raccoon city before it was destroyed. Eventually the remaining s.t.a.r.s members exposed umbrella putting them out of business, though people like wesker still exist to continue the work of umbrella for his own nefarious purpose. I am not really impressed with re 4 or from what I have played of re5 so far because they are just not as good as the re series used to be, this game on the other hand is a testament to the fact that you can still make vast improvements in the re series without sacrificing what made the re series so great in the first place. Sadly though I hardly recognize the re series today, it just went downhill since re4 was released because changes that were made negatively affected more than benefited the series imo. I just hope that capcom wakes up and brings the old school style resident evil flavor with improvements like re2, re3, and re:cvx did for the series in the future for the series.

For in the bowels of "Black Mesa" you'll confront howling dog things, flying crabs, alien-zombified versions of your colleagues, gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists, aliens that hang from ceilings (and entrap their victims using these vine-looking things) and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves.  If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence, I should warn you to look elsewhere - for in "Half Life", you'll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a 9mm automatic, a submachine gun, grenades and (most regrettably of all) a nasty crowbar; you'll make few friends and find yourself (for the most part) alone and (not infrequently) exiled to ventilation ducts (again with the ducts!!) to avoid getting shot at by humans, or burned, bitten, bolted or tongue-bathed by aliens.  Complex problem solving skills (as much as marksmanship or bullet-saving) are crucial in this game - in which your enemies have above-average levels of AI.  There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific mission-goal, but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them, yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve.  The settings are fantastic - from the vast to claustrophobic.  The game is long - uncommitted gamers may find it tedious - but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it.


6127	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is one of the original three pokemon games released. However, Pokemon Green version was only for the Japanese release. If you cannot read Japanese, it detracts a little from the game. However, I found that that did not bother me as much as it could have. Still an amazing Pokemon classic.

5009	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Wow... I was fourteen when I played this... 2004... sure, the PS2 was out for three years already and there were other scary games out at that time, but I was a little underprivilaged with my game systems. I had a PS1, and there were a SLEW of really good PS1 games out that I could afford. So I started my collection. I had played Syphon Filter once, so I thought I could handle everything. I went to a yard sale and saw this game sitting on a table for ten dollars. I thought, "Sure, I can handle this." The guy said, "It's really scary, are you sure?" He looked at my mother, then to me. I looked at my mother, then to the guy, and confidently said, "I can handle it. I've watched Hellraiser, Nightmare on Elm Street," ect.... I was full of my teenage self. Well, we got home and I put this in my PS1. From the very instant I removed the CD and saw, in the case, to menacing eyes glaring at me, I knew something was up. I put in the game, saw the warning, thought, "Oh, it MAY contain graphic scenes? Big deal. It's like... melted lego block graphics. I can handle it."
8147	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Gex is in a line of three games where you take control of a gecko (who is voiced by the stand up comic Dana Gould). This was also one of the first games for the original PlayStation coming three months after the release.
Well, for starters, the gameplay continues to be great, with the player once again asked to recruit the 108 stars of destiny (along with a few extra characters, particularly if there exists save data from the original Suikoden!). The battles are fun, although a bit too numerous for my liking. The townbuilding section is more involved in the sequel, and the rewards are better (including an Iron Chef-type cookoff, and well as a whack-a-mole game, a dance contest, a dice game, and other goodies). There are quite a few optional quests, multiple endings

To complete the game, you must collect all eight gym badges. Gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners. Gym owners are professional Pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience, and thus, much harder to defeat than normal Pokemon trainers. It takes a long time to collect the badges, because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game.  Between collecting badges and training Pokemon, you will encounter many RPG elements in the game, puzzles, dungeons, items, etc...  The game is huge and difficult and can take over 25 hours to complete. It certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip, which was what the GB was created for in the first place. Taking into account that the GB is a very primitive console, the kind of experience Pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming. It's an edifying experience.
Finally, to the card game: this is by far the deepest "minigame" in any RPG to date, and like it's been said before, it is better than some separate games. There's a slew of cards of various kinds, especially because you can turn any of the numerous monsters into a card with a special command. There are rare cards to be found. As you travel, you will wander into locales with different rules. It can seem overwhelming at first, and it probably is.

There are 3 different factions to play as: The Mercs, The Sea Reapers and the Giant Kabuto himself. With the Mercs, there are 5 guys, though you basically play as one of them with the other four tagging along and mimicking you -- there strength is in weapons and technology. The Sea Reaper is Delphi, a sort of mermaid like women with very strong magical powers. And Kabuto, who is raw strength and size.
