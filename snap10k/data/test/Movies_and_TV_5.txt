If you haven't seen this movie yet you should pick it up so you can see it! It's really a cool way to look back at the punk scene of the 1980s, and also just the makers of the film did a great job encapsulating the way any music scene operates in it's inner circle. Matthew Lillard puts on a great  performance!

6642	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I never played the video game but I still enjoyed this feature.  If you are averse to heavy doses of blood (dogs with skin gone - you get the picture), this is not for you.  I enjoyed the story and it was quite a thrill ride.  In this day and age of corporate greed and coruption, the story fit in nicely.  We don't want those corporations getting out of control, do we?  Last warning - like Blade and Blade II - lots of gore.
This 'special edition' was not worth it if you look at it from the point of view of the extra scene - it truly is throw-away. However, the extras range from interesting (how the castle was used in various and sundry scenes) to funny (how to get your own coconuts and run like a silly person around the castle grounds).

The strength of Oliver Stone's screenplay and Alan Parker's direction is in its portrayal of Billy Hayes' slow, steady descent into real madness; it's that old saw about how, if you treat a man like an animal, he'll turn into one. When Hayes makes the switch, Alan Parker is ready with a full arsenal of stylistic tricks: slow-motion photography, scary music, abstract sound, and plenty of blood and gore. But it's a slippery slope to get him there; the primary difficulty with telling this particular story is that you're asking an audience to sympathize and identify with a protagonist who is, semantics and connotations aside, a drug smuggler. And at the time he commits that crime that is literally all we know about him, Alan Parker and Oliver Stone parachute into the action at the last possible moment, beginning the film with Billy Hayes strapping the hash to his body and heading to the airport. There's no denying how unnerving the customs sequence is to watch; it's scored with heartbeat percussion and builds up some genuine tension, in spite of the fact that we know he's not going to get away with it, if he did, there'd be no film. But that speaks to the skill of Alan Parker's filmmaking; since we know nothing about this guy, we've got no good reason to want him to get away with it. In the scenes that follow, Oliver Stone's best notion for getting us on the protagonist's side seems to be making Billy Hayes into a dumb, nave kid, and letting us see how he is ruined by this corrupt, foreign, evil system (never mind that the good ol' U.S.A is not exactly renowned for the common sense proportionality of our drug sentencing).

Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. "Where did Santa's suit come from?", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed.

After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.

What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue.  This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains.  The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material.  While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands.  Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.  This treasure of a film should be included in every collection.

Scorcese does a fine job here. The isolation that is projected by the limited interaction of Bickles life and the "confined to a cab" metaphor work to show what insanity may be like. The street scenes and characters are first rate. Even in a city that was worse after crack cocaine hit the streets, Scorcese shows the decay that was so prevalent in the 70's and 80's. Also worth thought is a comparison to a later event of the "Subway Vigilante" Bernard Goetz and whether his acts were a similar cry for help or a legitimate defense of self and property.

"This is Going to slow us down."
In that sense "Easy Rider" is a very, very different road trip from that of the literary one in Jack Kerouac's 1957 "On The Road" (although the "action" of that book actually took place in the late 1940s). That small generational difference in time probably in cultural time was a matter of different epochs. The action of "On The Road" speaks to an almost subterranean escape from the bleakness of American conformity in the immediate post-World War II period behind the backs of the squares. The bikers, Fonda and Hopper (Wyatt and Billy, alright), in "Easy Rider" are up front and public, as reflected the change in mores of their times, about their "making and doing" as they confronted their version of American conformity in the 1960s. In the end they lost that public battle, and we have been fighting a rearguard series of "culture wars" battles ever since. But watch this film to get a slice of 1960s Americana. And if you are too young to know some of the references just ask mother and father (or the grandparents, ouch!). They WILL know.

  It's become obvious down through the years that, as cartoons list  their stylish subtlety and went increasingly towards a specific aim at the  juvenile crowd, that Jim Henson and his band of merry monsters would take  up the slack that the golden age of Warner Brothers and Looney Toons had  left-- material that was aimed at kids, but with enough adult-oriented  material to keep the adults watching, as well. (Go back and watch those old  cartoons. You'll be amazed at what passed you over when you were a tot that  you find hilarious now, such as Porky Pig's many jabs at Hitler.) Henson's  bunch created two of television's finest, and most underrated, variety  shows, The Muppet Show and Muppets Tonight, both of which played the  balance between kid-oriented slapstick and more adult humor that could have  come straight from the joke book of Don Rickles. And when they started  making movies, they opted for the same approach, and when parents went to  see The Muppet Movie with the little ones, they ended up laughing just as  much.

3115	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Despite having aged in the last 30+ years, "Easy Rider" remains one of the most important and influential films ever made. Written by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda (with Terry Southern) and directed by Hopper; Easy Rider is a film that introduced the world to a rising young star named Jack Nicholson, a film that is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#88), and is a brilliant look at the drug/hippie culture of the 60's. Fonda and Hopper play Wyatt & Billy, two men who experience freedom by riding their motorcycles around. The movie has such a lack of plot; I'm not even entirely sure how to sum it up. Even more amazing is how detailed and elaborate this film actually is. Carrying cocaine in one of the gas tanks, they ride around while encountering various eccentric characters. They also encounter ignorance, bigotry, and, eventually, George Hanson (Nicholson), a drunken lawyer who joins the boys on their ride. Nicholson got an Oscar nomination for his role and receives star billing, but isn't actually in the movie very long. He definitely steals the show, though. The movie, for me, evoked memories of a film called "Midnight Cowboy." It too had star-making performances (by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight), took a look at the hippie/Andy Warhol-drug culture, and has a similar grainy look and feel to it. While I think Midnight Cowboy is a better film, Easy Rider is a more important one. Almost anyone who watches it will agree that time hasn't been very kind to the movie, yet people still watch this movie to this day. It's #88 on The American Film Institute's List, but if that list was in order of watched most frequently it would place in the top 10 (probably below or next to Pulp Fiction, Casablanca, The Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, etc.). One of the best (and most haunting) moments comes in the end. That inevitable moment would be changed in today's Hollywood in favor for a happy ending. This is the only ending that could've worked for a movie about guys like these. This is an unforgettable motion picture experience.
Nemesis creature
For my money this makes Easy Rider ahead, rather than behind its times. It's also rooted in a number of great cinematic traditions, aside from the Road Movie genre which it helped to invent. I like the idea (expressed in a review below) that this is a latter day western, even down to the character's names, Wyatt and Billy. Also, were you to draw a line between Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid and Thelma & Louise, it would intersect Easy Rider.
Overall, the movie is a story about how the human soul and spirit cannot be quantified into the code of DNA and how we as humanity are more.  Its definitely a deep movie but if you've ever felt put down by others or that you don't belong somewhere, watch this movie and it will quickly change your mind.
Thank You .
Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)

6912	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Having long been familiar with both theatrical and soundtrack recordings of "Pal Joey" I felt I was past due to view the movie. First and foremost pointing out that the film is dated would be a totally unwarranted and unjustified point. This film holds up well even after 50+ years. Some feel that Gene Kelly should have reprised his Broadway role in the movie but had Sinatra not been the force that he was it is highly likely that the movie itself would have never been made. Production values are maybe a bit below what I would have expected for a feature musical of the period but certainly there is nothing here to complain about. Sinatra is in fine voice with maybe the definative reading of "Lady is a Tramp", Hayworth for me was perfect, at least until the dream sequence just prior to the end of the film and Novak might have slighly unplayed her role but was quite beautiful and an excellent choice for the role. What others have failed to point out is that neither Hayworth nor Novak did their own singing. Jo Anne Greer was the wonderful singer of "ZIP" & "Bewitched" both credited to Hayworth's character while Judy Erwin handled Novak's vocals including "My Funny Valentine". (Trivia note: Rita Hayworth's "Put the Blame on Mame" from the movie "Glida" was actually song by Anita Ellis.) My only real complaint with the film was the dream sequence near the film's end. This sequence looks cheap in technique and quite honestly doesn't advance the story as I think was intended. All in all it's a very pleasant couple of hours with music most interested in this title will remember and a true star turn for all three of the headliners.

Driving a cab is like a drug: you get to meet new people everyday; you don't have to wait a week or two to get paid---everything's cash money; you get to know the whole city; you learn where the hot spots are--the restaurants, the bars, the clubs, etc. You set your own hours and you choose where you want to work and whom you want to serve. You have no one breathing down your neck--you are your own boss. There's a saying among cabbies: only two kinds of people get more p**** than cabbies: movie stars and rock stars.

4302	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	It's been 20 plus years since I've wateched this movie.  This movie has so many Hollywood insider references that I must confess I will never be able to appreciate them all.  I'll watch the reviews for those who can pin them all and I thank you.  The most tragic and poinent cameo is Ms. Maria Shriver's role.  Thank you for your governess, and much enjoyed movies, but I am sorry about your mistake...

6626	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	In my opinion I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Watching it 3 times praticly in a row before having to return it to the rental store. But be warned. It doesnt really relate very much to the Game at all really. With the whole buisness people building that live underground an such....dont remember that part in the game O.O...but it DOES give good scenes as well with the ''zombies'' and the all famous ''Licker''. Like I said I DID enjoy it...but if your expecting something to be almost JUST like the game series...you might want to rent it first,just so to be sure that you'll enjoy it before you buy it.
Some of the performances are more successful than others, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, and Darryl Hannah coming out on top (I am greatly surprised that so many other reviewers dislike Hannah's performance, which seems to me considerably less artificial than many others--but perhaps since I'm actually Southern I have a different perspective); Sally Fields and Dolly Parton are less successful, but not in any sense that actually distracts from the fun.  Perhaps most surprising in a film which focuses on women are the brief but impressive performances from the male supporting cast, which includes effective performances by Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepherd, and Dylan McDermott, and which serve to ground the film with a sense of the broader community in which the women live.

6463	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I loved the book, I loved the film. I think Streisand beautifully captured the essence of the book's emotional intensity. For me,the scenery in the film was exactly as I'd imagined it based on Pat Conroy's descriptions. HOWEVER, having waited eagerly for the DVD, was very disappointed to find no special features of note (unless you call trailers and filmographies 'special features'). I know I've seen a 'Making of...' somewhere before and assumed that it would be included in this addition. As thrilled as I am to own this movie on DVD, don't buy this thinking there are extras. You'll be disappointed.

Close Encounters Of The Third Kind is the journey of Roy Neary. Roy Neary is a dreamer, stuck in the mundane craziness of everyday life. One night Roy sees something that changes his life, he has a Close Encounter with something unexplainable.
"Taxi Driver," is a mixture of Urban Gothic horror and a psychological case study of the terror that can be wrought by loneliness and alientation, scored beautifully by the late Bernard Herrmann (can anyone watch the film without going around humming that haunting saxophone passage?)

As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.

Call me spoiled, but l saw and greatly prefer the Broadway version which respected a more sophisticated audience and which gave us several "inside" and tongue-in-cheek jokes. The movie rams everything down the viewer's throat. And the ending was worthy of Ziegfeld...who's been dead for awhile.
"ROXANNE" is an entertaining romantic comedy with Steve Martin in the top of his game.
9066	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	What else can you say about Monty Python?  This is just one of his movies that deal with utter  nonsense but it is probably the funniest.  There's no real plot, but a lot of sight gags and slapstick.  Geared more for adult audiences because of it's inane humor, but good for a real fun time.
I might be completely biased with this movie, because much like my unholy memories with Tom Green, the Spice Girls were also a devistating memory of youth; the thing is I used to like Tom Green while I was strongly indifferent with the girl band.  But for most of my middle school years, I'm surround by many fangirls in support of this group who play their music loudly and constantly, and I had to be the butt of a ongoing ridicule just because I made a simple comment that Ginger Spice was cute (and Geri Haliwell still looks pretty good).  My adolescent years was damaged because of the band, so reopening this mental wound does lead to personal spite.
Seedy does not begin to describe the horror of "Taxi Driver," which details a world of pimps, prostitutes, drug addicts and a loner psycho brilliantly portrayed by Robert De Niro. This film established some of the great talents in motion picture history including De Niro, Scorsese, Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster. I wonder about disturbing epics like "Taxi Driver," "A Clockwork Orange," "Straw Dogs" and "Natural Born Killers." Whenever I visit the video store, I notice these films are usually checked out, empty boxes leaning against the shelf. Who's watching these films, and why so often? The films share a common thread in that they have likable actors (De Niro, Malcolm McDowell, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Harrelson) playing despicable men prone to violent rages. Alienated one and all, these characters have become anti-heroes for a world severely lacking in heroes. There are so many ways to view this film, with multiple levels serving as proof to its complicated brilliance. Urban alienation, cultural emptiness, veiled racism, Watergate analogy and Oswald repression are just a few of the metaphorical doors one can open in this nightmare.

1695	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is a very solid video series for WWII.  In three episodes it chronicles the war as a whole.  As a teacher there are many chapters that can be selectively used in the classroom on a variety of WWII topics and themes.  Since it is in color, it is also more appealing to the students.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in WWII and to history teachers as a classroom resource.
2071	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Great action flic. A bit dated but not so much that you would notice. Acting is good considering the type of movies. Yea, some of it is a bit far fetched but hey...........its a movies. Enjoy!!!
5157	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	There's no point in gushing because as you can see there's more than enough to convince you to buy this classic. It aims at two audiences, crime noir fans and the Travis Bickle-ites, and for a time I felt very much like 'ol Travis myself. Love, acceptance, sanity, these were things that were alien to his mind, and when you live in a world, no, a city, where you're a thread away from becoming another faceless drone in the sea of insanity around you, it is a truly depressing thought because it's not a question of 'if' but rather a question of 'when'. The moment Travis Bickle topples the television set over with his foot, his downward spiral truly begins in horrific fashion.

The basic theme of the story is the maturation of two brothers, and their relationship with their stern, Presbyterian minister father.  One brother is level-headed, destined for a life of teaching and achievement.  The other brother, equally precocious, is seduced by his love of gambling and drinking to the point where his life becomes corrupt.  As his father says, sometimes those who need our help do not want it, and indeed do not wish to be helped.  The common bond between the brothers and their father is fly fishing in the great trout rivers of Montana, and this makes for a wonderful backdrop to a very interesting storyline.  The interaction between these protagonists is a fascinating interplay of personalities, and (although you may not know it from this review) the storyline of this film moves along briskly, and keeps the viewer's interest.
3675	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Idle Hands is a fun movie from 1999, it does have a very that era look to it, as well as a soundtrack full of 90's bands like The Living End and The Offspring.  The Offspring actually are in the film as a high school dance band, they play a cover of a Ramone's song I Wanna Be Sedated, and a few of their lesser big hit songs that non fans of theirs probably haven't heard before like Beheaded. But you don't have to have been a teen in the 90's to enjoy this teen aimed horror comedy.  And comedy is what it is, this isn't a movie taking itself seriously or trying to scare you or freak you out.  It's a stoner slacker 90's movie with the horror element of a hand of the town's laziest pothead (Devon Sawa) becoming possessed and becoming a serial killer, starting with the teen's own mum and dag (Fred Wilard, Frank Dunphy in Modern Family) only he's so out of it he doesn't catch on they're dead for a while.  When he does he tries rather unsuccessfully to stop it doing what it wants to do which includes killing his stoner friends (Seth Green and Elden Henson).  But his stoner friends are too lazy to walk up the stairs into the light so their corpses come back with the injuries they sustained.  He's also trying to stop his hand from killing the girl (Jessica Alba) in the house across the street who he's always had a crush on but has been to shy to talk to.

"AIR FORCE ONE" features a commentary track by Director Wolfgang Petersen and Michael Coleman.  This is the same commentary from the DVD release but there is good information from Petersen on scenes that were actual aerial shots and not CG and which parts were shot on a set and were CG'd.  Also, learning about his feelings towards his cast members, Harrison Ford especially and how Ford did his own stunt work.
3812	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Spielberg's vision of the outerworld is brilliant and captavating. The film is long, but it demands attention. Stephen wrote this and directed it. Dreyfuss is good, but a little to strong in his character. Melinda Dillon as the single mother who loses her son to the aliens is brilliant, so is Teri Garr. This film makes you think, can the government actually pull this off?...After seeing this, I believe it. The DTS version is incredible, the scene where Barry,(little boy), is abducted, is just out right crazy and loud.

5572	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	It's safe to say that Charley Brewster has a short attention span. In fact, that's probably an understatement. But, when Charley oversees his new neighbor committing murder through his bedroom window, he finally gets some focus in his life. Much to the dismay of his family and friends, however, his new focus is on vampires. After a violent confrontation with Jerry, the creature next door, Charley is desperate to destroy the monster, and he attempts to enlist the aid of local "Fright Night" horror host Peter Vincent, the fearless vampire killer, to do it. Unbelieving Peter is reluctant, but Charley's girlfriend Amy and creepy-geek friend, Evil Ed, convince him with a bit of financial persuading. Their intention is to prove to Charley that Jerry Dandrige is not a vampire at all, but they are in for the scare of their lives, and it's anybody's guess who will survive the real "Fright Night!"
Just wanted to add that I got the Special Edition. It's Awesome! The Lego scene and the Japanese version is funny. What they did was translated from English to Japanese, dubbed it into Japanese and translated back into English. Though all the tranlataions the script changes.

2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] "believable" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.
As anyone who has read the book can attest, the characters of Tom and Lila Wingo would seem to be extremely challenging (if not almost unplayable) roles, both of which are brimming with contradictions and hidden emotions. However, Nick Nolte and Kate Neligan find the perfect balance in their portrayals, which earned them both well-dissevered Oscar nominations. Blythe Danner, Jason Gould, and Melinda Dillion all also turn in memorable performances, even though Dillion's Savannah (a lead character in the novel) has precious little screentime due to the film's structure. Barbra also gives an affecting portrayal, however, the director's chair is where she really shines this time. With it's moving storyline, compelling characters, and breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, THE PRINCE OF TIDES is film that will continue enchant audiences for years to come.

Attempts at normacly fail. Bickle, as many crazed people, seems to have honest perceptions and a nothing-to-lose attitude which impresses Cybill Shepard (a political campaign worker) enough to accompany him on a date. Bickel proves to be socially inept however and scares her away, further plunging him into first despair, then a desperate regiment of push-ups, calisthenics and target practice. Eventually, with no ideology or clear motive, Bickel makes a failed attempt at shooting Jack Pallandine, the Presidential candidate his romantic interest works for.

3162	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This movie is a strong one that pulls on your heart strings. You'll laugh a lot, cry a little, and love it all the more. While the ending might be sad it also leaves on a cheerful note (oh, you'll see). Really this is a movie meant for a girl's night in with bons bons and wine.
5405	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Not far from the truth. Sombody's true life story? (maybe) That's pretty much how the years went in the scene.
Why not 5 stars?  There's some ridiculous editing in this film.  A lot of it is in the climactic shoot out.  Matthew, the scumbag pimp, takes a a bullet in the gut and returns several minutes later as fresh as a daisy wielding a .44 magnum and firing at De Niro.  There are some strange continuity issues as De Niro climbs the stairs surrounded by his rivals.  You kind of have to see it to understand.
The usually lasers and explosions are not present.
Now, to the movie.  This movie is excellent.  This movie has more dogs, lickers, zombies, and the inclusion of the Nemesis, considered to be the best Resident Evil monster.  I think those honors go to the lickers, my favorite.  This film doesn't add anything new or innovative to the zombie world, but what film in the past ten years has?  Zombies are flat creatures.  The reason Resident Evil is so cool is that there are more than just zombies included.  Sharks, lickers, hunters, dogs, and tyrants!  This movie is worth the price I payed when it first came out.  I was totally captivated by the action.  The film jumped me at times, and I was totally creeped out in the school scene.  Mike Epps is definitely worth the price of this DVD.  He doesn't try to be a serious character, completely revamping his career, but he sticks to his normal self, LAUGHS, LAUGHS, LAUGHS!  I'll admit that I laughed at EVERY one of his lines.  Just because it isn't the scariet film ever doesn't mean that you shouldn't view it, ignore the bad, horrible reviews and see it.  You owe it to yourself.  Give the filmmakers a chance to make a third.  Other great zombie movies are 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead (2004), Shaun of the Dead, Resident Evil, Romero's holy trilogy, and anything by Lucio Fulci involving zombies.

651	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Wow, this Christmas classic answers all of the little ones' inevitable questions about the origin of Santa, the use of stockings, the use of a chimney, how reindeer fly, etc. In the middle of the main story is a villain, the Warlock, who is transformed from an evil figure to a good one as a result of Santa giving him a toy. Meanwhile, the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys, much to the chagrin of Jessica, who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always, the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case, it's good defeating evil, goodwill and love over hate and persecution. The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, who does a fine job. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town stands as one of the true classics, and belongs in everyone's animated Chrustmas collection.
840	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I first saw this film back in 1983. I must have been about seven. I remember when it first premiered on PBS (Channel 11 in Chicago, where I grew up). My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.
Thankfully the cgi is done in a very artistic way. It's used to make jaws on zombies look transparent where there are holes etc. Overall, it's a great movie to go see if you're sick of the past few years of horror movies and are wanting to see the best of what horror has to offer, new and old.

As for Travis Bickle, he's nuts.  You want to root for him, but you can only do that to a point because he is nuts.  He is extremely well played by DeNiro.
Too complex to memorize, but any machine can memorize even more complex things and recognize them. But here we have several couples of interest and rivalry. A child born naturally and whose fate is doomed to be deemed bad and it is supposed to be bad, and life expectancy is as low as some odd 30 years. On the other side his brother was genetically correct and perfect.

2905	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Too bad Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper never released their 3 1/2 hour original cut of Easy Rider. I guess what nowadays would be called the "Director's Cut", or the "Extended Edition". Peter Fonda showed this cut to his father, Henry, who liked it, and talked of releasing it after the theatrical version had played out. Back then, that would have meant a theatrical release, in the days before VHS cassettes and DVD's. On the music: CSN&Y's "Find The Cost of Freedom", performed acappella on their live album "Four Way Street" was originally written by Stephen Stills for the ending of the movie, but Fonda/Hopper instead used "Flow River Flow", written by Roger (nee Jim) McGuinn, and performed by the latest incarnation of The Byrds at the time (1969).

I found this film to be delightful. It's about two agents living in London, England, who are on a mission to stop a well-to-do knight from controlling the weather. By controlling the weather with his large weather-making machine, Sir Sean Connery, incidentally a knight himself in real-life, wants to rule the world, but not if Steed and Mrs. Peel have their say in it!

Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. "Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!".
It's fun to hear the "alien theme" music again, and Richard Dreyfuss is very good. But Francois Truffaut?? Why did Speilberg cast him?  He's usually so assured with his ununsual casting choices (Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams?  Great idea!  Roy Scheider in Jaws?  Oprah Winfrey in Color Purple?  He's so often gone with unknowns or unusual choices and we've usually been SO pleasantly surprised).
why waste your time and my money on releasing a new DVD that is no better than the old version?
I cannot guess why films like this get made???? All that money wasted on a piece of junk. The CGI throughout is quite weak, especially the 'crash' at the end which pays no heed to what a plane would actually do when hitting the water, which WOULD have been far more dramatic a conclusion, if they just paid attention to physics. It was actually hilarious.

The beauty of the film lies not in the complications or originality of the plot--but in the course of the character development. The boys are not really criminals but people pretending to enjoy what they believe are the non-material rewards of crime--a kind of life-informing cool. Which is to say, I suppose, that they are mere teenagers looking for the kind of social selves and knowing attitudes that can only really come from having lived a little longer than 18 or 19 years and at some other business than being a teenager. What's more, they have chosen a career requiring a soulessness and absence of empathy that belies their own thoroughly good-natured polity.

The movie was great and exciting but I think the dvd is a little outdated when compared to other dvd's these days as it does not have any special bonus features. The only thing good about it is the commentary from director Wolfgang Peterson who provides several insights on the making of the movie in the commentary. I think that it is time the studio release a special edition 2 disc dvd set of the movie. I would definitely love to see a behind the scenes look at the movie. Such as how they did the accurate looking set for the plane etc.. Maybe some deleted scenes if there were any. Common Sony pictures! Bring out the special edition already!!!!

1704	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Based on reviews I'd read beforehand, I expected something big with this 2-disc set.  To its credit, it runs 2 hours and 51 minutes.  But it's on the pricey side and a lot of what's shown here has been on other more recent (and less expensive) DVD's, like "Hitler, in Color," which is really outstanding.  I also expected this DVD set to be better than "World War II in Color, the British Story."  On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary.  The "British Story" is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.
Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.



This set includes the episodes from each series as well as the two-hour telefilm, 'Rumpole's Return', a re-introduction to Rumpole after the early run of shows which ended with Rumpole nearing retirement. The disc with 'Rumpole's Return' includes several other bonus features, including a brief biography of John Mortimer, a brief history of the Old Bailey, and a list of executioners of the Old Bailey neighbouring Newgate Prison, the last of whom performed his final duty in 1902.

Besides, their DVD running time is approximately 40 minutes. My 12-month-old niece is into cartoon in the first place. My sister-in-law's mistake. Cartoon offers her entertainment. And my wife told her younger sister that Sesame Street DVD can be a good tool for babies/kids to learn & promised her it'll be a birthday gift for her daughter. Sadly, we can't find any Sesame Street DVD in Malaysia & if there is any, the price will be around RM 80 (USD 20.00). That's when I logged on to Amazon.com & purchased it. Now she has gradually developed big interest in watching the DVD. The only dissatisfaction I have is that the captioning doesn't appear (only the subtitle appears). The captioning is good for impaired-hearing people & kids to learn about reference to situation (eg. "chattering", "laughing"). I've bought few DVDs from Amazon before (eg. American Me) & the captioning appears as just fine on my region-all DVD player. Regards, Irwan Shah from Malaysia.

I just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it.
But overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.
Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively. The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.
Finally, kudos to Anderson's team for mixing up effective CGI with animatronics: in the last few years, horror directors have taken the easy road with cheap computer-generated effects, and happily Anderson opts for tastily gory animatronic models that give beasties like the "Licker" the respect they deserve.

 This is an extraordinary compilation of the Edwardian period of English history.  The escapades of over 27 years of English history is indeed grand.  Upstairs resides the family Bellamy with all their aristocratic problems.  Below, downstairs resides the people of service led by the steadfast Angus Hudson who resided as the Butler.  The complete series covers the intrigues from 1903 to 1930.  We see Edwardian England, World War I and the roaring 20's.
Overall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode "Alberto" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an "R" rating. Other than that, it's mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.

Brilliant comedian/filmmaker Albert Brooks has an amusingly neurotic role as one of Shepherd's colleagues.  The always excellent Peter Boyle also stars.
Originally released in 1997, Ford plays President James Marshall, a Vietnam vet turned president who makes it clear in a stunning speech at a Moscow dinner that America will now pursue a "zero tolerance" policy on international terrorism (sound familiar?). Boarding Air Force One for the return flight home from Moscow, Marshall is joined by his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and his daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). He's also joined by a contingent of Eastern European journalists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman).

The two most pivotal points in the movie: when Travis finally meets an attractive woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and asks her out on a date, but screws it up badly... although Travis meant well (he honestly didn't know any better), Betsy decides to just ignore him. This is a situation almost all of us have been in, whether or not we took someone to a movie like that, and that only helps us sympathize with Travis.

Not too many dull moments. I compare this to the Lost Boys which came out  in 87. One of the top 5 vampire movies of all time (Lost boys is still #1 with me).
The plot is unique and well done. Very good action and drama.
Worst:
I am really getting annoyed with the bad reviews this movie is getting though. Some of the reviewers trash the movie always referring to the Alice in Wonderland theme and Anderson's past film credits (Mortal Kombat). Now tell me honestly...how many times was Alice's (Milla) name even mentioned? How many times was the mansion referred to as Looking Glass House? Not many. So why complain about that tid bit? And as far as original...what HAS been original in horror films lately? Most everything in one fashion or another has been done or copied. So just enjoy the ride. Sit back and let it take you because it DOES.

3. Vincent's parents had a valid son after him - believable enough.  But this brother shows back up in the story in a clumsy and contrived manner.  This brother story-line adds nothing to the plot and it interrupted my suspension of disbelief.
Originally filmed in 1975, the movie has become a cult-classic, and a favorite for many generations of Monty Python enthusiasts.  Considered by many to be their most successful feature film, the Holy Grail relies on a careful combination of slapstick humor combined with clever writing and high-brow British wit.  Though some of the humor relates to the period the film was shot, most of it transcends any generation, poking fun at history with an originality and absurdity that is funny and entertaining.

Martin is the fire chief of a scenic Northwest resort town. There are two newcomers to town: a professional firefighter (Rick Rossovich) and a beautiful female astronomer (Daryl Hannah). Martin, the self-assured, passionate but ugly (that schnoz) chief and Rossovich, the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for Hannah; of course Hannah is interested in the hunk. But Rossovich is unable to talk to bright women, so Martin feeds him lines and Hannah is swept off her feet. The mistaken identity is all worked out satisfactorily by picture's end (Martin wins Hannah). Everything works perfectly in this movie, and Martin is at his very best. I've watched this quite a few times over the years and the humor never gets stale. A terrific movie.

The standard DVD version of GATTACA from Columbia/Tristar offers a very good digital transfer of the film (there are a few filmic artifacts) in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  It also has bonus material that includes a short featurette, trailers, and some deleted scenes.  The SuperBit DVD version--also in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen--offers a crisper, less grainy digital transfer, but it was apparently made from the same source and therefore contains the same filmic artifacts.  (Audiophiles note: the SuperBit does have superior sound.)  Keep in mind that, as with other SuperBit offerings from Columbia/Tristar, the increased bit rate comes at the cost of bonus material--you get the film only.  And the higher cost of the SuperBit is justifiable only if you have a high-definition TV and can therefore appreciate the extra visual info.  Regardless of which DVD version is purchased, however, a GATTACA DVD is a must-own for any true fan of intelligent speculative science fiction.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains a cult favorite amongst geeky young males who play Magic in comic book shops. Many of these men grow up to be comic writers or shrubbery salesmen.

Everything is well thought out and executed in true Python style. From the coconuts and the swallows to the witch burnings and killer bunny, this movie has it all: absurdity, humour, erm...tragedy? Ok not that really, but anyway. The storyline is simplistic but of course there are massive deviations from the actual story thanks to the British Police and various French K-nighits that constantly impede King Arthur's noble quest to find the Holy Grail. The whole Python group deliver a dynamite performance filled with fall-over-laughing skits and absurd situations, whether it's the difficulty of building a castle in a swamp or using a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the French Fortress.

President Marshall leaves a gorgeous and enormous looking Moscow dinner hall after delivering a very brief subdued and yet powerful speech concerning terrorism and foreign policy. Upon boarding the plane we are introduced with Ivan Korshunov who is played by the versatile and ever so impressive (Gary Oldman) While Air Force One is in flight, the audience discovers a mole in the secret service that is able to board Ivan and his other supportive terrorists companions. The secret service wastes no time in starting the bloodshed as he fires two bullets into two cabinet member's heads while they were discussing and briefing on important foreign policy matters. Soon the trails of a smoke grenade released by the secret service man signal Ivan and his ultra radical friends to unleash hell on the president and everyone else on the plane; and, that is exactly what they do because they are incredibly vengeful, bitter and quite keen on releasing General Radek.

I've always liked their absurd attacks on every institution in the world, and their staggering creativity and originality.  Their TV show is still my favorite thing they've done, but Grail has more than enough to make it classic.  I love the filmmaking of this film--Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam are working on a pitiful budget, on location, and for the most part this looks great.  Imagine if people in the middle ages had cameras and decided to make a documentary--it might look a lot like this.  These directors are clearly knowledgeable about artistic films from directors such as Ingmar Bergman, and their knowledge gives the movie a texture and tone you just don't find in comedies.  But this isn't just any comedy.  If you're looking for something light and fluffy, you won't find it here.  Even the rabbit is a vicious killer!  Take the scene early in the film with the guy collecting dead bodies in a plague village for a fee.  The animal and human dung, the groans of terminal illness, a cat being beaten to death against a wall, then a man being beaten to death for "nine pence"--you get the idea.  But nevertheless the scene is funny.  If you like that scene you'll like the rest of the film.  Still, it is a mighty angry movie.  It condemns the violence behind legends like King Arthur (a towering performance from Graham Chapman, absolutely convincing, one of the finest straight men--even though in real life he was gay--in a movie comedy), organized religion, and western philosophy.  One more thing--the characters who make me laugh the most are Tim the Enchanter, Roger the Shrubber, and the Old Man on The Bridge of Death.  (Terry Gilliam's presence as actor and director and animator on the movie is a marvel--a great way to see how his career as a great director started.)  Like all Python films it has peaks and valleys; some scenes last too long, some are based on a thin concept, some push it as far as mixing the gruesome and the madcap, like the Tale of Sir Lancelot where John Cleese as Lancelot slaughters or otherwise brutalizes a bunch of women, children, and old men at a wedding, rather bloodily--too much here, I think.

Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!

The government researcher scenes tend to be chaotic and confusing.  It's not unusual to have to sit through a few minutes of incomprehensible material before you can finally understand what's going on at the very end of the scene.  They also didn't add a whole lot to the film, especially given the amount of time they take up.  The plot line involving Roy Neary is the most interesting.  After his encounter, he's driven by strange compulsions but he doesn't understand what they mean or how to deal with them.  His family gets pretty freaked out, especially his wife (Teri Garr).

The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.

There's the scene where he must suffer brutal surgery in order to be the right height. And of course, throughout the movie, the constant tension of always having to be perfect, perfect, perfect--not even an eyelash out of place.

This movie has  provided countless hours of entertainment, and probably the most one-liners  of any feature film ever released.  That it is coming out on DVD with *9*  deleted scenes (Marshall and Jackson together at last?  Weeza hookin' up  with Owen Jenkins and his Mercedes Benz?) is the best news I've had all  day!

It may seem a little dated, being made in 1984, but the special effects still hold up pretty well. The acting's good, the storyline's good, and there are some good scares to be had. What more could you want from a horror movie?
Can you see Bill Clinton or George Bush beating up terrorists like Harrison Ford did? Maybe he should be our president, lol.
But all one has to do is yank the string and this whole faade could unravel before Vincent's very eyes.

Scorsese works magic in this film. A number of scenes from this film are unforgettable and some have become iconic. Obviously the "Are you talking to me..." mirror scene is the most well known but there are a number of others. Travis winds up a Secret Service agent, suggesting he would like to join. This is marvellously played, and you will notice that Travis has made some slight adjustments to his hair. Another classic scene, which certainly influenced Quentin Tarantino for a scene in 'Reservoir Dogs', is where Travis goes to buy some guns. The dialog is marvellous. Full credit to Paul Schrader for the brilliant script, without his contribution the film would not have as good.

A single mother named Jillian (Melinda Clarke) who's son was abducted by a UFO also helps with Roy and other ones that have encountered the strange Unidentified Flying Object especially French researcher Claude Lacombe (Francois Trauffaut) has a believe that music can be a language of the strange beings. The witnesses including the government and researchers head to Devil's Peak in Wyoming to make a special meeting place to meet the alien beings.

It wasn't until the Special Edition came out in theatres where I finally got to see it with all the added scenes. Yet, after watching this DVD version I love it! The movie most definitely does better without all the added stuff. The sound and picture are better than it ever was in theatres but that's also a testament to explain how far the technology of sound has come from. Let's face it, I saw the Special Edition in theatres in 82! Sound has most definitely improved since then, thank God! The picture quality is unbelievable and after watching "Superman The Movie" it's great to see our classic films get the facelift they deserve, even though most of these actors need facelifts of their own:) Just kidding!

This is an absolutely wonderful movie and DVD.  It is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio, although this edition was not the one originally in theatres.  On top of that, it is a wonderful Two Disc Edition, with features that everyone could love.

Idle Hands is a homage to many old movies. The uncontrollable hand reminds me of a Peter Sellers character, Dr. Stranglove, in the movie of the same name. The opening pays tribute to Halloween, while the dance scene is straight out of Carrie. Anton's ghostly friends are just like the ones in An American Werewolf in London. One problem is that Idle Hands is nowhere near as good as the movies it salutes.

It's not the plot of "Holy Grail" so much as it is the humor that makes this film a classic. To fully describe Monty Python's humor would do them a great injustice; it is so unique that it would be easy to spot one of their films a mile away amidst a sea of imitators. In "Holy Grail", this uniqueness works so well it's frightening. Plot elements flow smoothly from one to another (despite the fact each plot element is a separate "skit") and the movie as a whole is a cinematic masterpiece. Probably the only gripe I have with this film is the ending, which was a bit anti-climactic, but other than that "Holy Grail" is perfect in every way.
Plus, let's not forget the gritty fight scene choreography...and Chaney's formidable opponents. Notably the bald, grinning tattoed Jim Henry played by regular on screen bad guy, Robert Tessier...and real life stuntman cum actor Nick Dimitri as the malevolent, well dressed fighter, Street.
5609	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	It staggers me now that when I first saw this movie in the cinema upon initial release back in 1985 I was actually disappointed!  I was 15 then and guess I expected gore and deaths every 5 minutes in place of say a plot, acting, character development, etc...  Since then I have seen the film over 20 times, purchased the poster, soundtrack and the film both on VHS and DVD (not many extras on the DVD version, unfortunately)  This film has great acting by all leads, but Stephen Geoffreys as "Evil Ed" steals the show - my favourite quote is when William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are resigned to defeat by vampires and "Evil Ed" remarks "Then we'd have vampires taking over the whole town (looks out window) - not that it'd be much of a loss..."  Great score by Brad Fiedel ("The Terminator") and attention to detail - smash cut camerawork and great flying effects.  This is an ideal horror movie to show anyone uninitiated in the genre - couple it with "The Lost Boys".  The sequel is also worth watching (once).
The acting is terrific, not in the sense that it carries you away but in the sense that you enjoy watching the  actors. It is a theatrical movie in the best sense of the world. The  beauty, passion and fierceness of Joan just emanates out of Jojovich's face  and voice. The scheming queen played by Dunaway is a joy to behold, as is,  as always, Malcovich playing the prince of uncertain age who will become  the future king of France. Dustin Hoffman, having the unique role of Joan's  conscience, is splendid.
During their trip, they encounter a hitchhiker (Luke Askew, "Manhunter", "The Quest") who they pick up and drive to a hippie commune.  Then the two end up driving through a parade in which they don't have a permit and end up being put in jail.  This is where they meet ACLU lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Terms of Endearment", "As Good As It Gets") and learn that he is a drunkard but has always wanted to go to Mardi Gras.

Picking up where Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) left off, newcomer director Alexander Witt (his only directorial feature, by the way) has turned the clich&eacute;s up hard. Supercop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory; Eragon, The Time Machine) slips out of her heels and into her Lara Croft Tomb Raider gear to solve Racoon Citys zombie apocalypse one headshot at a time in her tight breasty tube top and short-shorts; Carlos (Oded Fehr; The Mummy) likewise receives a nonsense-fueled opening action sequence; and the highly melodramatically written Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris; The Quiet Ones, Poltergeist) wheels out of his McMansion all smarty-pantsish like Professor Xavier.  There is also no shortage of various things random like ridiculous gratuitous acrobatics, zombies rising from the shallowest graves ever, no one ever missing a shot, topless zombie prostitutes, and yet more generally poor writing.

One should not forget Catholicism has been constantly evolving, not to say the least Joan was sainted 500 years after her death by the Church who put her on trial in the English territory, city of Rouen.  Our view on the historical heroine might certainly be evolving too.
Disc Two contains several mementoes:  a film of John Cleese, Terry Jones, and "Grail" production manager John Young (who also played the hapless "Historian" towards the end of the film, and the "I'm not dead!" guy) paying a return visit to Castle Doune , in 2000.  At first it's fun to hear them reminisce at the filming site, but since it's a very small spot with nothing but a wall and a bit of ground, they appear uncomfortable and that  quickly gets old. More interesting is the home movie made by the two Terries when they looked for prospective film locations in the seventies. Their excitement is palpable.
I thought that Travis took Betsy to a dirty movie because he is stupid, not realizing that it is inappropriate for a first date with a respectable girl, but the interview explained that Travis wanted to sully Betsy even though he was obviously drawn to her because she was clean.  I overrated his stupidity and underrated his deviousness.  Since I didn't "get it" the way it was intended, perhaps DeNiro and Scorsese didn't show it as they wanted to.  I can't be expected to read his mind.  That's their job.

This and many other little gems on the CD's (such as two scenes from the Japanese version, and a skit in which an older Michael Palin demonstrates uses for coconuts) make this a worthwhile addition to any video library.
Blu-ray Audio Quality  Midnight Express is presented with a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD surround mix isn't quite as impressive, primarily because the picture's claustrophobic sound design doesn't present many opportunities to spread the audio throughout the soundstage. Most of the noteworthy environmental sound work comes early in the film, during an Istanbul street scene and subsequent chase. The rest of the audio is mostly geared towards the front channels, with the exception of some distributed music cues. Dialogue is mostly audible and clear; though the entire track is mixed a bit too low and I had to crank my system up much higher than usual. The disc also includes the original mono English mix, as well as a Spanish 2.0 track and French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby TrueHD surround mixes.

There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon.

Framed by men incarcerated in institutions accompanied by friends, the film switches expertly between perspectives and patterns - from wide country spaces to cramped interiors whose very shapes seem to offer yet another wall to kick against; from hope-fuelled plans to inept executions; from the need to settle down to the desire to escape; from children to adults, friends to lovers, play to work; from comedy to tragedy, the ideal to real, fireworks to damp squibs, trust to lies, innocence to experience.  And, for genius director Wes Anderson, from the limitations of genre, to the messy, vibrant open-endedness of emotional experience.

Even though this may seem a little sexist and blatantly innacurate; I think they should not have cut Miila's hair.

But there is a fabulous collection of supporting characters here as well: Guthrie Featherstone, the pompous and vain former head of chambers who has now reached his ultimate goal: judgeship. Guthrie, who is greatly relishing the prestige of his position, sees himself as a Solomon-like figure, but is treated like an errant child by his domineering wife Marigold. Claude Erskine-Brown is married to Philida, who's shamed Claude by reaching QC (Queen's Council) before him; Claude is a special target for darts from Rumpole, but the opera-loving, philandering Claude is usually so preoccupied and full of himself that he misses Rumpoles' skewerings. Soapy Sam Ballard is the new Head of Chambers, and it's difficult to determine which of the two--Sam or Claude--is the biggest ninny. There are many, many other rich and vibrant characters haunting the rooms of Equity Court.

Ford stars as U.S. President James Marshall, who boards  Air Force One for a flight, when terrorists (one played by Gary Oldman)  hijack the plane.  Like "Executive Decision"(I recommend you  watch that awesome film) and "Passenger 57" (a cool movie), the  plot revolves around a hijacked plane.  This particular movie is an awesome  adventure and just as good as "Executive Decision" (stars Kurt  Russell and Halle Berry), and to me is even better than "Passenger  57" (stars Wesley Snipes).  Glenn Close plays the female vice  president, and Anne Archer plays the first lady, Marshall's wife.  This  spectacular piece is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, who also directed  "In The Line Of Fire", an awesome thriller starring Clint  Eastwood, John Malkovich, and Rene Russo.
There's a great deal of extra material on the two disks...if you like that kind thing:  going around and about the film from every possible angle -- but often avoiding going deeper into the film, distracting from the take away, homogenizing our experience into movie-making and acting and other trivia, exactly the thing we should seek to forget in order to internalize and participate in the creative experience.

The Python's first movie, Holy Grail re-juvinated the Pythons, and they went on to do another season of their hit T.V show Monty Python's Flying Circus and the movies "The Life of Brian" and "The Meaning of Life". While their later movies are equally halarious, this one stands out beacuse of the sheer amount of gags; the black knight's battle with Arthur, king of the Britons ("Come back here, i'll bite your legs off!"), the coconut discussions, the almost-visit to the castle of Camelot and the classic scene where Arthur argues with a peasant: "Help! Help! I'm being repressed! Come see the violence inherent in the system! Violence inherent in the system!" There's the knights who say "Ni!", the french tauntings to Arthur and his companion: "I fart in your general direction!", and the final battle scene that's one of the most clever set-pieces put together by the Pythons. An unpretentious laugh-fest that's one of my all-time favourites. Classic comedy.
Close Encounters has stood the test of time and it is a film that always will and could never be remade.

Haye's statement after he found that he had been sentenced to thirty- rather- than 3 years. The arguement went something like this: crime is only a question of the will of the majority- there are no absolute categories of right and wrong.

The people who administer this so called justice are- in classic sixties and seventies finger pointing- no better than pigs.
  With all the dystopia banners obvious to anyone who's lost his optimism, Gattaca is about the story of a future society where ID has become one's gene-pool. Those with an "acceptable" gene combination are given access to the better jobs and prospects, and most importantly a chance to leave this planet for outer space, where, by then, humans are exploring domains far beyond their own solar system. Those with an undesirable gene combination, that is, big probability for disease, or other health failures and low life expectancy, are deemed, and doomed, to become society's low-rank water-carriers. The first category is the "valids" and the second the "in-valids".

The sight gags simply don't work very well and until the film actually develops some dialog it doesn't really shift from 'yet another clich' ridden horror film with a big cast' to 'Hey! That was cool.'

7)  BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke:  There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton!  He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward.  There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, "Do you find me handsome?" and she answers "No."  What a laugh!  Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy.  No one could get past this without laughing.  He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward.  On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production!  His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock.  Not attractive, which isn't a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton.  In real life, Ol' Tim wouldn't have looked twice in her direction.  Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy.  So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production.  It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV/BBC production so you can't expect much.  I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it.

Those flaws mentioned and ranted about, there are plenty of strong aspects to the movie.  For one, the photography is just stunning, with some stunning scenery, sunsets, and even Barbra Streisand herself, looking very lovely, and difficult to take your eyes off of.  Another strong point, perhaps what saves this production, are the fantastic performances.  Nick Nolte, Kate Nelligan, and Blythe Danner especially give truly raw performances as complex, emotional, and not always likeable people.  But nobody, not even Streisand and her son, gives a terrible performance.  Finally, the storyline is very involving and heartbreaking, and even the romance between Nolte and Streisand, while a little more prevalent than it should be, is very touching.

The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG scenes with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't otherwise know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This movie does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without going so far as to ruin the surprises.

When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment.

The story centers around Anthony (Luke Wilson), who just got out of a voluntary mental hospital, and his one-of-a-kind buddy Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Dignan has big plans; in fact, he has the next fifty years charted out.  This master plan of his calls for Dignan and Anthony to pull a few burglary jobs and thus impress the local landscaper (I mean, criminal mastermind) Mr. Henry (James Caan) so much that he makes them part of his crew.  Dignan obsessively maps out each facet of his plans, treating them as daring capers of great importance, but Anthony and his friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) tend to get distracted rather easily.  The first job, a little after-hours bookstore robbery, sort of succeeds despite itself, and the trio goes on the lamb until the supposed heat is off, holing up in a cheap motel out in the middle of nowhere.  Here's where things start falling apart, at least insofar as Dignan is concerned.  Bob's all worried about his brother having been arrested for the pot that Bob was growing in his own backyard, while Anthony falls in a rather pathetic - but awfully sweet -  kind of love with Inez the housekeeper (Lumi Cavazos) - despite her limited knowledge of English.  Everyone goes his separate way, basically, but the gang comes back together in order to pull their most ambitious (and, of course, wildly unsuccessful) heist yet.  There's not a great deal of story resolution at the end, but that's okay; the film's ambiguity is actually one of its strengths.
Anyway, I remember when Blue Thunder came out and it's not a movie that you might think it is.

9797	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	One of the greatest sleeper Sy-Fi movies, and certainly one of the most provocative is Gattaca.  The concept of genetic manipulation, while a thought back when this movie was made; is now more of a realization in our current society.  This movie does a wonderful job of exposing discrimination by the use of what is determined by your genes.  Furthermore, it also brings out the fear of altering ones genetic make-up to that of what parents "want" from their selected child.  Hawke is brilliant in the role...a very underrated actor whom I feel has never received his full due.  Law, in his first film role shows what he is and will be made of. Thurman handles her role with grace and elegance.  The remaining cast of well knowns are extraordinary.  Cinematography and "feel" of the film is almost a color version of "film noir".  even if you are not found of science fiction, this film is so well do, and so socially on target, it will mesmerize.  Only issue is that I have the Blu-Ray, which is 5.1 True HD sound.  Sony Pictures has not done a great job of sound quality...by that I mean you have to turn the volume up extremely loud to hear the movie.  Other True HD movies I have, even by Sony, this is not an issue.  This is the one flaw with the Blu-Ray.  It shold be noted the Blu-Ray does contain all the extras of the Deluxe Edition.

However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church.

9930	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Eugenics as a form of social control by governments over its subjects is a very real issue. The formation of a so-called `perfect' human being by way of genetic manipulation is a current science that is developing at such a rate that the ethical issues the subject raises, and the productive dialogue required when artificially controlling life, is falling way behind. In Aldous Huxley's `Brave New World Revisited', he explores a society where genetics is used to create the perfect society, and the ethical and social implications of such a world. He does not paint a positive picture. As the main character, Vincent, in this film proclaims, "Discrimination has now become a science." One's social status in society is solely determined by the perfections or imperfections of their genetic make-up. What does society do with its genetic imperfections? In the film, the lower end of the gene pool is relegated to menial jobs and the streets. Those without imperfections, the biological determined `elite', are placed in the prestigious and important jobs and enjoy all the benefits. More than anything else, I believe, this important film is about the strength of the human spirit over so-called biological determinism. As the main character, Vincent, shows us, the will of the spirit far outweighs one's genetic predisposition.

- Immediately after his attempted assassination of Palentine fails, Travis is seen driving to the tenement house where Sport hustles. Dazed, Travis is utterly absorbed by his psychosis, his face a portrait of a concentrated, murderous obsession. A pedestrian attempts to flag down his cab, but Travis blows right by the would-be customer, occupied only with the slaughter he is about to engage in. I feel that this scene perfectly capsulizes Travis's complete descent into madness.

There are set pieces about these episodes, but they are far from formulaic. Unlike some American counterparts with which one might hazard a comparison, Rumpole does not always win the case, although he almost always solves the mystery. Rarely do cases turn on points of law (indeed, Phyllida Erskine-Brown, the 'Portia' of Chambers once remarked that Rumpole knew nothing of law, but did know how to win over a jury), but the cases usually involve issues of eccentricity, both among those in the legal profession as well as among those who have need of the legal profession. Most shows involve several subplots, and the line between victory and defeat is often blurry. However, there will always be an England, at least in certain ways: As Rumpole said once during a defence, the English nation when it is long gone will be remembered for three things -- the English breakfast, the Oxford Book of English Verse (the Quiller-Couch Edition), and the presumption of innocence - this is Rumpole's mantra, and his statement of faith.

This film is indeed screamingly funny. The opening credits? Hilarious! The coconuts? Inspired! The witch burning? Amazing! The Black Night? Classic! The Nights Who Say Ni? Great! This film may not be the funniest movie ever, but it's pretty close. It's in the Top 10.

When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away.
4039	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh  and refreshing as the year it was made.

He certainly wasn't helped by the dreadful pacing of the first half - it is a full hour before Joan has even got her army, let alone used it - the first 60 minutes being devoted to tedious back story leading to Joan's appearance in the Dauphin's court; by turns voyeuristic (was she a virgin? Spend ten minutes finding out!), gratuitously violent (the murder and necrophilia of Joan's sister), and just plain daft (recurring visions of a remarkably camp Jesus in a forest surrounded by wolves).

In addition, the second disc showcases two unique featurettes about the film; one which was shot on set in 1974 for the BBC, and another which reunites Gilliam and Jones in the year 2000, on the location of the main castle used throughout filming.

Resident Evil is a fantastic movie.  Milla Jovovich did a great job as Alice.  Michelle Rodriguez also played her character extremely well as a matter of fact.

The highlights of course are veteran actors McDowall and Sarandon who turn in perfect performances as the cowardly TV host and vampire respectively. Much like many films of this genre in the 80's, they were a labour of love for the filmmakers; Tom Holland wrote and directed as did Richard Wenk with Vamp. Yes, they are camp and a little dated these days, but the hard work shows on screen. The special effects were probably quite elaborate for the time, but hokey or not, aren't they meant to look a little crooked?

It is set in 1920s Montana, a land that still had some of the Old West left, and as the story says, "a land with dew still on it..."  The real star of the story is Montana itself, and this film I think fully captures the flavor of that place in those times.

I first saw Close Encounters when I rented a VHS tape from the video store in 1998. Roy(Richard Dreyfuss) encounters a UFO while stuck at a railroad crossing. He has a vision of a tower in his mind. Director Steven Spielberg succeeded in casting French film director Francois Truffaut as a French scientist. Melinda Dillon plays a single mother and lovely Terri Garr plays Roy's wife. The special effects by Douglas Trumbull, Greg Jein, Ralph McQuarrie, and Dennis Muren are superb. The animatronic extraterrestrials built by Carlo Rambaldi are first rate. John Williams' music score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind is flawless. The five note motif was spoofed by a school band on a TV show and in the 007 film Moonraker(1979). This film has the iconic scene with Roy making a tower with mashed potatoes. This scene was spoofed in UHF(1989) and The Simpsons.

1264	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	Just a terrible movie.  Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in.  Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.  For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent "Austin Powers".

The making-of documentary featured in the 1999 "Collector's Edition" is highly worthwhile, containing interview segments from Scorsese, De Niro, Shepherd, Boyle, Foster, Keitel, Brooks, Schrader, etc., providing fascinating insight.  It becomes apparent that the essence of Paul Schrader's screenplay was at once captured while also being appropriately flashed out thanks to Scorsese and the incredibly talented actors.  The movie itself has been remastered, and the sound and picture quality are pristine.

5211	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Robert De Niro gives a brilliant performance of a man pushed to the edge in the corrupt big city, that he takes the law into his own hands. Travis is a taxi driver by night, and he encounters many different types of criminals: murderers, robbers, prostitutes, etc. He's getting more and more sick of it. He tries to start a relationship, but it fails, and he looses all hope of there being a decent human in the city. When he sees a young prostitute wasting her life away, he decides to try to help her, anyway he can, and he chooses the violent way. How will a violent world react when he strikes out? The film is masterly directed by Martin Scorsese, who has a unique style. The script is top notch, and deals with many contemporary issues, and posses great insight into the mindset of young angry individuals offended, and rejected by the world. If you like any other films with Robert De Niro you will love this film. People who appreciate top notch film making will get a lot out of this film. This is considered a classic, and I'm not surprised. Great story, great acting, and great directing, 5 stars. If your afraid of sensitive issues, such as violence, or negativity in the world, stay away.

They sell it to a guy right next to an airport and then starts the triumphant tunes The Pusher and Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf as they go on the road with a load of money in Fonda's gastank.  On the road, they run into an understanding farmer, a quirky commune leader, a commune with some really strange folks (reminds me why I occasionaly indulge in the cannibus culture but not communism), two nice girls posing as skinny dippers, a parade, an ACLU attorney who says "Lord have mercy, is that what that is?" when Fonda passes a joint, witty and deadly southern folk and estranged prostitutes.

232	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	The first time I saw "An American Christmas Carol" I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.
In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that "Easy Rider" is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, "Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah." But "Easy Rider," he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America - liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.

9878	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Welcome to a not too distant future where genetically superior humans get all the good jobs, while those born naturally have to piddle their way through the mundane jobs.  Enter Ethan Hawke, the "human" who wants to go to Titan, one of the moons of Jupiter, but to do so has to convince Gattaca, the corporation involved, that he is a genetically enhanced human.  He "borrows" the vital fluids of a crippled VALID, played nicely by Jude Law, and manages to get to the top of the list of space travelers.  The murder of an important director, however, may be his undoing, as his true identity becomes more and more revelant.  Critically acclaimed as one of the more intelligent of sci-fi films of the nineties, GATTACA is competently done, with nice performances from Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin and Loren Dean, but ultimately its leisurely pace and lack of true surprises makes it merely an exercise in style with a potential message overshadowed by its manipulation.  Not one of my favorites.

WARNING: For people who are not familiar with or have never heard of the game, RESIDENT EVIL has strong scenes of violence and gore (not for the weak stomache). THERE ARE SOME DISTURBING DEATHS and alot of (well, of course) frightning scenes.
Those concerns have to do with the aftermath of a bitterly divisive war.  Vietnam vet, Robert De Niro in an unbelievable portrayal, plays the mentally ill insomniac that stalks, a presidential campaign worker, Cybill Shephard.  De Niro doesn't seem to have social graces because on their first and only date, he takes her to a porn movie.  Then he stalks her and transfers anger towards the candidate.  He buys lots of guns.  Then we have 12 year old, prostitute, Jodie Foster taking Cybill's place as a reason-to-save society.
But what of the transfer of this movie classic to blu ray.  Seems like all the classics are being brought to blu ray, some more succesfully than others.  The questions are always how does it look, is it an improvement over the dvd and does it bring the film to new life.  TAXI DRIVER was the first film to receive an enhanced 4k restoration and what it does is perform magic on a decades old film.  The video presentation is purely amazing.  It is funny for when the film starts the Columbia logo is very fuzzy and then the movie starts.  It is clear, crisp with colors strong.  The film is very definitive in that scenes are either nighttime or daytime, dark or light.  The blacks and dark colors are brilliant and all color ratios amazing.  Whites contrast perfectly.  No matter what the scene everything pops.  The night scenes are very realistic and when colors are introduced they are vibrant and real.  Nothing is overenhanced.  Instead the film looks the way it must have when released originally in theaters.  It is leaps and bounds over any dvd version.  The climactic scene at the end is brought to new devastating life with this new restoration.  Flesh tones are also perfect.  Blu ray is put to amazing use here restoring this classic film to all its glory.  The graininess here is meant to be here.  It represents New York City in full detail.  And the audio is just as perfect.  The DTS 5.1 audio allows the amazing soundtrack to fully blossom and soar over the entire film.  The score here tells the story as much as any character or visual.  And dialogue is strong and present.  Nothing is wrong here.  The film itself is told in a way that it is open to many different interpretations but the blu ray itself needs no debate.  It is spectacular.  I will reiterate again.  The film looks as pure and original as when in the theaters restored to its true glory.  Do not hesitate to double dip if you own the dvd.  This blu ray shows the movie as a whole new experience.  I give this blu ray my highest recommendations.
1664	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we began watching it shortly thereafter. Initially I was discouraged with it because the first episodes are terrible. But my wife persisted and after six to eight episodes it began to get considerably better. Within ten episodes we were enjoying it a great deal. I think it was because the first episodes were lacking in pathos and charm, the writers trying to keep things a bit dark like an American soap opera. But when they gave that up it took on a life and personality of its own. The first segments (which were filmed in black and white) also had a stagey quality almost like burlesque where the actors overact to convey their emotions over great distances (unnecessary on the small screen obviously). I also had trouble with the son, whom I don't think is quite as strong an actor as the others (such as the actor who plays the butler Hudson, who is excellent) but he gets better as the series progresses.

More than anything, Taxi Driver is a character study of Travis Bickle and the isolation and loneliness that take their toll on him.  This is a different world that director Scorsese and writer Schrader invite you to experience, if not really enjoy. In addition, there is one of the best documentaries here that I've seen. You'll learn more about the film than you ever knew before, unless your name is DeNiro, Scorsese, or Schrader.

6081	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Jeff Shannon's review is nonsense. He accuses "Midnight Express" of being manipulative. What does he think film making is? Films--and art in general--are nothing more than manipulation in order to achieve a desired effect, whether to scare us, make us cry, or make us laugh. It's all about manipulation. I read Billy Hayes original book accounting his true life experiences in Turkey; overall, the film holds true to the autobiography, although it shies away from Hayes's own self-professed positive homosexual experiences while in prison. I suppose audiences in 1978 wouldn't be able to handle that. In the film, Hayes is shown as rejecting any kind of homosexual advance, although he does so kindly. Regardless, the film is powerful and has visually stunning cinematography, something that is lacking in today's films. This is one of those films you show friends who have never seen it or heard of it. Almost all will come away awestruck. It is a remarkable film achievement. It's one of the top films of the 1970s--and in the decade of "The Deer Hunter," "Jaws," "Star Wars," "The Exorcist," and "The Godfather," just to name a few, that's saying a lot!

This film really moves along at a great pace, the Marylyn Manson soundtrack kicks it up a notch along w/ the action sequences.

My personal favorite part of this movie is the humor. The humor can fit a variety of audiences anywhere between teen-adult (preferably) with lines such as You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you may do with her as you like and then spank me. and You must bring me, A SHRUBBERY. I find this movie to be the hardest to find something bad about, but I would have to say the end credits.
6746	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Gosh, this film disagreed with me. Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise. The tone veers  alarmingly - the opening sequence features Asterix-style comic English  soldiers, pantomime crooked teeth and all, brutally raping and murdering  Jeanne's sister. Later on, Jeanne's expedition to attack Paris is reduced  to a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-style 'attack the castle' fiasco,  whilst the ending tries a stab at indie art, with Dustin Hoffman as  Jeanne's 'conscience'. And it's much too long.

It was a very good movie. My only problem is I hate matrix type movies and James bond type of movies, meaning: Impossible feats that not only leave you saying "yea right" but also are so outrageous they are laughable at best. Ex: she runs down a building on a rope. I thought that was not only impossible, but way cheesy. Movies need to stay away from the Charlie's angels mentality! You begin to stop taking it seriously when you see too much of this. Another nit-pick I have is the fast camera battle sequences. ITS ANNOYING! we all know the scenes. Where the camera moves so fast all you here is grunts from the battle, and a snippet of gore. Hold the camera still you moron!
The reason I gave this review a 1-star rating is not because of the movie itself, but because of the horrible DVD. It's the only one available as far as I know here in the U.S. It's in "full screen" format, which means edited for old televisions and not in its original widescreen format. That, of course, means a lot of the picture is cut off. The so-called 5.1 surround sound is just as bad, with little detectable sound from separate audio channels. It's old, outdated, and is in serious need of a brand new DVD and hopefully Blu-Ray version sometime soon.

The only element sorely lacking in the DVD is the commentary Scorsese did for the Criterion laserdisc edition.
When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.
1676	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is absolutely a wonderful series.  Truly one of the best ever.  It's also a bargain, as the entire series on VHS cost just under $1,000.  Having just studied U.S. History in the period the series covers I understood even better just how well the producers and writers interwove real life events in with the stories of their characters, and best of all the characters are flawed and real and loveable and even gently amusing.  While there are some episodes (The Swedish Tiger) and some characters (Sarah) that I've never particularly liked, the series as a whole is superb.  (And as for video quality people are complaining about here, I don't get it, as I've only ever seen Up/Down on PBS and VHS copies from PBS and this looks just as it always did.)  Don't let this even bother you.  The series is worth it.

Taxi Driver seems like Mean Streets revisited, Mean Streets pumped up on acid and Quaaludes.

And cant wait to get Dawn of the Dead 2004 on DVD!Well any way if you like the first Resident Evil movie,then you should like Apocalypse. My one complaint about the movie the cool soundtrack from the first film is missing,not a Marylin Manson fan but his music for Resident Evil was very good,and it worked very well in the climax of the first movie. It was like an update version of Goblins music in Dawn of the dead. Sad it's not in part 2.
`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.

Jeanne d'Arc is my patron, and I watched the film in the hopes that it would provide insights that cannot be depicted in words alone.  What we do know of her is that at the very least she was humble, not only in origin but in practice.  She also only spoke when pressed to do so.  Having met understated practitioners of humility, none of them scream like a lunatic, which is exactly what Jeanne does in the movie for the entirety.  The thought that a raving lunatic would sway nobility from a local baron to the dauphin that would become Charles VII is laughable.

5246	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece written by Paul Schrader to me is the ultimate film about loneliness and insanity. Two things that Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) obviously is. The movies starts out with Travis going to a cab company for a job. The reason is he can't sleep at nights. At his job he meets a lot of odd people in his cab. But, he also meets his share when off work too. Like fellow cabbie Wizard (Peter Boyle) whom at one point Travis tries confiding in. He really is loney and has no one to be with. All he does is drive his cab, untill, one day he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). She's working on political campaign for some politician. At first she thinks he's "creepy". Tom (Albert Brooks) has I would say a crush on her. At first he tries to "defend" her against him. After the two go out for a brief time. She becomes digusted with him after he tries to take her to go see an adult movie. At this point the insanity kicks in. He now starts to talk about how the streets of New York make him sick. Everyone is "scum". He can't breathe the air. In an effort to "free" himself, he decides to "save" a very young prositute Iris (Jodie Foster). The problem first of all is, she doesn't think she needs to be saved. She thinks things are going ok. Secondly, her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) says he loves her. "Taxi Driver" hits so many right spots to keep our interest. It has so many powerful moments. The acting by De Niro is truly a standout. His Oscar nomination was rightfully deserved. We see this transformation in his character, and to me, it's spellbounding. His "our you looking at me" speech has to be one of the most OVER quoted lines in film history, it's right up there with "What am I a clown? Am I here to amuse you?". Scorsese is a director of considerable outstanding talents and this film allows him to showcase it very well. He also has a small cameo as a jealous husband who is spying on his wife, who is cheating on him. The movie was up for 4 Academy Awards; "Best Picture", "Best Actor", "Best Supporting Actress" (Jodie Foster), and "Best Musical Score".
 Over time, we see the evolution of the characters as the widowed Clairee, who has remained cheerful despite the loss of a husband and son in two different wars, comes into her own, encouraged by Shelby, buying a local radio station and working as a sports reporter; Annelle becomes a bit more stylish, and after a period as a wild woman, settles down with Sammy DeSoto(Kevin J. O'Connor), whom she met at Shelby's wedding, and becomes a Sunday School teacher in addition to working for Truvy. Shelby also inspires the cantankerous Ouiser to re-acquaint herself with one Owen Jenkin (Bill McCutcheon). Later, Truvy's husband Spud(Sam Shepard) will have a generous surprise for her.

9802	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I first saw this movie around 2000, not long after it came out and since I never saw it again,I held this idea of it in my mind all this time as being a great movie. I saw it again last week and was shocked at how much my perception of it had changed. The main character Andrea was terrifically smart academically but  dumb as a post in her thinking process and the choices she made. The whole movie is about her chasing after this guy who happens to be a local rock star. In the process of this chase she does a lot of stupid things like lose her virginity to  a guy she doesn't even really like so she will have some experience  when "Todd" ,the rock star finally gives her more than a passing glance. Other idiot moves including going over a 100 miles to a concert to see him,only not to be able to get in and spends all night in a raining alley. Then she basically dumps her friend Darcy because she didn't fit into the whole new indie rock scene she has inserted herself into to try to get closer to "Todd Sparrow,the rock star." Finally, she gets her wish, and Todd notices her. He takes her back to his place, bangs her, then leaves for another city to record an album and she hardly hears from him for weeks, which of course means she has to chase after him some more. Then, finally she gets the golden prize. She becomes Todd's girlfriend and then goes on to degrade herself by doing things like having sex with him on the floor behind a speaker while his bandmate looks on impatiently and having sex with him in a barn at a concert where people are milling about.

Although there's some genuine belly laughs in it, the story is primarily a melancholy one of two men tortured by a tragedy that affected both their lives in very different ways.
The series itself is delightful and I'm so glad that I purchased it so that I can watch it again and again.  I would brew a pot of tea, pour it into my finest china tea cup, enjoy some scones or crumpets and take myself back in time.  I became so fond of the Bellamy family and even more so of the downstairs family that when I came to the end of the series, I was sad but then, I can visit w/them any time I like, can't I?  There are many reviews here that tell of each character in the series, so I won't bore you w/all that, just will mention that each family "knew their place" in the class system at that period of time and there was snobbery at both levels.  I have my favorite characters, Mr. Hudson and Ruby, to name two of them and I found myself getting really caught up in their drama, especially w/the way that the cook, Mrs. Bridges, treated poor, slow, lovable Ruby.  At times I would forget that it was only a story.  So does that tell you how good the acting is?

The production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the "rape", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.

The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.
The depression era is portrayed in the way that it should be,hard,filthy and above all with a thick layer of mistrust coming from all of the actors,Coburn is great as the mouthy fight fixer and Jill Ireland and Bronson bring their real life love to the proceeding's.

The bulk of the special effects, and therefore the biggest shocks, come during the last third of the film.  But that doesn't mean that the first part of the film isn't scary.  Even in the lighter moments, Writer-Director Holland maintains a spooky atmosphere throughout, and he is helped in this by Sarandon's smarmy vampirish charm and by Ragsdale's convincing depiction of a young man spiraling into the pit of abject fear.

5093	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Martin Scorsese's seminal, defining film finally gets the Special Edition it has rightfully deserved for so very long.  This Two-Disc Collector's Edition of Taxi Driver packs a bevy of special features that not only outline the film's history, but it's impact on American cinema, and the impact of Scorsese to boot.  Featuring a new commentary track from writer Paul Schrader, featurettes and discussions with Scorsese, Schrader, Robert De Niro, Oliver Stone, and Roger Corman among others, retrospectives on Schrader's inspirations on writing the film, and comparisons between Travis Bickle's New York of 1975 to the New York of the present day.  As for the film itself, well, chances are if you're reading this, you already know what to expect here, and you already know what a classic Taxi Driver is.  Needless to say, even if you already own the original edition of Taxi Driver on DVD, this new Collector's Edition is a must own for longtime fans of one of the most influential and important films to come out of the 1970's.

As with the original Resident Evil, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a monster-mashing, gore-filled zombie flick which is unexpectedly entertaining.  The pace is fast, the plot is thin, but followable (and even contains a few surprises), and the acting is typical for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting.  The special effects are decent, if corny at times.
8044	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	With lines like that strewn throughout this odd but extremely likable film it is easy to see why Robin Williams was nominated for the Academy Award for his manic, yet heartfelt work here.  The Original Screenplay was also nominated, and I cannot stress how "original" it is.  The dialogue is unpredictable and outrageous at times but never strays too far from emotional honesty.  There are poignant scenes as well as scenes where Robin Williams it let loose to let his comedic mania shine.  While that would surely be enough for most fans, there is also the wild card actress Mercedes Ruehl, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her endearing performance.  Not to mention she is very sexy here as well (nudge, nudge).  Jeff Bridges and Amanda Plummer round out the eccentric foursome of talented actors to make this a must-see film for those who enjoy a little originality within their movie-going experience.

Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.
  All the more wowing is the fact that effects still look pretty damn good and i saw it in my small living room TV. Sure, it might reek of that 70s aura all along but that's inevitable and it really doeasn't come across as annoying, if anything that even adds to the charm.

In regards to the acting, Harrison Ford Fans or in my case die-hard Gary Oldman fans will be impressed here. A multi-talented and quite younger Gary Oldman emits a more vengeful and retrained type of villain here as opposed to some of the former impulsive, unbalanced psychotic characters he plays. His anger is explosive and expected when provoked and his calmness is professional when in control; he practically has zero empathy for anyone on board as he kills relentlessly with his crew. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, plays a very likeable president; his assertiveness and confidence in times of panic and danger will definitely satisfy his plausibility as an authority figure as well as a favorable president. Besides the main actors, Glenn Close ( The Vice president) along with William H. Macy and Wendy Crewson (the first lady) are serviceable to say the very least.

4070	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Stepmom may not be a definate classic but It will be remembered as a sad sad movie.  It is one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen.  Susan Sarandon gave what should've been an Academy Award nominated performance as a single mom battling cancer.  Julia Roberts has another good performance as well as Ed Harris.  The film does move you and make you feel lucky.  It isn't my favorite, but for anyone who loved Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolias this is the movie for you.
As President James Marshall, Ford is beyond sincere. He is an impassioned visionary. We meet him for the first time at a Kremlin banquet in his honor, giving a speech in which he's about to implode with rage and moral fervor. ``It's your turn to be afraid!'' he warns terrorists. By the time Gary Oldman, as an obsessed Kazak super-nationalist, and his band of Communist mal contents hijack the president's Boeing 747, the act seems like a chilling violation.

It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better, more authentic, and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials, which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway, everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a "prequel" of sorts, telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle, the dungeon, and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.

For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD, the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well!

4221	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I'll confess that when I saw "Last Action Hero" in the theater, I hated it. It may have been because my expectation were for a shoot-'em up action flick, and as the film played out, I realized it was a comedy taking jabs at what was then my teenage self's favorite genre, I was irritated. More likely, it was because my brother and I went to see this at it's Midnight opening, and I was simply tired and cranky by the time the film started playing?! Either way, it wasn't a movie I revisited for quite some time. Flash ahead a few years, and I see it on the shelf at Blockbuster (remember those?...there's one in this movie even!) and decide to give it another viewing. Upon second viewing, I enjoyed the movie much more, and now it stands right up there with some of Schwarzenegger's best films.
Gattaca is a tale of genetic engineering.  It isn't about those who are genetically engineered, rather about one person who wasn't.  Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke, is a natural born person.

All he desires in life is to travel to space, but is aware that it will be impossible due to the fact that he was naturally born, and therefore has vision and heart problems.  He later finds Jerome Morrow, played by Jude Law, and uses his DNA to fool the system.  Eventually, he does make it to space.

many people would have liked woody allen to continue making comic movies like this one for the rest of his life. instead of continuing with this broad farce style, he would develop his own blend of combining comedy with tragedy instead.
That, right there, is the beauty of TAXI DRIVER--its psychology. You can look at it from the viewpoint of a psychopath or, in a less intense light, a narcissist: one who is suffering, suffering having brought that psychopath/narcissist to such a point, and, while trying to rescue Iris, going on many more "adventures" that, for the purpose of film, serve as successful convolutions. Martin Scorsese, with the same gift of the late Stanley Kubrick (RIP, having the directing skills to personally immerse viewers inside his films), applies the same gift to his direction of TAXI DRIVER: most notably with up close and personal shots inside Travis Bickle's apartment, for example, which make us uncomfortable, but are exactly what we want to see as far as knowing what is going on inside Travis' head: which is EXACTLY what Scorsese, along with De Niro in his performance and Paul Schrader in his screenplay, reveal to us.

This leads me to believe that Capcom isn't overly happy with the end result. Who cares...it's solid in it's own right and doesn't pretend to be the game, but rest assured it is well based upon the concept of the game franchise, maybe more in spirit than actual application and a welcome addition.
Regarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.

In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says "It's not even safe here," they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.

Hayworth, wrinkles and all, is still gorgeous; the young Novak, who would not be as much of a favorite with succeeding generations, is very beautiful.  In their last scene together, so brief as to be almost subliminal, Hayworth is just haunting. Sinatra won a Golden Globe for his work; the movie was nominated for four Oscars, and picked up four further awards.  It was undoubtedly sanitized, but it's still unusually grown-up for its time.  It has many memorable, evergreen musical numbers, and three outstanding actors.  They really don't come much better.

Boorman does a terrific job setting up his compositions (with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall), working with the actors. Both Mifune and Marvin were old enough to serve during World War II so, no doubt, brought some of the memories of the racist view that the Americans and Japanese had of each other during that time. I have to say that I prefer the alternate ending to the one that played in theaters as it doesn't pay off on the journey these two enemies make to becoming friends as they work towards a common goal.

1881	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Old but a classic worth watching.  This movie was made in the days when the plot was thinner and the violence was less gruesome (there's still plenty of killing).

I absolutely love Ralph  Fiennes and Sean Connery.  Most of what they have done I have found  wonderful.  I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery's role in this movie.

  Perhaps the most powerful episodes are those dealing with World War I, and the profound waste of the war, as many of the best of the generation are lost.  By the end of the War, there has been tremendous tragedy, and even the most ardent supporter of the war doubts the justice of the war.  But do not underestimate the fifth season, as the social structure crumbles.  The signs of this crumbling are seen throughout the earlier episodes, but they come to a head in the fifth season.

In my pre-teen and early teen years, I was treated to the Star Wars Trilogy, the Raiders of the Lost Ark series, Star Trek - the Motion Picture, Superman - so many great movies for the young (and young at heart).  Out of all the great sci-fi and adventure films of the late '70s and early '80s, I always liked CE3K the best. The best quality of Steven Spielberg has always been his ability to provoke a sense of wonder, and nowhere is that more evident than here.  We marvel along with the characters at the strange happenings of the early movie, and Dreyfuss and company convey perfectly the astonishment of the breathtaking mothership.  Where Star Wars was a fairy tale, Close Encounters is an intelligent look at what might take place if "we are not alone".  As for the DVD edition, I'm perfectly happy with it - the goodies are nice, and let's face it, the whole "inside the mothership" thing was never going to match our imaginations, anyway.  Hard to imagine a serious DVD collection that passed this one up.
5005	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	A rambling, oddball shaggy dog story, but it packs some real emotion and laughs along the way.  Terrific understated performances, and good use of images and music.
Think of this movie more as an action flick with a big budget, undead enemies, explosions, and one heck of a cool setting(Raccoon City). Overall this is a very enjoyable movie to watch. Don't get too technical on it and don't try to find faults or differences from the video game. If you do, you won't like it.
Movie has great music
This 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion.

This is the second DVD release of "Holy Grail" and it's fully loaded. Not only does it have 24 seconds (yes, 24 seconds) of additional footage, it features a terrific audio commentary by surviving Pythons Gilliam, Jones, Cleese, Idle and Palin. The two disc set features wiggy sidebars that include intelligent and fitting subtitles taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV part II (for those who don't like the Python's dialogue), three mindless sing-alongs, a documentary by Palin and Jones: "The Search for the Holy Grail Locations," tons of Terry Gilliuam's wonderful sketches, and "a load of rubbish -- a surprise package of mystery items specially included for the mentally challenged." And much more in the same vein.
 The ensemble cast is rounded out by Michael McGuire who plays Chick Gandil.  Chick is the arch rival of Speed.  He is wealthy but his passion is not the family business but gambling.

Betsy destroys Travis; she's just like all the others. Now, there's nothing in the world worth saving--now, he knows what he must do.

By chance, he stumbles into the middle of a pimp/whore squabble; the whore is a thirteen-year-old girl. Something rises up in Travis's heart, something he never felt before. He discovers something worth saving-- a lost thirteen-year-old whore named Iris (Jodie Foster).

The only other movie that I think can compare to this is Shawshank Redemption, as far as greatness goes.  What movie can show what happens to a man who is alone for too long better than this?  On television today you have a thousand stations all broadcasting the same politically correct agenda, over and over until the wheels fall off.  Put on this movie when you need the anti-thesis to all of that.  Perhaps in yesteryears, their was no need for "a guy who would not take it" so much, because there were simply more of them around.  But if you ask me, in today's world, Travis Bickle is a Saint, not a sociopath.  The real sociopaths all have their own shows on the helevision now.

I can see why this movie failed. The average action fan doesn't like it when a movie is spoofing what it bills itself as. Action fans take their genre seriously.  You have have a specific style of humor you enjoy to get this. At points the movie almost has a cartoon style feel. That things happen for no reason. Personally, I think that adds to the charm of the whole thing. There is a comic book quality here.
The film has some excellent performances, including that of Peter Friedman as a man of the cloth with a long past. It is Jurgen Prochnow, however, who steals the entire show as David Bannon, the mysterious teacher of ancient languages who seems to carry the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Who he ultimately turns out to be is entirely believable. His performance is so compelling that those sharing a scene with him fade into the background. While exuding sensitivity and caring, he also manages to be one of the sexiest men on the silver screen. His performance is what makes this film worth watching.

The fact is that "Steel Magnolias" is a very good, nice film. Have we seen it before?. Yes. "Terms Of Endearment", a better movie, comes immediatley to mind. This movie works because of the cast : Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerritt, and Dylan McDermott. These people give some of the best performances of their careers. The plot centers around a group of southern women who share each other's business while going to a local beauty shop. Another storyline includes Sally Fields' daughter(Roberts)getting married. If you haven't seen this movie, then that's all I'll say. Field gives a great performance. Her outburst scene towards the end is a real stand out. However, MacLaine steals every frame she's in as a sharp tongued southerner. Julia Roberts shines here too. Director Herbert Ross has a nice eye for detail. The film looks sharp. The movie has a fair share of intelligent comedy and drama. Just enough for everyone. So, come on guys!. The whole 'chick flick' title is old. Enjoy movies!. This is a nicely made movie.

Is it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.

A good date film? No, it will kill the mood. A comedy? You may laugh once but probably unintentionally. An adventure? Only if you consider watching the trials and tribulations of a wacked out taxi driver adventurous. This film is all over the place and it never lets you get a grip on what the director is trying to tell you.

5098	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I first saw this movie in its original theatrical run in 1996.  I was a little sceptical going in.  I was thinking it was going to be just another Tarantino rip off.  To my surprise it wasn't.  I loved the characters and the way it was put together, it definitely had its own style.  The characters are what makes this movie so great.  Luke Wilson gives a great performance as Anthony the main character.  Owen Wilson gives an equally great performance as Dignan, Anthony's best friend.  It was easy to identify with the characters in the movie, it was like watching people you grew up with.  The circumstances in the movie were unusual, but it doesn't really matter.  The movie is not really about what they are doing, it's about their relationship with each other and how each they deal with what's happening.  There is also a lot of humor in the movie, which adds to the character's personalities.  The humor really makes the characters and there situation seem real.  It's hard to explain this movie to anyone, because it really defies categorization.  I would definitely recommend this movie, especially those with an offbeat sense of humor.

Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda riding their choppers towards New Orleans and their quest to be free is a classic American movie.  It is a comteperary tragedy that deserves all the praise it has received over the years.

9166	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I think the first time I ever saw this movie was when I was eleven or so, long before the DVD format was even conceived. My dad borrowed this movie on VHS from a friend and subsequently copied it for our own viewing pleasure. Quite apart from the fact that the main movie disk features two movie tracks, one with superior sound quality and even slightly different narration from Michael Palin, there's also a French language track which I watch for just as many laughs as the English ones despite not speaking a word of French myself. And then of course there are two commentary tracks from the various Pythons, minus Graham Chapman for obvious reasons. The story is often way over the top but what else did you expect from the Pythons? Favorite scenes of mine are Arthur's encounter with the Black Knight, the plague scene, the self-abusive St. Benedictine monks, The Tale of Sir Robin, the Knights of Ni (both encounters), and of course Tim the Enchanter and the Bridge of Death. The Special Features disk includes such gems as a documentary explaining how one can obtain and use one's own coconuts for use in fake horse riding and, my personal favorite, a snippet, narrated by Palin if I'm not mistaken, explaining in gory detail how one can sing along with the chant of the St. Benedictine Monks (see the review title), by explaining the proper technique to whack oneself over the head with the DVD box. All in all I'm glad I bought this.

The thing to notice is when he's trying to decide if he should 'do a bad thing' and he's talking to one of the other taxi drivers asking for advice.  One of the things the guy says as he tries to talk him down is that we are what we do.. like you do a job, and that becomes who you are.  This movie is never very 'in your face' about it's message if it could be said to have one at all.  But what does happen?  Either way, Travis is kind of a sick puppy with the desire to kill.  When that desire is aimed at the politician, he's a wacko (he wants to whack him because the girl he loves and who rejected him, is working on his campaign - this would be a kind of revenge, showing who 'has the power' - in his twisted mind).

Then there's Dillon, who plays the mom of a young boy who is taken away. She is determined to get her child back. So while Garr runs away with her kids to protect them, Dillon teams up with Dreyfuss to get hers back. When Dreyfuss is falling back on the mountain, it's Dillon who kicks him into gear. I did find it a bit iffy that a short while later Dreyfuss gives her a fairly warm kiss on the mouth. How quickly he forgets his wife. And kids. And it's also a bit strange that Dillon, knowing her son is probably with the aliens, doesn't want to go too. If I was a mom and my kid was in there, I'd be heading down to get on board right alongside Dreyfuss.

Brad Pitt is perfectly cast here, in the first opportunity he had to show his amazing acting range as the brother hell-bent on doing things the hard and ultimately destructive way in stark contrast to his older brother, played well by Craig Sheffer, who seems more grounded, better oriented, and more likely to be able to carry out his dreams, which ultimately take him away from his beloved Montana. The story basically revolves around the ways in which the choices each makes based on their own needs, perceptions, and personality seals their fates. In this sense it is as much a morality play as a story about the ways in which love and involvement don't necessarily cure all ills.  Of course, it is also a story about the relationship each of the brothers has with their father, a minister who considers fishing more a religious activity than a sport. Yet Pitt's character, a natural fly-fisherman who casts like a dream, is unable to translate this particular form of genius into his own personal life to give him either peace or happiness.

Spielberg came up with the novel idea that perhaps "invading" aliens needn't be hostile. Nevertheless communication between alien species can't be easy. They don't quite know how to go about contacting us and become a bit of a 'bull in a china shop.' Their methods are inexplicable and cause somewhat of a tumult on Earth, but that's why they're aliens, right? We're not the same. Why should we expect them to think the same as we do, with the same respect for personal boundaries and behavior? The complexity that went into the creation of the aliens' behavior and culture is one of the things that makes this movie so interesting.

Knowing that Julie is somewhat paranoid and Karla knew most of the story that Julie went through why is she sneaking around the apartment in the dark with no lights on in the house and if they go to the same school why would Karla think Julie was out of town, looks to me classes are still going on

Though not particularly long, it seems to drag by, and Scorsese doesn't help by leaving so much dead time, it turns into a graveyard, literally and metaphorically.  The theme is poorly conveyed, the plot is vapid and nonsensical, and the acting is fairly sub-par.  The characters are barley there, and their lack of development and history really adds to the convoluted plot.  In the end, it turns into an average testosterone driven shoot-out, leaving you angry and confused.  This, next to "Runaway Bride" and "Home Alone" is the worst movie I've ever seen.

Perhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations, with the coconut shells and so forth. The special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier, such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded. The script is typically hilarious, full of stupid comments and straight-faced jokes.
The film score has many tunes that have become popular standards: `Bewitched', `My funny valentine', `I didn't know what time it was', `I could write a book', `There's a small hotel', and `The lady is a tramp', superbly delivered by Sinatra to Hayworth. Not all of these songs originated in the stage show of Pal Joey but they all slotted in perfectly into the movie.  This is 105 minutes of delightful entertainment.

Some movies have compared Allen's work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can't hold a candle to Fields' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.
And although I would love to see Robson Green in more visible projects, I sort of hope Hollywood never finds out about him. They just wouldn't know what to do with him.
DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam Marine vet, off kilter but moral, who is sickened by the crime, drugs and immorality of 1970s New York City, seen from the taxi he drives night and day. He has an ill-fated fling with a pretty campaign worker (Cybil Shephard), goes off the deep end and portrays himself as a possible assassination threat to a Presidential candidate, although this is never fleshed out. In the end, he commits an act of vigilantism to save the life of a teenage prostitute with potential (Jodie Foster), and like in "Death Wish" (Charles Bronson), is made a hero.

European swallow or an African swallow?  Delicious, satirical, shibboleth-breaking sensible nonsense.  You gotta, just gotta, love it!
Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and a few bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though. The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc)as well as misses(Slater's daughter screaming like an idiot while thrashing a bad guy in her room and the cartoon police cat WTF?). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks.

The artificial stump speeches of presidential candiate, Senator Palantine and the septic bourgeois banter between Betsy (Cybill) and her friend (Albert Brooks) is chilling in an odd way.  It's as though the political campaign symbolizes a "civilized" and benevolent society, and yet it is completely oblivious to the hell that is out there, and thus allows the Irises and Travises of the world to suffer.  One of Palpatine's talking points is ending poverty and crime.  And yet, when he talks to Bickle in a cabbie by chance, his phony political good-guy schtick is perversely transparent, and it's clear that he isn't interested in genuine connection- which this film argues- propels crime and violence.

First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way "Toys" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.

4078	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	I hated this movie.  I lived the "stepmom" role.  I currently the "ex" and my son has to deal with his "stepmom".  Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.  Pass on this movie...unless you are looking for the fantasy of how to deal with a family that is not yours.  Also see the Brady Bunch....

One phrase that implies how illusory and meaningless these artifices is the one on the DVD cover that says---"There is no gene for the human spirit". Unfortunately, those of us who've become cynical about that inner essence of a human that makes us unique and gives expression to us being more than an accidental collection of sophisticated chemicals. Without that recognition of the "soul" oh humans, we become prey to seeing each other simply in terms of genes and eventually slide into the dark philosophies and practices of eugenics, racism, nihilism, and skepticism concerning the existence of an "Unknowable Essence" who is beyond the ken and comprehension of finite minds.

Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from "The Avengers'" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.

Note, if you are expecting a Romero style zombie flick don't see Resident Evil. The zombies are merely a plot device to scare, or bite someone.

Rochester has been described as a screamer, and while I can see why people say that, Rochester IS a very emotional character.  I didn't find that a problem.  I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here!  That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a short Jane Eyre, and all the stuff that was cut out were the things that you tend to want to hurry through when you're reading it anyway.  In fact, I have been guilty of skipping through Jane's childhood in one or two of the versions that I own.  :D  This movie also totally skips the whole issue of Jane gaining an independence, which in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter too much to the meat of the story.

  For a horror movie, it borders on all-right to bad. For a movie based on a video game it's pretty bad. Not much from the original games is really intact in this movie.  Mainly just the monsters and some of the lab type levels from the first two games are intact, but thats were the comparisons end. Although, to give the director credit, he did say this movie was more of a prequel to the games, rather then a movie version.

Fright Night is great horror movie period.  It also spawned a pretty good sequel in Fright Night 2.  However, Fright Night stands fine by itself and I wish future vampire movies would use this movie as a paradigm.  Mainly by having a basic story, good characters/acting performance and special effects that don't totally rely on computer graphics. Overall, a timeless piece of horror cinema which I am sure will still be enjoyed for many years to come.
I really have not seen a movie that I enjoyed on this level in awhile. The performances of both Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams were so fun to watch. It was like they were dancing. I began to think about just how underappreciated I think Jeff Bridges is by most people. I think he does a great job, especially in The Fisher King. I do not feel as though I need to justify Robin Williams' career to any of you...

The superb music sounds like a replay of AM radio of that era, and the scenes still bring a hunger and longing of wanderlust and desire to crank up the bike.  The acting is, of course, what it is - a tad contrived in spots, artful in others, but comes together in mildly appalling reminiscences of those smoky campfire scenes of yore - how did we ever survive those years!

The main reason why PAL JOEY works so well is the delicious score, which includes "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered", "I Could Write a Book", "Zip", and "That Terrific Rainbow".  Orchestrated by Sinatra's frequent musical collaborator Nelson Riddle, the film version of PAL JOEY also interpolates several more Rodgers & Hart standards into the score ("My Funny Valentine", "There's a Small Hotel", "The Lady is a Tramp").
The second Resident Evil (apocolypse) is alot different. poor lighting, quick flashy camera work(can you say music video) the movie has no flow, the music sounds like some old nintendo video game music, the cheesy one liner attempts, it just seemed like a bunch of action sequences that had no connection to each other, the flow of the movie was bad. I wish I would have rented this one instead of buying it. This was also the first DVD that the special features are actually better than the Movie itself.

I don't won't to give too much away because this one's gonna blow your mind and free those brains up for gobbling in no time.

I really think we ought to check the pulses of the two writers because they couldn't possibly have come up with this without having one foot in the grave.

Those who haven't seen "Fright Night" and are serious horror buffs need to check it out. The cast, direction, special effects and make-up effects are all top notch and this movie was cool way before "Buffy", "Angel", "True Blood" or the "Twilight" saga ever came into the picture.
4347	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	If there was ever any movie that celebrated Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's "Last Action Hero." Actually, this film celebrates action movies in general. Directed by action legend John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, Die Hard), this fantasy film about a kid named Danny who goes inside a Schwarzenegger film is loaded with nonstop action, some good laughs, and tons of cameo appearences, including: Ian McKellan, Robert Patrick, Tina Turner, Chevy Chase, Jim Belushi, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Little Richard, and Danny DeVito as an animated cat! This film brings in loads of fun, and the casting of Charles Dance as the villain is genius. Sure, this film isn't perfect, but if you're an Arnold fan it's plenty fun. Sometimes, the movie even works as a spoof of action, like in the car chase scene where literally every single car explodes. This film really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's actually one of my favorite Arnold films. I'd recommend this film to the child-at-heart; to the people who never really grew up. It's fun for the kid in all of us.

MY REVIEW:

1909	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Another intriguing movie starring Harrison Ford.
3918	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I am not the biggest fan of Spielberg. He might be thought of as one of Hollywood's sacred cows, but not everything he's done has turned to gold. A regrettable example of that would be ...Batteries Not Included in 1987. He has done his share of stinkers as well, but Close Encounters of the Third Kind, even more so than E.T., in my opinion, is his crowning achievement. I guess I have a bias towards Close Encounters as far as Spielberg films goes because it gives me such fine reminders of my early childhood (I was just five years old when it hit the theatres in November 1977). Trust me on this, this is one creepy film. Especially the special effects and the fact a lot of it was set at night, giving one the creepy feeling that one might encounter of UFO. Enough has been already said of the film that hasn't been already said. The film involves Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) who keeps having a recurring vision of Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which he is so compelled to go there that it ruined his marriage with Ronnie (Teri Garr). Devil's Tower was the location where Roy will encounter the giant mothership and communicate with the aliens. There are at least a couple of versions of this film. There was the theatrical version where Roy communicates with the aliens in the spaceship at the end but that's it. And then there's the 1980 Special Edition where you actually see the interior of the UFO that Roy went in to. I have seen both versions, so I should know. When you're younger, you mostly enjoy the movie for the visual effects and the fact you got to see aliens at the end (which look very similar to the "Greys" that real life people said they encountered when they were supposedly abducted by aliens). When you're older, you'll find out the movie has a lot of cover-ups and conspiracies involved as to why the area around Devil's Tower was evacuated (truly a treat for those who listen to Art Bell's radio program). It took me so long to figure out what was up with those fighter planes found in the desert, those were the ones that disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945 (several months after WWII ended). If it was any movie that was perfect to watch at the drive-ins back in the 1970s, Close Encounters was truly that one movie. I am not much for Hollywood movies, because so much of it is so hyped and commercialized, or so mediocre, but this is truly amazing and needs to be seen.
Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it. Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.
4065	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other ... the end. Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. All of the acting talent in this film is wasted in support of a lazy, hackneyed screenplay that cheats its audience emotionally. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe.

Pretty soon they are joining forces by truck to head for Wyoming.  What compels their journey?  I'm not even sure Spielberg, as writer and director, knows.  Over thirty years, he has re-edited his movie at least three times--from 135 minutes, to 132 minutes, to a Director's Cut of 137 minutes that leaves out several scenes I remember, including the inside of the space ship at the film's finale.

In addition to the superb performances, The Prince of Tides contains one of the most memorable scores in a motion picture.  James Newton Howard's background music in a number of scenes creates just the right touch.  Its careful, creative blend of instrumentals enhances the film's various moods - awe, heartache, romance, etc.  (I highly recommend purchasing the soundtrack, which also features Ms. Streisand's heartwarming single "Places that Belong to You," not included in the movie itself.)  The cinematography in this film is simply incredible.  Wondrous scenery of lakes, rivers and marshes, as well as sunrises and sunsets, will take your breath away.

9770	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I loved this movie for many reasons.  From an artistic standpoint it is great : the clean, crisp visuals, the very smart melding of futuristic with retro styling, the use of flashbacks and narration.  From a sci-fi standpoint it is equally great : A semi-dystopian near-future where genetic perfection is not only possible through unnatural selection, but is considered the standard.  But what I love more than anything about this movie is the message I take away from it, which can be true in any story, fiction, non-fiction, future, past, or present.  And that message is that persistence, desire, and a will to achieve can prevail against all odds.  I especially enjoy this message because it is so true.  Yes, we do all see the best looking, most athletic, most intelligent, most priviledged among us given a huge head start in life, but how many like "Eugene" do we see in life?  There are many, those with all the tools to succeed, but cannot use those tools, or choose not to use them because of a lack of desire or motivation.  Then there are the "Vincents" of the world.  Not particulary advanced in any way, and even with physical flaws that could easily hold them back.  But they have the desire, they have that fire burning inside them to accomplish their dreams.  In this movie the barrier just happens to be genetics, but in real life it can be many other factors...you may not be the smartest, or have the greatest physical prowess, or be the right race, the right ethnicity, or know the right people in high places, and so many of us in those positions resign to that fact and go about our so-so lives.  The Vincent character shows that special kind of person who can overcome these barriers and realize their dreams.  It is an inspiring story.

Bad stuff happens, and we might even leave everything hanging right at the end.
The really good thing about this movie is that it does not just focus on mindless zombies. In fact, after the first half of the movie, the zombies have a minimal role. The movie shifts its focus onto the Nemesis project, or Matt from the first movie. And the climatic fight between him and Alice was really cool with Toronto's old city hall as the backdrop.

The special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  The special effects were the main one, but the rapport between Steed and Mrs. Peel was excellent.  The two clicked throughout the film, and Steed's continuous snide but light-hearted comments made the move that much more enjoyable.  Watch this fun film and experience some cool effects while getting a laugh along the way.
Second, Brad Pitt, just coming off his star-making supporting turn in "Thelma and Louise," exudes so much charm and charisma as Paul compared to everyone else that it's off-balance. It's not that Pitt overacts or shows off. He's simply a 100-watt bulb next to a bunch of 25-watts. His character needs to be set apart from the others, but he's too far apart. In fact, all the actors, while individually excellent, never seem to gel as an ensemble. Yes, I know, the movie says we often don't understand those we live closest to and love best, but most real families have intimacy even when they lack understanding. In this film, the chasms between the characters are too wide.
Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for being the only evidence of any real magic in this world.

As we've often stated here at Inchoatus, there is a certain charm in going to see some kind of mindless film. Well, this film is utterly mindless. And it has swearing, nudity, blood, and fighting to go with it. If you want to get seriously drunk and go see some women kick ass, then you've probably found a movie. Go rent it and just make sure you're pretty damned drunk when you go see it. There is no reason--none at all--to see it sober. The film is void of any artistic merit whatsoever.
4764	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Bottle Rocket is a 1996 film starring a young Owen Wilson alongside his brother Luke Wilson.  It's possibly worth checking out for that fact alone, Owen especially looks different to his later self in movies, you've likely have seen.  The film was written by Owen along with Wes Anderson.  There isn't really much of a storyline though, basically the two brothers play best (or only) friends, Luke's character has been in a mental hospital, but he's clearly the more level headed of the two.  Owen's character wants to impress his former boss (James Caan, who he doesn't mention at first employed him as a landscaper), by robbing a from what I could tell public library.  There's no ingenious plan or anything, it just happens at one point in the film, and it's not that exciting.  Their getaway driver a rich kid, is constantly being bullied and beat up by his older brother.  They decide to lay low at a cheap isolated motor inn where their driver leaves to deal with his brother's demands.  So hence they are stuck there.  Luke's character becomes infatuated with a housekeeping woman who doesn't speak English, the only language he does while Owen's just sets off fire works and mopes around the place.  There's plenty of opportunities for humour with all the above scenarios but for some reason they didn't go there. In fact there really aren't any laughs in the film at all, the characters all act oddly the whole film but that's it, and that just makes the movie seem unrealistic.
Now what I didn't like.  *SPOILERS*  Some how Umbrella Corporation in less than 24 hours managed to contain the outbreak within a city seamingly the size of Chicago using 30+ foot walls around the entire city.

On those grounds, "Resident Evil" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.

The story's change in setting and story is the decision point for audiences, who can either accept the drama and enjoy it, or groan at the segue from the suicide angle to a romance storyline. Once in New York, Tom begins revealing events from his childhood to Lowenstein, who listens with a caring ear, perhaps more caring than the ethics of her career would allow. As their relationship begins to deepen, Tom reveals more to her, including a carefully guarded secret known only by his two siblings and mother, as well as his feelings for her.

Looking at what is included, we see a whole lot of greatness. I particularly love Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, and Spaceballs, but even films that were less successful, like To Be or Not To Be, are at least enjoyable. The picture and sound quality are excellent, but I don't consider myself an expert on that subject: Blu-ray's great, but I think DVDs look pretty fantastic, too, so once you reach that level of quality, I'm pretty happy with the presentation. The hardcover book that comes with the box is really nice, a loving tribute to the comedic master. Some other reviewers gripe about how the discs sit in their slots, and I would too, if these were CDs that I expected to take out frequently. Since they're movies, which I'm sure to watch a number of times, but not every day, I don't think these slots will prove to be harmful to them.

I don't fully understand the dude who lived with Dandridge. He walked around in the daylight, obviously wasn't human because he was eventually shot multiple times and lived, but a wooden stake through his heart did kill him. His demise was more like a zombie's -- but don't they usually expire when they are shot in the head? When you saw Dandridge's coffin being discovered in the basement, I just noticed that there were two coffin's there. One contained Jerry and the other was open and, I assume, was for the roommate. So...what was that guy? A werewolf in human form? I imagine...and the bullets that Peter Vincent fired weren't silver bullets? Yet can a werewolf be killed with a stake? Whatever...it was still a cool death when he melted into goo and sand.

First, the performance of the lead character was one of the most heartfelt I've ever seen. His desire to explore and be a part of this otherworldly miracle is just stirring. I absolutely loved the score. I think that music and scoring was, perhaps used much more effectively in this time period. The effects, even for an older film, were outstanding and with a little suspension of disbelief-convincing. The space ship at the end is just incredible, as is the return of the other "abductees". This is a great story, and masterpiece by Spielberg. Many elements are precursors for modern day Sci-Fi movies, series and themes in our cinematic experience. I am certainly glad to own this set, and look forward to watching the other versions another time, along with the special features.

Honestly, with out a doubt, this is THE FUNNIEST film I have ever seen, no doubt, the funniest. Why you ask? Well, it is filled to the brim with original and blatantly hysterical humor, that renders the viewer senseless with it's awesome hystericalness. These people aren't afraid to use odd and at times, dumb humor to get their laughs, they don't wimp out, they take all they have and launch it at you, one by one, until the movie abruptly ends.

The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, the suffragette movement, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.

"Fright Night" is an 80s vampire flick for the classic horror fanatic! Paying homage to such staples as Dark Shadows and the Hammer Dracula franchise, this surprising little horror film supplies vampire lore and cliches aplenty, put together so skillfully that the result is this horror fan's favorite vampire indulgence. Of course, this favoritism is in no small part due to spectacular effects and performances! The cast seems tailor made for their roles as they play them, even if some choices seem a bit odd superficially. Hard to imagine this vampire pining away over the centuries for Married With Children's Marcy D'Arcy, but Amanda Bearse plays the role of the teenage object of Chris Sarandon's desires to perfection. Chris, himself, is powerfully convincing and menacing as the hip, 80's vampire. Extremely well adjusted to the times, too. His slave-boy zombie, Billy Cole, is played by an excellently creepy Jonathan Stark, but he's out-creeped by the always somewhat disturbing Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed. Of course, William Ragsdale IS Charlie Brewster, and his portrayal is what propels the film. The icing on THIS cake, however, aside from the teenage victim in the window that I've had a crush on all my life, played by someone named Irina Irvine, is the brilliant performance of one of my all-time faves, Roddy "Bullwhip" McDowall, as Peter Vincent, vampire killer! The late, great Roddy McDowall is definitely the yeast that raises this film from vampire movie mediocrity. Despite the nearly bare bones disc, featuring only a trailer and double-sided widescreen/fullscreen selection, this DVD is a must own for vampire, horror, and McDowall fans alike. Be prepared for some cheezy 80's music and a great time that you'll want to experience again and again! Also, be sure to check out "Fright Night 2," one of the best sequels ever made!

The typical argument in defense of a film like this is, "Of course it's stupid. It's an action movie." Yes: even the good action movies tend to be stupid.

4486	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I really liked the first film because it focused more on suspense than gore. With the sequel, suspense took a backseat. It was basically just hooks in the eyes, throat and chins, and no curiosity as to what might  happen next. Now don't get me wrong. I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is hot as  hell, but the filmmakers could've made it less cheesy if they didn't have  her running around in a wet t-shirt for the duration of the movie. It was  such a throwback to those 80's slasher films. Also, I knew right from the  beginning who the killer's accomplice was. Will Benson! That sounded a  little too much like Ben Willis. I knew originality wasn't in Hollywood's  dictionary, but they could've come up with a name that wasn't so obvious!
I can't say enough about the special effects, especially those in the film's climactic moments.  As a horror fan, I really appreciate the filmmakers spending the time and money to give me such an impressive show.  The plot features a number of clich&eacute;s as well as a couple of "oldest tricks in the book," but the inspired performance of Roddy McDowell combined with the fantastic special effects leads me to bump my rating up from four to five stars.  This probably won't be the best vampire film you've ever seen, but I am sure that fans of the genre will not fail to get quick a kick out of Fright Night.

James Coburn as Speed is the quick talking not entirely trustworthy promoter who represents Chaney in fights through out the South and Midwest.  "Hard Times" is the directorial debut of Walter Hill who shows off a certain realism that would become his trademark in future works.  Still, it is Bronson who is the center of this film.  Perfectly cast as the aged fighter this is perhaps Bronson at his absolute best.  Bronson displays a subtle complexity that is particularly effective in the love affair with Lucy played by real life wife Jill Ireland.  Bronson, who was about 54 at the time of filming, is remarkably fit and completely believable even when the odds are stacked against him.  The story is taught and directed in a crisp fashion by Hill.  The cast is good as an ensemble lifting this underrated feature to the level of very good.  Yet, it is Bronson and that one of a kind face that makes "Hard Times" a true classic of the genre.
If you don't like these kinds of movies, don't  buy this.  However, if you love great dialogue, character studies,  directing, and a fantastic music score, pick up Taxi Driver and watch it  more than once.  You'll discover the genius each time.

However, upon further viewings, I fell in love with the true brilliance of the subtle humor. I still don't like Rushmore, but really loved The Royal Tennenbaums, and in watching this movie, it's like watching the genesis of some great writers, a director, and actors.
Was I the only adult who didn't realize that the actor Mandy Patinkin was the guy who played Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride?! Blew my mind. He was a fun bad guy.

But some characters in this film try to get around that discrimination using trickery and advanced technology. Very much worth my time to watch this movie. I was able to watch it for free because of my Amazon Prime membership. This movie had a great story line, a few twist, wonderful lighting, and creative filming. The costumes were also well thought out and assisted in the noir feel of this movie.

Robert DeNiro becomes Travis Bickle, a psychotic Vietnam veteran who is thoroughly disgusted with the urban decadence and decay all around him. His portrayal is astoundingly uncanny and personal, yet Travis still remains tantalizingly mysterious (I credit this aspect more to Scorsese's directing and Paul Schrader's story). To some degree, I believe every man can relate to Travis's experience. We have all felt the loneliness and isolation, we have all felt the sexual frustration, we have all felt the blood-boiling rage; and, of course, we have all wanted to own a small handgun that we could slide out of our sleeve on a rail so we could shoot a worthless pimp.

Overall: I don't know if it's necessary to classify Fright Night as a horror, but maybe more of a thriller. It lacks true scares, but it has its creepy moments and delivers to a T in the entertainment department. It has its comical moments, but for the most part it's a gripping story that pulls you in within the first 10 minutes and keeps you captivated until the end. They couldn't have picked a better person than Chris Sarandon to play the role of Jerry Dandrige. He's got the smooth looks, an easy going tone in his voice, and a sly personality that makes him the perfect, dangerous vampire. Stephen Geoffreys, who commonly got the role of the nerdy kid back in the day pulls off the annoying, pesky, nerdy friend of "Evil Ed" really well. The make-up effects that went into giving the vamps their true form in this movie are extremely impressive and definitely give a meaning to the word, creep. Fright Night also has a great soundtrack, with the most notable piece being the captivating instrumental version of Come To Me by Brad Fiedel. A similar movie by the name, Lost Boys would make its way out 2 years later and was just as amazing as Fright Night. Overall, Fright Night is a treat as a whole and one of the best and most popular "horror" vampire flicks to ever be made. Awesome plot, spectacular performances, grade A effects, amazing soundtrack. This movie has it all. You can't be a horror/thriller fan and not enjoy Fright Night

But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson has a pretty bad role as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because the President needs to have a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to `SHUT UP!' echoing the feeling of every viewer.
Some of the color quality on the DVD isn't great and some of the sound. I think this is because the series is older. I don't think it takes away from how great the show is or your experience watching it. Ignore the other reviews and enjoy this great show.

However, in this instance, not unlike others after, it was a child who believed with her mind and accepted the very daunting task of gathering her countrymen together -- to combat an oppression, greed, destruction and attack upon the French culture. Would we not have a beautiful French world in grace and honor without Joan of Arc?  A woman, can make or break a country. Yet, it is the folly of man to bring us to that very moment. Heed then, the possibility that she "was" experiencing a deep rooted or subliminal communication. From where else?

5175	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	To be frank, although I enjoyed Scorcese's Mean Stretts, the film did not leave a lasting impression on me.  This does not mean that the acting was poor, rather the script was somewhat simple and unpolished.  Scorcese took a lot more time on Taxi Driver, and this is apparent throughout the entire film.  To begin with, the music score by Herrmann compliments the tone of the movie perfectly and conveys a feeling of loneliness and drifting.  Secondly, the strength of DeNiro and Keitel's acting has improved considerably.
  I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous!

As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.

The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.

It is my favorite style of science fiction -- very real and even probable in its suspenseful plot and deeply human issues. This is the story of a modern hero who fights to fulfill a destiny of his choice, rather than the one dictated to him by society because of his genes. The movie makes you think, will the day come when genetically engineered humans will lord it over normally born people? Of course! That day already is dawning, with some companies testing employees for flaws such as drug use, smoking and certain diseases. Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman lead an excellent cast in a well paced story that gives you time to think and feel. The music is wonderful and the ending both poignant and and satisfying. Highly recommended.

"Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital, Italian LCRS Discrete Surround, French, German, Spanish Stereo.  The film is primarily a musical and features dialogue.  Because it's an older film, I expected it to be more of a front channel soundtrack and I was right.  The dialogue and music is crystal clear and with songs that feature bass, there is a good dynamic range when it comes to the musical soundtrack.

I absolutely love this film, it is filled with so much horror and comedy that you can't really put it into just one genre. "Idle Hands" is basically about pot-head Anton (Devon Sawa)whose right hand gets possessed by the devil and takes him on a wild (and hilarious) killing spree. The plot is simple, but the actors are what bring the film to life. Seth Green, Devon Sawa, and Elden Henson make the perfect trio of burn-outs and are absolutely hysterical. Jack Noseworthy is also good as the Motley-Crue-loving-motor-jock. The film is excellent, but what really brings this DVD to life are the features. We get a commentary by Rodman Flender, Seth Green, and Elden Henson, which is very informative and fun to listen to. You learn a lot of facts from the commentary; like how Seth and Elden won the role of Mick and Pnub, how Devon Sawa used a real butcher-knife for the hand-chopping sequence, Rodman poitning out numerous goofs and cameos by The Offspring, Ricky Martin, and a member of Blink-182, and many other little facts. The deleted scene is actually an alternate ending, which is totally different than the theatrical ending, and there is an introduction with Rodman Flender explaining why they cut it. Even though this ending is good, I still prefer the theatrical ending. Then we get some interesting storyboard-comparisons of two scenes, which are fun to watch if you really like the film. The production notes and talent files are okay, nothing special, and the making of featurette is good, you'll also learn some interesting facts and see how they did some of the effects. Then we finish with the trailers for "Idle Hands" and "Can't hardly wait". The trailer is good, it features a few glimpses of some cut scenes, see if you can catch em'.

Gattaca, which was released in 1997 deals with the theme, presented by Blair Underwood, that multiple egg-sperm combinations by a couple could be analyzed to determine which combination of their genes would produce the most advantageous child. Love children or children born of parents who did not use this form of genetic selection are thus less beautiful, less intelligent, and less talented or athletic than children born of random combinations of sperm and egg.

9272	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	No one can appreciate such a film, such a grotesque and even clownish film, if they do not understand British humour. Everything is systematically put upside down. You will not laugh your head off, and yet everything is funny, but mostly funny strange or funny just plain silly rather than funny AhAh. Every scene is an allusion to an element that comes from English culture or from standard films on or around Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and it is made silly in a way or another. The creativity of Monty Python is immense and probably bottomless, that's why you can't spank him really. It is never gross and yet it is not far from it. And the funniest part is of course the deep anti-French humour that nearly opens and closes the film. Only the French can pour s**t on the head of a crowned English king. But they do. Monty Python also likes anachronisms and does not hesitate to bring some real modern cops into his picture and they even arrest the crowned King Arthur and make him climb into the black maria. No problem for that humorist. And the cops even block the camera, though they do not destroy the film. Some might say that they could have done that to save us an hour and a half of s**t, but that would be unfair because after all there is something fascinating in such exaggerated and overblown humour. Nothing is sacred with them and that may revive your self-criticism to see such ridiculing of what is considered as everyday banality.

4343	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	After his monumental success with Terminator 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger re-united with his Predator director John McTiernan for this action/fantasy farce.  The storyline concerns a young boy (Austin O'Brien) who comes across a magic movie ticket which allows Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger), a movie character who is played by Arnie, to leave his film world and come to the real world.  Get all that?  Good.  Schwarzenegger (who also served as executive producer) is great as he pokes fun at his action roles, his career, and himself.  The cast is sharp (including Charles Dance, Mercedes Ruehl, Tom Noonan, Bridgette Wilson, and Ian McKellan) with plenty of cameos (including Jean Claude Van Damme, Sharon Stone, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick, and Arnie's wife Maria Shriver) and the action is nicely directed, but Last Action Hero comes close to wearing out it's welcome thanks to it's overly long running time and anti-climatic ending.  Last Action Hero wasn't too well received by critics upon it's release, but it still stands as a fun Arnie romp.
They added a very minuscule scene of the spaceship interior. I could have done without it or they could have made it more interesting.

In hindsight, there was simply no way that any picture in its position could have ever succeeded. Not even the biggest film star in the world, which Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the time, could face off against the defining cultural moment for a generation of moviegoers and survive unscathed. However, bad timing was certainly not the film's only problem. Even if not for its box office competition, the movie's poor screenplay, inconsistent tone, and the irritating performance from one of its lead stars would have likely done it in anyway.

It is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that "they are for the children" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks "who acted as this man's neighbor?" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.
4369	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	"The Last Action Hero" is a rare thing- an action comedy spoof that has difficulty remembering what it is supposed to be exactly.

This  could have been the perfect spoof film- team "Die Hard" director  John McTiernan with The Terminator and let the jokes fly. But instead the  movie tries to be serious, then tries to make jokes about the genre, then  goes back to being serious again. The actors are making one kind of movie,  the directors are making another. It ends up a damn mess.

You won't believe how many idiots I've heard that said they would not build a wall around the city and lock everyone in. Obviously they have never played the game. I believe it was "Resident Evil 2" that said they built a big wall around the city. That is where the idea came from in the movie. The difference is, in "Resident Evil 2", they let nobody out. If you were in the city when they built a wall around it, you were not getting out. Unless you worked for Umbrella, but your chances were still small.

Basically the film is about a family in South London. Their everyday life is not exactly the sunniest (to say the very least). The focal characters are Billy, a teenager with a horrible heroine addiction, Ray, a middle age man, who drinks and fights and beats his pregnant wife, Valerie, Billy's sister. And that is what the film is about.
While watching this movie, you may get a sense that it is sort of a western, with the western landscapes and the main characters riding 'iron' horses.  This was the intention of the filmmakers, especially the director, Dennis Hopper.  One of my favorite scenes was at the beginning, right before Wyatt and Billy are about to embark on their trip, Wyatt removes his watch and throws it on the ground.

Certainly the actors did a fantastic job here. You really do feel that you're immersed in New York City, walking the streets, immersed in the harsh characters that can populate the world. I admit it's hard for me to watch some of the overtly racist scenes, with him glaring at African-Americans, with the slurs that are passed. But I also understand that this is a "documentary" of sorts of how things were for some people, and there is some context with how he was abused by those around him. Not that it makes it "right" of course, but it was the way things were for some people.
"This is obviously an underated SCHWARZENEGGER adventure flick!  It was sweet!  The action, the explosions, the humor, the one liners- all good.

3879	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	What more need be said about this other than that it is a film by Spielberg, the insipid director who brought us such films as "Always" or "Hook", other than that he is the worst filmmaker since Bill Rebane? This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent, half-hearted efforts. This film is an incredibly boring, almost plotless, overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death. Also, a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century! We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk. If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS. For your next release, try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk. At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid.
i feel that they couldve done a better job with makeup and effects on the zombies but it looked like they spent alot on the lickers in the movie so that mightve put a crimp in there budget and they had to let some things go as far as in detail.

Both do a fine job as a father and son who really have no use and less understanding of each other.  Of course, there is a crisis (actually a series of crises) that forces them to choose further alienation or reconciliation.  You will have to watch the movie to find out - and I encourage you to do so.
I really liked this movie. It reminds me very much of the George Romero movies, but with more style and more of a budget. There are a lot of frightening moments. You don't ever get a tongue-in-cheek comment or a moment of goofiness that you see in Wes Craven movies. In fact, what horror director can you name these days besides him? It's pretty sad about the poor lack of quality AND quantity in horror. Witness the idiocy of the new Halloween movie, or Jason X. They would make Ed Wood roll in his grave. Resident Evil is grim, gruesome, bloody, apocalyptic, sad, brutal, entertaining, and invigorating. The look of it is  beautiful, lots of greys, blacks, and whites, with Milla's red dress of blood flashing through it all.

The end seemed to be setting up for a sequel (according to the IMDB, one is planned but not even in pre-production), though at least not in an extremely cliched way, and it mainly irritated me because it was a cliffhanger. There's also several CGI shots where the monster looks about as realistic as the one in the actual game; I did not for a moment forget I was watching CGI, and it was VERY easy to tell where the animatronics ended and the CGI began.

So, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production.

The movie was released early in 1996 and though not as technically strong as Anderson's later pictures, it illustrates the genius of filmmaking that he is.  In addition to being Anderson's major directorial debut, the movie is also known as the film that catapulted the Wilson brothers, Owen and Luke, into superstardom.  Luke Wilson portrays Anthony Adams, a young man who is struggling with his identity and purpose in life.  After taking time to recuperate at a voluntary mental hospital, Anthony returns home and meets up with his childhood friend, Dignan (Owen Wilson).  Anthony is looking forward to settling down and getting on with life while Dignan has bigger plans for both of them.  Dignan wants Anthony to enjoy life, too, but through a totally different means than he imagines:  a life of pleasure gained from committing crime.  At first, Anthony isn't willing to join Dignan's wild scheme, but Dignan is persistent and breaks through Anthony's reluctance and gets him to join him on a crime spree to impress Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry, a supposed local crime lord.  Dignan also gets another friend, Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) to join the scheme.  While Dignan goes about planning the caper, Bob tries to fend off his bully brother John, aka "Future Man" (Andrew Wilson--the overlooked Wilson brother) and Anthony falls in love with a Latino motel housekeeper named Inez (Lumi Cavazos).

This is one of those movies that you can watch no matter what mood you are in, and end up feeling good.  This DVD contains the best version of it, too.  There was an original and a special edition.  The special edition cut out the scene of Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) tearing up his yard and throwing dirt and stuff in his window for a scene of him breaking down in the bathroom.  Personally, I find the first scene to be more interesting and entertaining, but the second is more vital to the story because it shows that he thinks he's going nuts and so does his family.  But, not to worry because BOTH scenes are spliced into the movie.  Also, the SE had and extended ending of Neary in the spaceship which isn't spliced into this one.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Seventeen years after its premiere on Broadway in 1940, Pal Joey [1957] finally made its way to the silver screen after numerous attempts by Columbia studio boss Harry Cohn to cast and produce it. Along the way, the central character, Joey Evans, evolved from an irredeemable, womanising heel that preys on chorus girls to a likable nightclub crooner torn between his love for a struggling singer and a chance to further his career with a rich, predatory club owner. The stage musical starred Gene Kelly and was based on a series of short stories by author John O'Hara.

The latter features Terry Jones and Michael Palin travelling through the country reminiscing and visiting the old locations (don't worry - it's better than it sounds!).  Most importantly, the DVD looks fantastic, and the sound is good as well, and if you're still trying to figure out what the characters are saying, you have several subtitle-caption options.  There are numerous other extras, including a version of the song "Knights of the Round Table" with animated Lego figures - hilarious!

Sure, the graphics can get a little dodgy but the performances and perfect casting make it great.  The story, while nothing ground-braking works perfectly here and the direction/pacing are just about perfect.  Everyone nails their roles and it has rewatch value just for being a fun movie to get into.  I love watching it with people that have never seen it - they all get into it right away and have a great time with it.  Like Christine, I would have loved to get it on blu-ray but that scumbag company that released it only does 3K copies and that of course makes the prices skyrocket.  Not doing it - the DVD will be just fine.  Highly recommended.
Are you kidding me? This is a plot? And why do people give it 4 and 5 star ratings? What do you see that I don't? I am actually kind of a sci-fi fan, I like some of Spielberg's later movies (ET, Jurassic Park, A.I.), but this one? No way. It is just plain silly.

Another thing these movies have in common is the pairing of a more sensitive and reflective character with a more rough & tumble and more aggressive character. In the case of INTO THE WILD, the character - who is very sensitive and contemplative - is paired up against the people he meets on his journey along the way, many of which tend to be less graceful and sensitive as he is. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Ernesto is very much like the character that Peter Fonda portrays in EASY RIDER, and Alberto is, also, very much like the character that Dennis Hopper plays. The likeness is astounding. Ernesto, like Christopher McCandless in INTO THE WILD, is always writing in his journal and thinking about the deeper meaning of things. Peter Fonda, as well, is portrayed as the more thoughtful and contemplative one than the rambunctious and womanizing Dennis Hopper. One character is graceful and patient, full of compassion for other people, while the other is less refined and always in a hurry, and somewhat more selfish. They are like The Odd Couple - but riding on motorcycles!

The book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: "Oliver Twist" 1839, "A Christmas Carol" 1843, and "David Copperfield" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story "Great Expectations" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of "Great Expectations" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.
It's [supposedly] a neat idea, and 'Last Action Hero' has a handful of funny scenes to support it. Early on, bored at school, Danny Madigan fantasises about Arnold Schwarzenegger taking over for Laurence Olivier in 'Hamlet' and blowing the hell out of Denmark. In Jack Slater's crazy celluloid universe, the L.A.P.D. is populated by all sorts of wacko cops in outlandish uniforms. Blink-and-you'll-miss-'em celebrity cameos pop up all over, like Sharon Stone as Catherine Trammel, Robert Patrick as the T-1000, and Danny DeVito as the voice of an animated cat detective, to name but a few. The film takes pot-shots at action film clichs like the crusty police captain, the hero's bad puns, the overly-talky killer, the cop killed with only two days to retirement, a chase through the oft-used L.A. River, and many ridiculous stunts and explosions. Arnold Schwarzenegger is plenty game to send-up his own persona and career. And the meta-filmic twists go into overdrive when the main villain Benedict [Charles Dance] who is delightfully creepy, escapes into the real world with a plot to disrupt the 'Jack Slater IV' premiere and kill the true Arnold Schwarzenegger.
  As "they" arrive with lightning-speed craft that cruise the skies of a small american town, scanning and patroling while getting the attention of every local in sight it seems like a collective obsession takes over the residents and the viewers together.

Thousands of viewers can relate to the heartfelt story, especially in today's world, where children have relationships with parents, and step-parents. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a divorced mom, who devotes most of her time to her children, portrayed as a caring, and loving parent. Her ex-husband is Ed Harris, who is involved in a serious relationship with another woman. Julia Roberts plays the role of the other woman. When the two women first meet, they don't agree on much, and there is obvious resentment of the manner in which they both have different point of views in dealing with the children.
The theme of this movie is about seeing the ordinary as extraordinary. It might also be called: "Man, Machine and the Northern lights." Or even, "Pinocchio for Physics Majors." Though "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" suits it well enough. First kind: sighting. Second kind: physical evidence. Third kind: contact. These terms were coined by Hynek to categorize reports of UFO's. Spielberg applies them in a way more down to earth. The ordinary things seen as extraordinary: technology, seen as part of nature, like the northern lights; human beings and relationships, seen as remarkable and unusual as alien encounters--or as wooden puppets become real boys. The hero portrays an ordinary man who is childlike and single hearted. In terms of categorization, the movie might best be characterized as a visual-musical fantasy, though strictly speaking it is of course science fiction. It is quite ingeniously directed and very beautifully choreographed. Superficially, it is about alien contact, but at a deeper level, it is a beautiful depiction of the limits (and limited validity) of a mechanical approach to life. In the end, it's more about human contact, than about alien contact.

UPDATE - This visual characteristic is called "dropping frames," and it usually occurs accicentally during editing when transferring footage from film to digital editing software. When the software is having trouble converting one of the frames the footage for whatever reason, that frame is "dropped". The blur yousee is the footage skipping over the missing frame. It happens rarely, and when it does happen, it's either barely noticeable to the audience , or it requires the editor to make adjustments or find a different method to convert the footage. But in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it appears that the editor is intentionally dropping frames to create this visual effect. Why? Is there something wrong with the zombies that they have to obscure the audience's view of them? Do they think (erroneously) that it makes the zombies scarier? Or are the zombies too visually disturbing that they have to be blurred in order to make an R rating?  Whatever the reason, this is a TERRIBLE visual characteristic, and whoever masterminded this decision needs to go back to college and take a few film classes.

Produced at a time when the American horror film seemed to have lost its way following the glut of low-budget independent shockers which proliferated in the wake of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13th, Tom Holland's FRIGHT NIGHT attempts to straddle the gap between 'traditional' horror and the effects-driven blockbusters which had begun to dominate genre movies in the early 1980's. The plot is a little thin, and there's a couple of items which date the narrative squarely within its decade (notably the disco sequence, and a cringe-inducing theme song by the 'J. Geils Band' during the closing credits!), but Holland's script reserves its major fireworks for a dramatic second half, in which the forces of Good and Evil make their final stand against one another, resulting in a barrage of monsters and mayhem, courtesy of Richard Edlund's superb visual effects.

1508	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I received this DVD yesterday and watched it immediately. Having seen part of it on TV, my initial feelings were confirmed. This is the best movie rendition out of the 4 Jane Eyre movies I have seen. Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester; as I always pictured him, dark, loud, brash, demanding, but hurt and helpless with regard to his situation. Mr. Hinds's acting in this movie prompted me purchase Jane Austen's "Persuasion", starring him, and I find it excellent as well.

If you are a cinema fan, "Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary" on Blu-ray is a film that deserves to be in your collection.  Even if you owned a previous version and not much is added in terms of special featuers content, the film is worth the double dip for that awesome HD presentation and it's rockin' lossless soundtrack.  This film is highly recommended!
The last few years has given us one teriffic release after another; with careful, step by step instruction, perfect camera changes, close ups, encouragement, instruction, and enthusiasm for some classic songs.  Called "Mountain Music" affectionately by forum members at Homespun.com, This two DVD set gives not only the classical step by step (line upon line; precept upon precept) teaching we expect from Homespun, but now gives the student a "push from the nest" as the instructor is teaching students to "flavor" their songs on their own.

LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, " That skit was pretty cool, huh?".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying.

The differences between the book and the film is evidence that Stone possibly used the powerful vehicle of a "true story" to instigate prejudice against Turks/Muslims. Billy Hayes, now 56 years old and living in LA, recently tried[in the Seattle Post] to correct Stone's portrayal of his book: "The message of 'Midnight Express' isn't 'Don't go to Turkey', it's 'Don't be an idiot like I was, and try to smuggle drugs." and, "I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.'"

Resident Evil (2002).
Actors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.

Just as the Godfather is more about family than it is about gangsters, A River Runs Through It is more than about fly fishing. I was thinking it may be about Grace, as in having a state of grace about one's and one's own loved ones destinies. Why is it that the people who need our help the most, refuse to accept it" asks Jessie. I couldn't think of an answer. In reading the reviews of the book and later the movie by critics from the Northeast, I found myself asking why they seemed to miss the whole point of the movie. One reason might be one of scale. The east is small and crowded and I think the people living there prefer to place people into easily definable boxes-"liberal" "right wing conservative" "jew" "black" "hick" etc. Easterners think small. The West on the other hand is big. The land is open, the mountains, rivers and lakes are big and the people are open in their thinking and in how they choose to live their lives. Norman believes he can be a great fisherman, a boxer in college and a intellectual. He doesn't limit himself. Paul defines himself more narrowly but wanting to grow up to be a professional fly fisherman and when that doesn't pan out, does the next best thing by finding a job where most of his time is his own, leaving plenty of time to fish. Eastern critics can't, I believe" imagine such a place. Smug and complacent in their view that the east is the center of all things, they haven't the energy or curiosity to learn about a place different from Manhattan or Boston. That is their loss. Don't make it yours. Read the book and watch the movie.

If MIDNIGHT EXPRESS had been filmed in the early 90s, say, rather than the late 70s, it would have been easy to imagine Pitt taking on the role.  Whether he would have been as effective as his namesake, the late Mr Davis, strikes me as doubtful--but certainly possible.  Pitt does go for edgy roles from time to time (e.g. FIGHT CLUB).  But I guess the key difference between the two Brads is that Pitt became a break-out superstar after only a few films, whereas Davis created a bit of a splash with this one and had trouble following this success with anything nearly as memorable. (Well, there was QUERELLE--which is certainly, uh, memorable).

Also a very minute detail I picked up on was the number of the motel room they stayed in. The room number is 212. This possibly suggests that the two '2s' are Anthony (who has Inez) and Bob (who has Futureman) and the lone '1' in the middle is Dignan. Also the adress of the Lawn Wranglers headquarters is 2215. Again, the '2s' are Anthony and Bob, the '5' is the Lawn Wranglers crew, and the lone '1' is again, Dignan.

JUDGMENT CALL:
After the airing of "The Forsyte Saga" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the "Upstairs Downstairs" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After "Upstairs Downstairs" the pair of actresses combined again in creating "The House of Eliott", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own "complete collection."

All the movies I have rated so far meet this criteria.

"Gattaca" is a movie that addresses one of life's great questions -- does destiny determine how we live our lives, or do we decide our own fate? There are no easy answers, but it's always best to err on the side of "we can make our own destiny" -- and this movie is basically all about one man's quest to determine his own fate, DNA be damned.
I remember how awful this movie was said to be back in the day, but give it a shot, there are some wonderful elements to it, and dream of the day when we can see it wide screen to appreciate the inventive choreography in the "Hard Knock Life" number, which looks so difficult and anarchic.  If this isn't John Huston's very best film it's in my top 3 or 4 by him.  Is that impossible to imagine?

6745	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Unfocused, overproduced, over-ambitious and overlong, that is the best way to describe this uneven period action movie/tragedy/religious melodrama. That's really too bad because it had potential and some great actors in it;  Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman. Starting with the cast,  Mila Jovovich was simply wrong for the role, 'Joan of Arc' is just as  complex a character as 'Blance DuBois', it was just too difficult for her  but who can blame her for trying. She was miscast in a vital role and  overdoes it a lot, but then she isn't even an actress, she was originally a  model that's always been typecast for roles where exotic looks where  needed. Faye Dunaway is under-appreciated, John Malkovich is simply miscast  in a role that makes him look silly and childish and Dustin Hoffman just  plain seems awkward in the role of devil?/angel?/conscience?. For a period  film it is too Hollywoodized, strange considering the French cast and  foreign director, it also fails to capture the times with silly accents and  unimpressive sets, costumes and makeup. The battle scenes have an extremely  low credibility level and look cartoonish. And the 'miracle sequences'  where Joan is visited by God are ridiculous, the guy that plays Jesus  looked more like a freak that the son of God, his looks are really  distracting. It tries to be 'Braveheart' (a much better film) at times but  fails miserably and near the end it violently changes direction to  religious melodrama. This are the film's best scenes where they start to  question whether Joan really saw God and even those sequences are overlong.  And the final burning at the stake, which should of been poignant or  dramatically successful is dull and unrewarding. The stylized direction by  Besson is completely inadequate here, it works well in films like 'La Femme  Nikita' (his best film) or even 'The Professional', but not here. Note: if  Joan really saw God (and I'm not saying she didn't), I wonder why he  preferred the French armies to the English, there's a religious  contradiction right there. God loves all and doesn't wish war and  manslaughter for anybody. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!
9880	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Throw out the idea that this is science fiction. While there are futuristic elements in Gattaca, it is first, (and strongly) foremost a story about people. Few movies leave me in tears at the end, and no "science fiction" movie ever has, until viewing Gattaca. Ethan Hawke is brilliant as Vincent Anton, a genetic inferior with a dream of going into space.
Also, there was the bit where (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) we learn about half way through the film that Slater's son Andy was killed. This presumably happened at the end of Jack Slater 3. So Jack Slater 3, it would seem, ends with Slater shooting the Ripper (the bad guy from the last moive), and then the Ripper pulls Andy over with him. Would a typical Hollywood light-hearted action escapest film really have such a dark ending? Well, then again, I guess Lethal Weapon 2 had a simular ending.

6751	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	If two great film artists, Carl-Theodore Dreyer and Robert Bresson, saw fit to restrict their talents to Joan of Arc's "passion" and "trial," then what on earth Luc Bresson thought he could do with  her whole story is sheer megalomania.  An action film director, he simply  hasn't the skill to capture one of history's greatest enigmas on film -  even with a large budget and an international cast.  And he is clearly  besotted with Milla Jovovich - else why would he cast her in The Fifth  Element as 'the perfect human?'  She is so out of her depth in this role  that she's embarrassing to watch - turning poor Joan into a complete  neurotic.  The film suggests that the real puzzle of history is not that  Joan of Arc led a French army into battle - and won - but that the Dauphin  and his ministers actually permitted this apparent nut case to do so.  She  obviously hadn't the imagination - neither did Besson - to look deeply into  this young woman's soul and find something authentic - like a 15th-century  peasant girl made so ecstatic by her visions and voices (made ridiculous in  the movie) that she convinced enough of her countrymen that she was sent to  liberate them.  I can think of maybe two or three living actresses who  could pull it off, but they're far too old to play a 19-year-old.  Viewers  should purchase the newly restored and gloriously remastered Passion of  Joan of Arc to get glimpses of what art can do with the enigma of Joan.
And lets not forget the needlessly long seduction dance scene which, given this film is pretty old, gets me wondering if it wasn't one of the first movies with such a scene (i.e., a long dance scene whose entire purpose was to be sexy or to seduce, LOL).  There was Return of the Living Dead (1985), although not deliberately seductive there was A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddys Revenge (1985), I only mention the Lost Boys (1987) because that singer might have gotten that saxophone pregnant, perhaps the undead ballerina solo in Evil Dead 2 (1987), then of course there was Night of the Demons (1988) and Night of the Demons 2 (1994) with their blatant and numerous demonic sexy dances.

The movie starts out slow placed with a disembodied narrator before switching to the main event in which the storyline will be taking place. From there the movie introduces the female protagonist, Alice Parks who awakens with no memory whatsoever. She wanders around the elaborate mansion with no clue about the surrounding things within the environment around her. And before she is able to get her head straight she is jumped by a "Cop" by the name of Matt Addison ("The Crow: Salvation"'s Eric Mabius), who is apprehended by several Commandos who swiftly invade the mansion demanding a report from the amnesiac Alice.

  The real joke here is that on the surface, it appears there is nothing to 'get' about the humor that runs rampant in the Monty Python sketches. It all seems so simple and juvenile. Well, that's the true genius of the Python troupe. Their comedy is actually QUITE complex, and works on several different levels.

Still, it's mostly fun, and I have to say that I wasn't as bothered by O'Brien as I was on seeing it when new.  I think Arnie was fairly into it also, and that's important.  Probably average for his ouevre, and for all it's faults, another reminder as to why he really was not just the biggest but the best American action star of his era: he had the best talent around him, and he rarely seemed to take his image as seriously as people like Seagal, Stallone and Norris did.
Overall, I highly recommend this two DVD package for history buffs, military buffs and veterans of World War II. This color footage is actually quite rare and I believe that it has great historical significance.

As much as I love Downton Abbey, I felt that this season of Upstairs, Downstairs credibly explored all the complexities of WW I - focusing more on the personal lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place and how the war affects them all in terms of relationships, duties, and sacrifices. This is one of the best British period dramas I've ever watched, and that's saying a lot given the vast number of BBC period dramas I've amassed over the years. I plan to get the 40th Anniversary DVD of all five seasons of this show to add to my collection. Upstairs Downstairs is truly a timeless classic!

Siena Guillroy is excellent as Jill Valentine and Oded Fehr is a very good Carlos Oliveira. All in all a very entertaining good movie.
It is so over-the-top and patently absurd in its action sequences that it actually can't rate as a movie in the genre of a thriller; it's more like a self-parody of an action movie.

Although it is only a TV movie (not a mini-series as such novels deserve) it is one of the better versions, though I have yet to find one that I distinctly do not like (the older ones, excepting the one I originally saw by Orson Welles are all somewhat DATED in their acting, sets, cinematography and choice of emphasis).  The narration of the story by Samantha Morton, as Jane, gives greater insight into the repressed but passionate nature of the literary character.
2. As a result, to not enough encounters with the Aliens, the film can be quite boring at certain points.  Now when I say encounters, I don't necessarily mean having more scenes where they fly around and buzz people with their space ships.  Not at all, I mean more alien phenoms, like the ship in the middle of the desert or the lost air planes now suddenly found.  These were great, there needed to be more of them.

Charlie Brewster, a typically under-achieving teen, seems to have but two passions in his life:  His love of horror movies, locally presented on late night TV by faded B-movie actor Peter Vincent.  And his girlfriend Amy, whose pants Charlie is desperately trying to get into.  When he spots his new next door neighbor carrying what looks like a coffin into his house late one night, the stage is set for one of the funniest, scariest, and most entertaining vampire films ever made.  All of the aforementioned events take place during the first five minutes.  After that, it's just full-on frightening fun.  Charlie soon begins spying on his neighbor from his bedroom window, and quickly learns just what the purpose of that sinister looking coffin is!

A scene can start off on a moment of abject, wonderful absurdidty. Then, in the blink of an eye, the nonsense is ignored.

Now to get to the aspects of the film that made it so god-awful.
I was probably more scared as a kid when I watched this; now, it still has some spooky moments but I had 'fun' with it. There's a fair amount of blood, but it's the teeth of the ghouls...noises and sound effects...and eerie locations that add the most to it. It was a bit emotional, too, especially when 'Evil' is dying from being impaled in wolf-form by Peter Vincent and is in the process of converting back to a human. The half wolf/half human and then fully human 'Evil' reaching out to Vincent was something. Roddy McDowall appears honestly affected by this and must feel sad as well as simultaneously relieved that the monster didn't get him. Remember that everything he's seeing was for real and vampire movies were coming to life before his very eyes. He was a fine actor and will always be the genuine vampire killer.
9783	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Trying to find a good movie now days is kind of hard, so many of then is a waste of time. This one I wasn't so sure about either but I found it to have a good story line and it kept me interested. It had a good ending to it.


This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.
Travis is not really that specific about his past, all we know about him is how old he was (26), his clean driving record, and that he was once in the military, nothing more, we don't know where he grew up, of his parents (with the exception that they're wedding anniversary and "mother's" birthday is in July). In one of the essays on "The Catcher in the Rye," Holden is reffered to as a "rebel without a past," this seems to be the case with Travis Bickle.

Unless you were lucky enough to have a widescreen laserdisc in the 90's, or the widescreen DVD that was available shortly in the early 2000's, you've most likely only seen the film in an awful pan-and-scan presentation with 40% of the picture missing (and the opening credits squished into the frame).  And if you were lucky enough to have either of the widescreen versions, you wouldn't have the bonus features from the later full-frame "anniversary" DVD release of 2002.

When Dandridge became the bat, I liked that a lot and, especially when he was destroyed, I thought it was awesome. It had a lot of old, practical effects and makeup that were really good for the time. I'll pick puppetry and classic effects over computerized, fake stuff any day. The remake will most-surely be filled with expensive CGI and that will make it lose appeal for me. However, I love magic and to have the Peter Vincent character be a stage magician instead of a horror-movie host is an interesting idea. Will Mr. Vincent use illusion to trick the vampire into his demise? I think that idea could be used well.

In order to watch for 2 plus hours essentially a one-character tragedy, that one character has to be interesting.  As Schrader's script is written though, Travis isn't as compelling as he should.  De Niro's performance is good, especially in his early scenes when his social ineptitude towards Cybill Shepherd's character is sweetly endearing (he takes her to a porno theater on a date and can't figure out why she's offended).  And when he says to his cabbie friend (played by Peter Boyle) that he's worried about "bad ideas" you see a man slipping from sanity, while at the same time trying to preserve his morality by "saving" a young prostitute (Jodie Foster). These short scenes of De Niro interacting speak volumes, and it's unfortunate that Scorsese and Schrader primarily chose to depict De Niro through his rituals, which as I said earlier, have little nuance and feel static.

7205	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This Jackie Chan-produced film is a wonderfully entertaining taste of the next generation of Hong Kong films.  This film has a very MTV feel to it, the way it fuses popular music, fashion and martial arts.  The script is forgettable, but who cares.  Even the fight scenes aren't as crisp as anything Chan would do, but, once again, who cares.  This movie is meant to be a one-and-a-half hour daydream,  and it works.  Highly recommended!
I don't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set, you'll get 3 tapes, with two episodes per tape (except on one tape where there's the "bonus episode," which makes three episodes on that one), for a total of 7 episodes. The tapes are not copy-protected.
-Sound quality is very good.  "Whisper" in the vent is very subtle and creepy.
Also, the end of the film remains a mystery, we're not really sure about what happends to Travis after the shootout, others would easily say that Travis recoveres from a coma and slowley returnes to civilization, but we're not really sure of wheather what happends is the reality in the film or Travis's final thoughts as he slowely dies from his wounds after the shootout. Most would want to believe that the ending is the films reality, (including myself).

Everyone I knew loved the science fiction film Gattaca, so by the time I watched it, it had quite a bit of hype to live up to. Surprisingly, it lived up to every bit of it, and I really enjoyed the movie! Coming from someone who generally hates futuristic movies, my recommendation should be duly noted.

950	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.
From a 9/11 perspective, it's like we saw September 2001 coming -- it was clear in this and other similar terrorist films of the 90s -- life imitates art it seems.

He has absolutely no clue of the deep sh*t he's in. No fine rattling Camaros in the High Green American Summertime for Bill Hayes, no sirree.
Romantic side is highlighted over a complex, dark family story, with Streisand enjoying the starring female role to the full. She does so alongside the great performance by Nick Nolte, who plays Tom Wingo, a teacher from American South hiding much of his painful past until he gets familiar with New York psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein (Streisand).


But I still love the film!
The only thing missing on this DVD is the option to view the movie INCLUDING the missing scenes like the ones aboard the spacecraft. You can view the deleted scenes, but it would have been nice to view them as part of the movie as we were able to do when a special edition of the film was released back in the early 80's.

Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin commentary. Shot in March and April. Opening titles got huge laughs at Cannes. There had been a bomb scare at the theatre, though, so the fire brigade stopped the film right after the opening credits, pulled out the audience, and then they went back in and watched it, the audience thought it was a gimmick. Llamas, moose, Nixon, fish of any kind  old Python favorites. Discussion of Michael Palins mud-eating, which is never used/seen, Palin lost it on the 14th take and beat the ground with his fists. Michael is a sweet-tempered man, but even he can be can be goaded to fury by directorial perfectionism. Says Cleese, There is a version of this story in which this outbreak of most unusual bad behaviour on his part  much supported, I have to say, by all the spectators  was in fact occasioned by his discovery of the fact that hed never been on camera at all. I only heard that version recently, I hope its true. One of the rare ad-libs in the movie. He hasn't got s*** all over him  definition of a king. Original film was a collection of sketches that only had Arthur in a few scenes, and even went into modern day, Harrods, and others. The natural world made the film look great. The original soundtrack was one of the first sacrifices of the 16 or so pre-release test screenings. Black Knight scene comes from a story Cleese had heard from 1957 of two roman wrestlers who had become so entwined that the victor died! Cleeses one-legged stand-in was named Richard Burton. The voice of God is also Graham Chapman, so when He is talking to Arthur its really Graham talking to Graham. Neil Innes is the porter whos crushed by the Trojan rabbit. The old historian is also the guy whos not completely dead yet in the Bring out your dead scene. Neil is brought in because none of the Pythons could sing. John Cleese didn't like this scene, he thought that it was too bitchy. Smoke, air of menace. Cleese thought that the Glasgow girls would have been sexier if they were London girls in the Castle Anthrax scene. Lots of snickering about the girls who were cast for this scene. Meta-comment  where the whole scene would comment on itself!! Restored many years later. King and Prince Herberts guards scene John Cleeses favorite scene, he says it twice. Wide shot only, no close-ups. Lancelot running towards Swamp Castle had to be re-shot, because it was blurry, they did it on Hampstead Heath as well. Look carefully, there are two peasants pulling Roger the Shrubbers cart. Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were major investors early on. Animation after the Knights of Ni second scene introduced to move plot along more quickly. Cleese nearly blown off of the crag. Total cost of film: 229,000. Electric donkey bottom biters!! Idle: Gilliams visual sense is unbelievable. Cleese on the army: We recruited them for fees of about a banana-and-a-half each a week, and they turned up and were immensely helpful and fun and enthousiastic.

The film is characterized as a woman's chick flick, but that is wrong. This is a film for everyone, and gives us a chance to cry a little. This is a film for entertainment,to sweep us away from our troubles and to concentrate on the troubles of others.

The movie is 5 stars all the way, but I do have on complaint. On the packaging, you are promised a completely remastered version of the movie, but the picture is as gritty and dreary as ever. And it's annoying as hell to see little parts of the movie in crystal clear picture on one of the bonus features. I mean, why they didn't just do that for the whole movie?
4796	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	At last Ive gotten around to watching this famous older film.  It is of interest both as a piece of art and a piece of history.  In the argument over whether or not the media prompts violence, it surely must still be of interest that the film depicts De Niros taxi driver as developing the notion of killing the Presidential candidate and rescuing the young hooker Jodie Foster, and that John Hinckley subsequently tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan to prove to Jodie Foster that he loved her.

My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.

2365	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	Compared to '97's other action smashes Con Air and Tommorow Never Dies , this meandering nonsense is the definable example of studio overbearing. It's slightly better than Face/Off maybe,but it still very poor. The action itself is slow moving and uninvolving,and nothing that hasn't been done ten times better and to more exciting effect in earlier highjack features like Passenger 57 and Under Siege. Harrison Ford is nauseatingly mundane,routine in his leading man role,doing the usual mumbling act he's done in previous action roles. He's showing his age really badly too (but he still should have got the role as Jack Ryan in The Sum of All Fears instead of Ben Affleck,dagnammit!)Meanwhile,Gary Oldman is laughably OTT as the rashan terrorist ,while Glen Close and William H. Macy are totally wasted in their roles. The story itself is completely unbelievable and insults the viewer's intelligence beyond breaking point. For one example out of many others,in one scene,Ford uses a mobile phone to make contact with Close and we all know that in real life,this would cause the plane to crash. And towards the end,it doesn't half drag on like anything,just when I thought this dire mess was coming to and end,it just went on more and more until I was close to just turning it off and walking out. For an impressive instance of Ford's action man status,check out his turns as Jack Ryan in Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. And sign a petition to get him as the lead in the new film,not Aptless Affleck.

7848	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	One of the all-time best movies ever made, this lyrical and nostalgic film made by multi-talented Robert Redford lives on a long time after the final credits have rolled. It's a screenplay written from a very short coming-of-age-in-Montana memoir by Norman MacLean. A River Runs Through It concerns the lives of two brothers (one steady and reliable, the other a bit of a wild scamp - that would be Brad Pitt). Their minister father is the quintessential early century patriarch who gives both sons the gift of the art, beauty, dance, mystery, and sacrament of fly fishing, a strong metaphor for Life itself.

There couldn't have been a better actor to play Travis, than Di Nero. It's as if he was born to play Travis. He does a superb job, of conveying Travis's acute sense of anguish, rage, and steely determination, to rescue Iris from her sordid existence. An excellent supporting cast graces this film too; especially Jody Foster as Iris, Harvey Keitel as the vile pimp, and Peter Boyle as a fellow taxi driver, and confidante to Travis.

If I hated the movie so much, why 2 stars instead of 1?  Simply put, there are two scenes in this movie worth watching.  The opening scene of the Lowcountry marshland and the last scene showing Nolte driving a car over that same marshland.  Everything in between is simply horrible.  The last person in the world who should have directed this movie was Barbra Streisand.  She is undeniably one of the great talents of our time, but this was a mis-match.  It should have been directed by someone who is from the south and who understands the south.  And Tom Wingo should have been played by a southerner - or at the very least an actor who has mastered the southern accent.

There are probably precious few souls who haven't seen this at least once, so there's little I can add about the movie itself that hasn't already been praised in earlier reviews.  I was especially pleased with some of the special features on this DVD, including the "tutorial" on how to maximize the use of coconuts for a full equine "riding" experience.  Needless to say this was done in the classic Python style by Mr. Palin himself.  Also great was the "Camelot" song-and-dance routine done with Lego figures -- brilliant!

What really makes this box set special are the bonus features.  Audio commentary is provided on several episodes.  The bonus disc includes the original, unaired pilot.  In it, Peter Bonerz plays Dr. Jerry Robinson as another psychologist, instead of an orthodontist.  Marcia Wallace does not appear as secretary Carol Kester, nor does Bill Daily appear as nutty navigator and neighbor Howard Borden.  The 19th Anniversary special is also included.  It takes place on the day after Bob had a dream about being a Vermont innkeeper named Dick Loudon.  The most surreal moment of the special is when they show a clip of Bill Daily as Major Roger Healey on the "I Dream Of Jeannie" TV series.  The bonus disc also includes "Group Therapy," which was recorded in Los Angeles in December of 2013.  It's a nostalgic discussion of the show with Bob Newhart, Peter Bonerz, Bill Daily, Jack Riley, and director Michael Zinberg.  Sadly, Suzanne Pleshette and Marcia Wallace had both passed away, and are sorely missed in the discussion group.  Bob and Bill do show their age, while Peter has held up well.  Sadly, Jack Riley had a stroke, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair.  This look back to when they were all in their prime is bittersweet, as time has taken its toll on all of the participants.  Fortunately, the TV show's comedy is timeless, and has held up very well over the years.

The Audio is DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lossless audio clearly makes a heck of a difference.  All audio levels are nicely balanced and the dialogue doesn't fight with the musical score which is mostly a soft jazz.  The score is very nicely spread across the front stage and the separation of instruments is in a very comfortable stereo spread.  The audio of the film is the only reason why I dropped this film down a star to 4.  There is no use of your rear channels or even the front left and right channels, nor your sub LFE channel at all.  Even during the shooting scene at the movie's end, where a gun shot should have been placed via a discreet channel, all the action, all the dialogue and all, except for the jazz score, is coming down your center channel.  Not clear on why they did not use any directionality for the many foley effects but that is the only negative.

3177	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Easy Rider is a truly landmark film in the true sense of the meaning of the term.  Produced on a very low budget and set in the late 60's it was, in my opinion, the first movie to really capture a particularly interesting moment in time.  While many films sort of used the notion of the late 60's, drugs, sex, rebellion, idealism, as a means to make money, this seemed really the first film to accurately reflect a realistic image of the time period with an unflinching eye.
There is also some great symbolism in this movie as well.  For example, if you look at the name Jerome, and the word Genome, they rhyme.  Given that Jerome has perfect genes I do believe that this was intentional on the part of Andrew Nicolli, the director.  Also, in one scene you see Eugene pull himself a set of stairs that have a structure similar to the double-helix model.  Then there is the title itself, Gattaca is composed entirely of letters of bases found in a double-helix.

I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner.  Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.

One of the best movies made in this lifetime.
The movie is about two brothers, one who was brought into the world in this accepted fashion and a second who was conceived in the traditional way (though s*x) and the love of their parents.  Almost immediately after birth, the parents notice that their engineered son is superior in so many ways to their other son but their god-child has an indomitable spirit so much so that he crawls his way through all obstacles and and makes some of the greatest sacrifices imaginable for the shot at being a member of a prestigious astronaut corps.
The ending is begging for a sequel (but you know that already) and - I have to admit - it is a great ending (and it alone worths the whole film!). Great art direction (doesn't have much to do with the game). Good soundtrack.

504	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  "Hollywoodized" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one! Originally shown as a 2-part TV mini-series by TNT a few years ago, I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release - uninterrupted by commercials, and including a making-of featurette.

(The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')

Overall, the film works for me. I would never call myself a zombie connoiseur but, with some minor reservations, this does its job very nicely. There are plenty of shocks and thrills, an elegant sufficiency of gore and you can play the "who gets it next and how?" game with your friends. Bargain! The zombies themselves are well executed (actually, that's quite a good double-entendre, isn't it?) and the setting is suitably claustrophobic: indeed, being set in an underground research facility ("The Hive") does lend the film an constricted, linear, escape-down-this-corridor feel to it that actually recalls the game series quite nicely.
6835	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	First off, you should realize just by the title that this is a popcorn flick.  It focuses on horror, suspense, gore, big guns, and the occassional naked Jojovich.  I watched this movie on a whim, expecting it to be horrible drek.  After all, it's based on a computer game (which I've never played) and the previews were AWFUL.  However, against all odds, I found myself absolutely LOVING this movie.  Great beginning, great suspense, great pacing, great soundtrack, and a great ending that keeps on giving you more just when you're afraid it's over.  Let's put it this way: I have a little under 200 movies in my collection, and this has just become one of my favorites.  This is not intellectual or deeply moving -- but it is fun as heck.

"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town" tells the story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus. It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.

Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Olivia Dukakis, Shirley Maclaine, Dolly Parton, and Darryl Hannah are the main stars of the movie.  It starts out as a group of women in a beauty salon getting ready for Julia Roberts' character's wedding.  We meet Darryl Hannah's character in the beginning as she comes by looking for work and a place to stay.  The story goes over a period of time from Shelby's wedding to the birth of her son and her kidney transplant and her death.  At the end of the movie, it shows Darryl Hannah's character heading off to the hospital to have her baby.  During the movie, Darry's character went to beauty school, fell in love, got married, and became pregnant.  Too bad that a sequel was not made.

His wife,queen Isabeau of Baviere, signed the shameful treaty of Troyes which pretty much gave all of nothern France to the English. The city of Orleans was the limit of what was left of the French Kingdom. The dauphin (prince)Charles was waiting for a miracle in order to reconquer his father's kingdom. He was supported by Yolande of Aragon, his mother in law(supremely played by Faye Dunaway) who pretty much managed to keep what was left of France together.

Settled in San Francisco, Frank uses Rita  to finance his new supper club, but cannot give up his star act, Kim Novak.  All very shallow, and a rather nice (sweetened up) ending.

 The plot itself is that the apocalypse has come around and it all evolves around the upcoming death of an unmentioned person/situation who we later see in the movie. The movie involves an old poem/source called "The Gulf" which is also known as the hall of souls. A mysterious stranger comes to town and rents out the room subletted by Demi Moore's character Abby. It is shown by the very start that he is the ressurected Jesus, who has come to start the signs and cause destruction. After each seal is broken another nightmare ensues.  An a subplot there is a situation involving Abbys unborn child - apparently before this pregnancy she had not been able to carry her last infant to full term. Her mental stability is based on the survival of her pregnancy and the stress of the events coming forth are not helping. We get to see her flashbacks, dreams, fears, excitement for children, worries for herself, ect., while she is trying to figure who this stranger is and if he's in any way part of everything that's going on. Other mysteries insue and we as the audience are drawn in and held tight. The husband Michael is out of the picture a lot of the time working at his job but he is apparently worried about the health of Abbie. When he's there he adds, when he's not the plot continues without fail.

I could continue to go on about the analysis (and trust me, I COULD), but I want to touch on other areas of the film. First of all, the acting is absolutely spectacular. Owen Wilson's portrayal as Dignan is one of the most 'real' performances I have ever seen. It definitely helps that he co-wrote it with Anderson. Luke Wilson was also great as Anthony. There is one scene that really shows his talent. It is when he and Dignan are stuck on the side of the road after their car breaks down and Dignan refers to Inez as the "housekeeper". The look in Luke's eyes after he says that is actually kind of chilling. That takes skill. Robert Musgrave was definitely well suited for Bob and his performance is definitely on par with Owen and Luke but he was just given less material to work with than them. James Caan gives a very unique performance as Abe Henry. It was an odd but effective choice. AND YOU CAN'T FORGET KUMAR! Nothing makes me laugh more than when Dignan walks in on Kumar sitting on a couch while he should be cracking a safe.
While the book no doubt is fuller and even better, I feel the movie more than held its own (Granted, I Have Yet To Read The Book). I loved the supporting characters like George Carlin and Gould, the real-life son of Barbara Streisand. Streisand was incredible! She showed that she can indeed direct a top tier movie with a top tier cast. I only wish that they had made a cinematic sequal (Like They Did For Godfather & Jurassic Park) because I wanted to know what happens to the characters 10 & 20 years later. What are Tom Wingo's daughters like in the 21st century?

6897	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	This film falls flat in many aspects. I really wanted to like this movie, but the only reason for this was because I am such a huge fan of the games. However, I feel that this film does not do the video game classic justice. It DOES have an all new story, and it DOES have all new characters. However, this surprisingly is not the reason that I disliked it. I am rather thrown off as to why this film is getting such good reviews by other Amazon.com customers, because in my opinion, the movie is a mindless escapade through one obstacle and another. The film tries to go for intense plot twists, however, the makers of the film must not have realized that if they want intriguing plot development, an existent plot is required. The video games really do give you a sense of uneasiness, however, all this film offers is a brainless combination of Night of the Living Dead and Die Hard. People say that it's no big deal that the story doesn't follow the game, but it is. Reason being, the film IS based on the game, so I'm sorry, but YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE GAME'S PREMISE. I don't give juvenile reviews based on how attractive the lead stars are, OR on the blood content, I base them on how good the movie was, hence the two stars.

Woody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.
THE BLU-RAY/DVD COMBO SET: I wasn't sure about ordering this, as it was a non-US release, but took a chance based on the recommendations of other Amazon customers. Shouldn't have worried. This Blu plays just fine in Region 1 machines. The picture & sound jump in quality from the old DVD release is like day & night. A 4k restoration results in a super-sharp picture, with little in the way of dirt & debris not much artifacting, pixelation, edge-enhancement nor crush to spoil it. Vibrant color palette, without accursed over-saturation, bleeding or the villainous use of DNR to ruin the original vision of the cinematographer & the director. Likewise, the soundtrack & audiomix are worlds improved. The mix is properly balanced here now, allowing you to fully enjoy composer Brad Fidel's haunting, sensual score, without it overpowering the dialogue scenes. The BIG bonus for fans of the film is the wealth of fantastic bonus features, the best of which is a thoroughly exhaustive 'Making of...' piece that's almost two and half hours long!!! Lots of other great stuff is included as well. This Blu-ray/DVD combo will likely be THE definitive edition to own for some time to come. Do yourself a favor and buy this! (Score some brownie points with a friend who doesn't yet have a Blu-ray player and give them the DVD .)

Next time it becomes available, I'm going to buy it!!!

The accuracy is surprising, considering that it was adapted from a novel written by an author who generally knows better than to let history get in the way of a good story. In this case, the bending of the facts, mostly in characterization of some of Washington's generals, was relatively restrained, and supplied conflict that was real, if not always attributed to the correct historical person. Thus, the literary license does not get much in the way of history. Many of the small details are correct to an exceptional degree. All the characters, whether historically accurate or not, are well portrayed as people of the time. There is enormous subtlety here.

On the lighter side, the commentary does provide some fun moments.  It becomes clear after twenty minutes that all four are devoted to the video game series, and Michelle sounds like a die-hard fan of my own caliber, spouting reference after reference.  Also, it's kind of funny when they go off on tangents.  There's a hilarious moment when Milla and Michelle are arguing about one aspect of the movie, while at the same time, Paul and Jeremy argue about the music of the film.  It's obvious that they don't take the commentary too seriously, and they apologize for it routinely, and inform you that the real answers will be given in the production designer's commentary.  Unfortunately, this commentary doesn't exist.

A!  "Annie" has never looked better.  There may be a few people who saw a 70mm print in 1982, but if that isn't you, it's probable that this is the best you've ever seen.  That being said, "Annie" was filmed in the early 1980's, and so it looks like a film from the early 1980's.  A little more grain that we might be used to, but kudos to Sony for staying true to the look of the film and not trying to eliminate the grain with over processing.  The picture is sharp and natural, with the orphanage scenes looking suitably drab and monotone, and the mansion scenes nicely detailed.  Watching it with my daughters (who have only seen the widescreen DVD), there were several scenes where they said "I never noticed (insert detail here)!"  That's a sure sign of a good presentation.  There will no doubt be some flaws that are noticed for the first time (several scenes exhibit an odd oversaturation on the light bulbs in the mansion, which I suspect are in the film source), but all in all the HD video is superb, and sure to please any fan.
I found the pastor father reprehensible, stuffing HIS beliefs down his son's throats before they were old enough to decide about religion for themselves. He was just a small-town fish trying to be something bigger, basically on a power-trip.

And boy, did this movie need some sin so you wouldnt fall asleep!

Travis is a quiet and lonely man who is turned off by the scum and filth he sees on the streets of New York. He becomes enthralled with a beautiful campaign worker who eventually turns him off. Then he also comes in contact with a young girl who makes her living working the streets. His frustration deepens and he begins to work out and collect weapons. It becomes obvious he is about to explode and after an initial failed attempt he does  just that. However, ironically the aftermath leaves him as a hero. Travis is an interesting character because you feel sorry for him and yet he does things that are truly wrong. I found Bernard Hermann's score, the voice-over narration, and the cryptic ending all to be interesting parts of this film.

 It's a zombie movie! For crying out loud, this is what people paid money to see and they give a very poor account of themselves. In this is where the film really falls apart- the zombies just didn't look dead enough, for the most part. It's like the make-up artists gave up before they were finished. The zombies didn't looked decayed enough, weren't feral enough, weren't missing enough body parts or bleeding enough. In short, they were one of the least satisfying portions of the film. I want gore...not scene after scene of high tech equipment and mean spirited characters with very few redeeming qualities. Dawn of the Dead could get away with being a character drama as well as a satirical portrait and scathing indictment of our consumerism-based society. Resident Evil is about gore and killing zombies in as many disgusting ways as possible and nothing else. Worse, the music had me reaching for an icepick to puncture my own eardrums it was so terrible.

But the wait was worthwhile. Our eponymous hero, if we can call him that, was played by Frank Sinatra (Gene Kelly in the 1940 Broadway show). He is a shallow, down-and-out, womanizing hoofer but, for all that, radiates charm and wit. In the movie, he has to choose between two gorgeous ladies - Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. Tough choice! Novak is a timid girl from the chorus line while Hayworth is a former stripper who has pretentions of being a society lady.

All in all, I gave the DVD 3 stars, and the movie 5, which obviously averaged out to 4.  If you want a good horror or sci-fi flick, or are a big fan of the video game series, this DVD is just right for you, and it's not too expensive either.  Otherwise, you might want to just stick with a rental.

There was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about "freedom" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film.
Aside from the fact there are fabricated characters such as Dustin Hoffman's "Conscious," it was historically inaccurate.  John Malkovich was too old to play Charles, the interactions Joan had with the English were looked over in order to spruce up the special effects of the wars and it just simply concentrated on the wrong topics of her story.  I wanted to know more about Joan, not watch the soldiers brutalize each other.
There is a very awkward cut in the special edition (and in the director's cut) dealing with the Neary family, where Ronnie is first sitting with some of Roy's junk in her hands--and then, just moments later, when it cuts back to her--we see her holding her daughter instead. In the original edition, the scene of Ronnie holding her daughter is the first time we see her.  Teri Garr did a great job as Ronnie, though in my opinion she gave a more nuanced and moving performance in, 'The Black Stallion.'

7016	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	The Resident Evil series is by far the best RPG game to ever hit the video game circuit.  So when I heard the movie was going to be made ... I was excited.  But ... I've read reviews of what the movie was going to be about and the road they were taking on the concept and storyline, then it occured to me that the movie was going to be very bad.  I thought it was going to be another B monster movie with a popular title slapped onto it.  I saw it on opening day and I'm glad to say that those reviews weren't correct and the movie was awesome.  There was so much of the video game that was in the movie.  I would say 80%, maybe more.  There are plenty of hungry flesh eating zombies to creep you out, zombie dogs, a crazy supercomputer, the T-virus, and the licker.  The main star Alice (Milla Jovovich) reminds me so much of Jill Valentine from Capcom's "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis" that the movie makers could of just named her Jill.  But I guess they wanted to have different characters in the movie.  By the way, she is hot.  In any case, the movie is especially great for fans of the game, but also can be enjoyed by horror fans as well.  "Resident Evil" definately has a lot of heart stopping moments that can raise the dead and I would recommend this to you, Resident Evil fans and to you zombie lovers worldwide.

However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.

When Travis meets a twelve-year old prostitute (Jodie Foster, in a extremely profound and witty introductory performance), his motivations for violence and release are geared towards the awful individuals who have taken this poor girl into their possession and are encouraging her into a filthy profession.  This hatred for filth causes Travis to explode, creating a tormenting, horrific climax that will be remembered as one of the most severe in film history.  "Taxi Driver" is certainly an acquired taste and not a film for all adults.  It is a strikingly honest tale of how the inner troubles of a man can be extremely exaggerated, to the point that he knows no boundaries.

Again, I'm being biased.  I am not the film's audience, the audience are young impressionable girls who loved the band's songs.  This movie understood its intended audience, that's why the Spice Girls went on an S&M club, they let their pregnant friend drink alcohol, they wear revealing outfits, an alien nearly copped a feel on Scary Spice, and their agent threatened to hang himself live in concert if the band didn't show up.  But seriously, the audience for this movie is limited at this point.  It wasn't long after the movie's release that Ginger Spice followed her own independent example and left the band, which cause the foundation to crumble and the fans had to move on.  I could say the Spice Girls are gone for good (and no, I'm not counting their world tour stunt a few years back that lasted only a week), but something life has a funny way of turning things around.  If New Kids on the Block manage to get together&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/and-release-an-album-not-too-long-ago/dp/B001LN2W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">and release an album not too long ago</a>, it's possible that this girl group would rekindle their friendship.

The romance is what seems normal in life, enjoyable and touching.  It's a beautiful movie in many ways.  I'm not a fly fisherman, but I loved learning and seeing the art of it.  For the time of 1915..., the pastoral father did not buy into scripture that says spank "spare the rod spoil the child" - seems unusual for that day.  He drew me closer to him over time; while stoic he comes through with love; this surprised me in a pleasant way.  I was touched by sibling love that is pure and enduring; this is the best part - saying less is more.  Good life messages are shared. I like the narrative style, pondering and insightful about a life from beginning to end.

4471	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer," if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore.
Of course, it's also easier to make a great film when you have great actors, and Scorsese really had them on this shoot, including Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Cybill Shepherd, and Peter Boyle as Wizard, another whacked-out cabbie who at first seems just sane enough to try to mentor Travis -- until you realize that, despite his "Wizard" moniker, there's just no "there" there.

SLC Punk! is the deceptively simple tale of two punks, Stevo (Lillard) and Bob (indie film favorite Michael Goorjian) trying to survive in the counterculture of perhaps the country's most boring metropolis, Salt Lake City, Utah. Professing a belief in anarchy and a general confusion about such heavy topics as drugs, the opposite sex, and what punk really is, the two, coupled with various fringe players, spend long hours cooking up ways to take down the system without ever actually doing so.

3854	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is such a great, great, great film. It succeeds on so many levels and this new directors cut is the best presentation of this film yet. Many scenes are restored to the film that I think add nicely to the build up and some have been removed that add to the mystery at the end, such as not showing us the inside of the ship from  Richard Dreyfuss's perspective. Also the use of Devils Tower, a black monolith combined with the eerie choral overture is a Spielberg homage to Kubrick's 2001. It is interesting to note that the government organization that is researching the aliens use the illuminati pyramid as their symbol indicating to the audience the secret society connections, they even have their own flag. Also I believe that Spielberg is clearly pointing out to us by the way the aliens arrive in clouds and thunder with flashing lights that they may very well be the God of the bible. Them choosing a mountain to appear for communication, descending upon it in cloud and thunder is right out of the old testament. Also the smaller ships have a definite face or animal like appearance and remind one of the visions of the bible prophets and from a distance can appear like stars in the sky when they mimic the big dipper which could also explain the ancient worlds fascination with the stars. But to remove all doubt Spielberg holds a church blessing on the team that will be going back with the aliens, as the minister gives the blessing he reads from a passage of the bible talking about angels lifting us up and in the background is a Christian cross side by side with the star of David. A deeper film than many believe and overall a beautiful DVD transfer with incredible sound.

I'm glad they fired that idiot Romero from this movie. I've read his script. You can tell that he's never played the game before they hired him to do the movie. He based his script off the first Resident Evil game, and he ruined it. Chris had eagle friends? Jill left for the mansion first? Rebecca was always with Chris? No!!! He ruined the whole thing, and his style of zombies is pathetic.
In a nutshell, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  It is a movie definitely worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History.  4 Stars
Like others have said, this film takes its basic premise from "A Hard Day's Night", then goes wild. This thing covers a couple of days in the life of the girls and leads up to a monumental concert at the Albert Hall in London. It begins at the end of one concert in one town, at the end of which they board their Union Jack-covered tour bus and move on. Thing is, the bus is more than ten times bigger on the inside than the outside, a tribute to "Doctor Who", I gather. That's when the fun really starts.
Dreyfuss logs the bulk of the screen time, and he easily carries the film.  As his marriage melts down in the wake of his obsession, he manages to maintain our sympathy and interest.  Truffault is a surprisingly effective actor, even when speaking through an interpreter.  Even the child that gets abducted has a great performance.  Likewise, the pacing and suspense through the first 2/3 of the film is flawlessly executed by Spielberg, not revealing too much and intercutting short bursts of action with more contemplative and personal scenes.
7824	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	"Preachy"? "Self-Important"????  Good grief... Some people just feel the need to throw insults at anything.

Togetherness still remained, no matter how far apart they were physically, or the depths one of them may fall. What a great movie this was. Also, the cinematography and music was outstanding, capturing every moment. It's a shame that some people forget about the entire scope of a film, and just want to jump on the negatives. You'd really have to go out of your way and come up with BS like "self-important", or start jumping on the "Hollywood liberals" to rate this any less than 4 stars.

It's a hard-knuckled punch-fest with great character and a beautifully rendered depression-era New Orleans - just marvelous to watch.  The transfer to Blu Ray is immaculate - I can only hope other Charles Bronson classics such as Chato's Land & The Mechanic get the same Blu Ray treatment when officially released.
Despite an occasionally ridiculous story and quite a few implausibilities, Air Force One never fails to work as a nail-biting actioner. The suspense is palpable, thanks to likeable characters and hissable villains.  There's also the sense of iminent danger and gutsy unpredictability that director Peterson infuses the film with. Hostages are killed every half-hour, and perhaps even those you expect to live through the situation are killed off pretty quickly; the terrorists are not the slightest bit unflinching or unwavering, making for effective villains.
3153	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I can't help, but ask that question. I really wasn't that impressed with this movie. I feel that it really didn't explain what the 60's were all about. I feel that what it did was tell everyone "Party, and you'll be alright." It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right "We Blew It." I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album "Do What You Like".
5081	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Before Fight Club, before Blade Runner, before any of the nihilistic urban-decay movies there was Taxi Driver.

But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special "jump start" this year.

When it came time to review this movie, I could not do it. That is, I could not do it without also reviewing it within the context of two other movies that I had just recently watched because all three of them have such a similar theme. In fact, they all have so many things in common that I decided to review all three of them at the same time as a medley, something I have never done before but which seems called for. If you'll follow me, you'll see what I'm getting at.

Fast forward to a few months ago. Now middle aged, I decided to give this series another try. At first, it seemed OK, but I wasn't sure if I'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series. Didn't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV. But, I watched a few more episodes and got more interested. Before I knew it, I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done. I was sad to see the last episode end. The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.

6507	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I was rather disappointed with the first Resident Evil. It was an alright film, but it wasn't anything memorable. But this, this is a movie I'll be getting as soon as it comes out on dvd. This movie has TONS of action, and the zombies look real this time around. Remember how last time they looked kind of...stupid? Not here. The zombies look like they came from actual humans this time. The character's are pretty well developed, although sometimes Jill's toughness is kind of forced and she comes off as though she has no personality. She should've left the toughness to Milla Jovovich's character, Alice, since she kicked ten times more @$$, was tough, AND could cry at the end. There's almost no computer generation this time around, save for the lickers, which not even hours of worth of make up on an animal or human being could create. Speaking of lickers, this time the lickers(yes, there's more than one) are much more like themselves in the game. One even used it's tongue to kill someone! Yay! Anyways, now I move on...to the minuses. Dun dun DUN. Nemesis is probably the biggest weak point in the movie. While he resembles the Nemesis from RE3, near the end he begins acting a little...well...like a good guy. And although Nemesis looks real, in that same aspect he looks, well, silly. Also, the ending is kind of stupid. However, I'm not going to give it away to those of you who plan to see it. Even if you weren't interested in the RE films, Jill's hotness and Milla Jovovich's awesome frontal at the end make it worth seeing.
(If you've never experiened an unbridled reaction of this kind to absurd comedy, brilliant slapstick, or general silliness, then you will never like this movie. Your life will be devoid of humor ever after and will no longer have any meaning. Move along.)

For me at that time, "Punk" just meant that you had a weird haircut and strange clothes.  Certainly I  now have a better understanding of what that was all about -- but really,  that has very little to do with this film.  SLC Punk is less about blue  mohawks, safety pins and shock value than you might think.  This movie  makes social and political statements that transcend "Punk."

Flip-flopped in the Special Edition and Director's Cut are the night sighting picnic with the India "Where did these sounds come from?" segments, which, I think, flow better in the order they were presented in the 1977 version.  The cut between the night sighting picnic that turns out to be noisy helicopters and the subsequent dead-quiet of the observation station is more jarring in the latter two versions than in the 1977 version, where the noisy helicopter's search light on Roy cuts to the cars arriving in India in sunlight.  But, in the grand scheme, of the timeline of chronologically telling the story, one can see why Spielberg flip-flopped the order of these two scenes.

That's not to say he doesn't still indulge in his passion for vibrant details.  One fine example is Dignan's notebook, outlining his 75-year (!) plan for success.  It goes by quickly, so you'll have to pause if you want to read each page as it flips by.  I recommend you do.  It's a marvel of low-key ambition and wrong-headed planning.  And Anderson's passion for music, a character unto itself in his later films, is more subdued, but no less effective, here.  Mark Mothersbaugh, a frequent collaborator with Anderson, again provides the score and again does a flawless, eccentric job.
Directed by Alan Parker (he was nominated for an academy award for this film), screenplay by the seemingly always controversial Oliver Stone (he won for best adaptation of a screenplay from another medium), the film stars Brad Davis (Chariot's of Fire) as Billy Hayes, the man who escaped and wrote the book the movie was based on...also appearing are John Hurt (he won best supporting actor for his role), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie from the Vacation movies) and Paul Smith (Bluto, from Robin Williams' Popeye movie).

"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" belongs in every movie collection and now thanks to Blu-Ray, it looks and sounds better than ever. If you are hesitant to replace your DVD player with a Blu-Ray player, then this version of this film should force your hand.
As a P.S.; The last book of the New Testament is called "Revelation." It's singular, there's no final "s," it's "The Revelation To John," if you want to get technical. It's not called "Revelations."
It's not about the Bible, and it's not even about Jesus; they are secondary elements in this story of a very troubled woman with a history of medical and emotional problems, and an act of unconditional love, on her part, as well as the Savior's. I believe one of the aforementioned reviews calls leading lady Demi Moore a "trailer camp bumer" and they say she was "choosen" to save the world. What's a "bumer?" And how is someone "choosen?" This is what our High Schools turn out, year after year. That can be even more frightening than most movies. There's no "trailer camp" here. She and her husband live in their own home, and rent out a room above the garage. And it's not above some landlords and/or landladies to root through someone's belongings, wrong as it is. She is a seriously flawed human being, flawed, but in the end forgiven. She's not a particularly pleasant person, but why should she be? To sell more movie tickets? ("Moore" tickets? I just kill myself sometimes!)

Those who never lived the 80's will probably be shocked at the amount of cheesy fashion sense draping our actors. The younger generation must remember this movie was made before their time and should forgive the 80's tackiness. It is unfortunate that many great films were made during this fashion disaster decade and sometimes the actors wardrobes provide unintentional laughs.

The film is about a group of best friends in Louisanna who come together when one of them loses their daughter. A splendid film, "Steel Magnolias" will make you laugh and cry. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone says, "The ladies are live wires. Just stand back and watch them set off sparks".

And though I usually despise films that trumpet their soundtracks as a reason to see the film, in this movie the musical cues work really well, both in content and placement; not only are classic tracks by Exploited, the Stooges, Fear, the Ramones, the Vandals, the Velvet Underground, Adolescents, and Dead Kennedys featured, but oftentimes they are included at very appropriate points in the plot. The best example of this is when Minor Threat's "Look Back and Laugh" begins playing as Stevo contemplates his loyalty towards his best friend Bob. (For those of you not in the lyrical know, the words go, "One day something funny happened, but it scared the s--- out of me/Their heads went in different directions, and their friendship ceased to be."). But the real kicker is that the track is pushed back in the mix before the second part of the lyric kicks in, so in order for the musical cue to make any real sense, you have to know the song on your own. Nice.

This is by far my favorite version of Annie and I adore most of the songs that are in it.  It is true that they changed the story from the musical and left out a couple of songs, but they just kind of took out all of the political stuff, which most children wouldn't understand anyway.  Annie definitely has the feeling of the Great Depression era though, especially through the costumes, which are very dingy and dull looking.  However, the actors really sparkle in their roles and do a wonderful job.  My favorite is Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan - she is hysterically funny!  Tim Curry as Rooster and Bernadette Peters as Lily also have some great presence and were fun to watch.  It is true that the musical is cheesy and smarmy and all of that, but I love belting out the songs with the singers and always feel good after I watch this movie!

Mortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!!
Portraying the great King Arthur is none other than Graham Chapman, a lovely actor who has various quotable lines and an iconic personality. If you don't quite understand what I mean you simply have to watch this movie. There is not much to say in means of acting and oscar worthy performances. In fact, this movie truly defines a whole new way to look at acting. (You probably didn't expect such a deep review on such a film). John Cleese is of these iconic acting performances playing such characters as Tim and The Black Knight. If I were to praise any talent above the rest it would have to be him. This man played so many various characters and did each one just as well as the rest. Every word he said in this movie has to have been quoted hundreds of times. Look at the title of my review for instance Tis but a great film, using the line from the film, Tis but a flesh wound. A moment so great I will do you the favor of not spoiling it. If I had to choose one character that I felt fell short, it would have to be the cow hurdled at the knights of the round table. I felt his performance didn't leave much of an impact and I didn't feel like he had much meat to his character. The performance in other words was an utter disappointment.

The Roy in the bathtub fully-clothed sequence, which ends in a horrible screaming match that involves the whole Neary family, followed by the Roy yanking out the neighbor's chicken wire and throwing bricks and dirt into his kitchen window to build his ultimate Devil's Tower model next day, perfectly segues into Roy's wife, Ronnie, taking the kids and leaving for her sister's, for good, in the Director's Cut.  In the 1977 cut, we don't know what the heck Ronnie is talking about when she says to Roy, in the morning, "I'm sorry about last night", and, in the 1980 Special Edition cut, the entire Roy throwing dirt into the house scene is excised, cutting from Roy realizing that Devil's Tower has a cut-off peak, to Ronnie taking the kids, which also doesn't make sense.  I'm glad Spielberg finally got it right by including BOTH scenes in his Director's Cut.

I'm sorry, the LJ character is so blatantly offensive. Do we really need the loud-mouthed black comic relief these days? The only way this would have been more offensive and cliched is if they had some Vaudeville-esque performer in blackface tap-dancing and eating watermelon throughout the film.

For us the film was worth of four star rating off the two simple facts that Eclipse is the first face you see on screen and Apache from the immortal&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;makes an appearance. Yeah that's right Apache, awesome. That also lead us to believe Arnold is a big fan of Apache's work since he also had him play the exact same driver role in Predator. Yeah you have no idea what we're talking about but you'll just have to say "well I'm not used to that but that's fine." Unfortunately Sid was on the cusp of quite a nerve racking situation thanks to the real life 40 year old virgin and couldn't enjoy Last Action Hero quite as much as we wanted. Despite that the movie was a laugh riot filled with soundboard lines and goofy dialogue. It's one worth checking out for the Arnold enthusiasts out there.
7829	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This is the story of two brothers (Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt), sons of a Presbyterian minister (Tom Skerritt), growing up in rural Montana in the early part of the 20th century.  All three are passionate about fly-fishing to the extent that it becomes a form of worship for them.  As the years go by, the family begins to grow apart as the older brother makes a life for himself in another part of the country and the younger brother, though remaining close to home, drifts away from his spiritual upbringing into a life of gambling and alcohol.  Yet they always have fly-fishing, a bond that allows them to periodically and temporarily reestablish the closeness that has been lost.  This film is very interesting and moving in the way it portrays the tension between the reality of children establishing their own lives away from their parents and the resulting sorrow and nostalgia over the weakening of familial bonds.  It also explores the mysterious way in which some people seem to be drawn onto self-destructive paths./
The first disc contains the movie itself, along with some choices of how to watch it.... subtitles, commentary by directors Terry Jones & Terry Gilliam or by John Cleese & Eric Idle & Michael Palin. Then "for people who don't like the film", there's subtitles from Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part II".  Now, these  do not faithfully follow Henry IV verse by verse, but they do come from the play, and it's hilarious how the phrases Shakespeare wrote do actually match up with the action on the screen.

I avoided watching it for a long time because I had read so many conflicting reviews. I now realize that every negative review I read has one or both of the following in common: The reviewer hates Barbra Streisand, or the reviewer thinks that, if the movie doesn't follow the book exactly, the movie is bad. Occasionally, someone will mention something else, such as a dislike of Nick Nolte or of George Carlin, but most of the negative reviews are based in those first two biases.
2389	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I still don't understand why everybody seems to love Air Force One so much.  First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.  Sure the DVD is a nice way to show off your sound system, but there's something seriously wrong if you consider that reason enough to go out and buy this movie...

Columbia Tristar has given us a truly awful looking print of this film.  Colors are muddy and undistinguished.  Everything takes on an orange characteristic that is unbecoming to the story.  Night scenes suffer from low contrast levels.  Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement are all present throughout the print.  Fine grain elements and regular wear and tear have not been cleaned up for this presentation either.  Flesh tones are inaccurately rendered, either too orange or too pink.  There's a considerable loss of fine detail throughout, presumably because of noise reduction equipment used in mastering the print.  The soundtrack is dated, strident, unnatural sounding and very tinny.  It's 2.0 but almost sounding mono in spots while presenting the music at very boisterous listening levels that intrude on an otherwise very subdued audio presentation.  No extras - big surprise.  Columbia's penny pinching started with this release.  You can see where it's lead to by examining my reviews of "The Awful Truth" or "Talk of the Town".  For a studio that entered the DVD race so early on and so prominently, I've little in the way of flattery to offer for its current trend in the digital format! BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BOTHER.
Idle Hands is a gory thriller, about a demonic hand, that attaches itself to various hosts, and at some point figures out how to run amok by itself. I didn't think too much of this movie going in, but by the end I really enjoyed it. I remember this getting slammed with bad critical reviews back when it came out. Easy to see why. Really, the only ones who can appreciate this are stoned teenagers... or the few who can accept what a stoned teen movie should be all about. Things that will make a stoner movie stand out... Like a hot topless chick in KISS makeup, Mr. Magoo cartoons, and the pet cat getting chucked out a window windmill style by its tail. Add 'em up. Then factor in Jessica Alba, who I've gone all these years considering to be a little bit over rated by teen jock types. She is truly amazing in this film. I'd say her best role ever. She doesn't get topless like the KISS chick, but bedazzles the eyes throughout just the same... especially in that Halloween costume!
As with Spielberg's later "A.I." (also generally regarded as a misfire), this is a darker science-fiction fable than you'd expect from the director.  The sense of discovery and wonder is present from start to finish, in images and pictures if not so much in words.  The UFO display lighting up the pitch-black Indiana sky, or soaring over the Devil's Tower, haunted my dreams for years, just from seeing the TV trailers at a young age, long before I'd watched the movie.  From that stand point "Close Encounters" is one of our most enduring films.
The movie serves as a nice in-betweener for the first and third. The epic scale of storytelling is terrific, and this is one zombie saga I'm eager to see go on, especially when part four (Resident Evil: Afterlife) comes out in 2011.
Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union.

The day will come, barring some dramatic catastrophe that destroys human civilization, when we will deliberately alter the human genome to suit or wants, and (we will presume) our needs. It will all start out rather innocently; say pre-birth immunity to certain diseases like Malaria, Alzheimer's, or certain cancers. But eventually designer children will come, and when they do, natural selection will be determined by your birth therapist. This movie is very clever in how it deals with the social aspects of this possible (and perhaps unavoidable) future. As they say in the movie, ` we now have discrimination down to a science'. You can't help but feel for the main character Vincent, who is a `faith birth', because all of us (except perhaps Al Gore) were born naturally, without gene therapy. So we would all face discrimination, which is another interesting point the movie hints at. Who cares about the color of your skin anymore, we're more interested in what your genome looks like.

6263	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	In 2002, audiences and critics alike were surprised by the success of the video game inspired hit "Resident Evil".  Though critics and even some moviegoers didn't feel the movie was worthy of receiving a sequel, even though the ending was left wide open and a sequel was needed for some sort of resolution to the story, the studio execs were clearly listening to those that enjoyed the movie and decided to buck the critics and released "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  The same people that despised the first film were bashing the release of its sequel with just as much passion; however, upon it's release the film managed to silence many of its attackers.  Not settling for merely making a sequel for money alone, writer Paul W. S. Anderson (the writer/director of "Resident Evil") crafted an even bigger, better, and more action packed thriller for the follow-up, and succinctly silenced the nay-sayers with a sequel that ties up all loose ends from the original film, serving as an excellent addition to a budding franchise.

If you need to know a little something before jumping in, it's the story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss) who, after witnessing a series of unexplained bright lights, becomes consumed by an obsession with UFOs that tears his family apart. At the same time, a multinational group of scientists investigating a series of mysterious events begin preparations for the first diplomatic visit from extraterrestrials.

We're not all bad step mothers,  some of us are stepmoms. This movie was very accurate and showed both sides  of the fence. One reviewer said children are not aloud to act this way in  real life, HA. This was a very mild case of what true step families go  through. These childrens lives are being torn apart and they will stop at  nothing to stop their pain. But as the movie shows, it's not because they  are bad, and the stepmom isn't bad for falling in love with their dad, and  once you see through the pain there really can be peace in the end with  true love and understanding. We CAN have a great relationship with one  another . Wonderful show, well worth owning. It truly showed the struggle  real families go through in a fun, humorous and touching way. I took my  stepson to see it. It was our first date. We loved it. He laughed and cried  through the whole show.
loved it
6198	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This is a great sequel to the original. Although it didn't seem as dark and scary as the first, it made up for it in action. The movie picks up where the first one left off. As our heroine has escaped the hospital she finds a devastated world. She must find her only surviving friend and do what she can to bring the Umbrella Corporation down. She finds out more horrible truths about them and is assisted by a unlikely allie. Both movies complement each other nicely. I definitely recommend you add this to your Horror/SciFi collection. A must for anyone that owns "Resident Evil". I am looking forward to the third movie in this set.
What was rather unusual about "Pal Joey" was that it took 15 years to get to the screen, owing to the fact that the play was more cynical, and risqu&eacute;, than was permissible in Hollywood at the time.  And a lot can change in 15 years.  Anyway, the witty screen adaptation, somewhat sanitized, given a Hollywood happy ending, but still sailing pretty close to the wind, was by Dorothy Kingsley, nimble direction was by the under-appreciated George Sidney.
Science and scientists often serve the existing powers. But the level of increasing complexity and advanced technological level are molding a state into the state. The nature of power can acquire hues of major repercussion that we ever know. In this new state of things the law's spirit may become a simple spectator giving unsatisfactory answers and acting with a terrible handicap on its shoulders. There are many ethic and moral abysses that must be discussed and considered, the facts don't let to exist simply because we ignore them. And sooner than later the mankind will have to face this dilemma.

True, the Spice Girls aren't the best actors and the movie is offbeat, but Spiceworld is made to be just fun. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. It's a fictional documentary on the Spice Girls busy lives filled with cameo appearances and outrageous scenes, all for the purpose of fun. I really wish people would give this movie a chance and watch it for what it is.

It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies.

I'm not going to review the movie because the only reason anyone would be interested in this blu ray would be if they already have seen it.  I'm going to recommend trying to find and grabbing a copy based on the transfer and sound.  This thing has never looked this good.  Great care was taken in transferring the picture.  It looks crisp and bright, but not overly that the dark atmosphere is overshadowed.  There's no Predator like DGR in this thing.  There is grain but appropriate grain that helps give the images depth and character.  The sound is stunning.  My speakers were really getting a work out with the mix.  There's sounds that I didn't even ever remember hearing in any other viewing.  The special effects laden finale is a real showcase for the picture and sound.

I already know what all the fans of the movie would say to me. How they don't even want to waste their breath on somebody as ignorant as me or I had to be alive during the times. Well that argument isn't going to hold any water with me. I admit my favorite genre is science fiction but one of my favorite genre's is also drive-in movies of the 50's, 60's and 70's to which this movie belongs along with many Roger Corman movies.  I don't know how much I can say that hasn't already been said both by lovers of the movie and critics. I don't know what the movie critics were thinking. There is no way that today a movie like this would garner positive reviews. Not with the internet being what it is. I suppose many movie critics of the time were part of the hippie generation and were liberal minded. Even so, I don't know how you can possibly think this was a good movie.

While it doesnt hold a candle to the 2nd film, it is only loosely based on the series, whereas Apocalypse will be the winner of the two to big fans of the videogame. The dialogue has its numbing moments, and yes, it could have been a lot more, but it still had a more cohesive feel than any of the videogame inspired crap from Uwe Boll. I wouldnt OWN it, but I would (and did) rent it in succession with the other two Resident Evil movies, and taken as the sum of the parts, it ain't bad.
6791	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here except
This movie portrays mid-70's NYC to a T. The hookers, pimps, pushers, they're all here, and they're all chipping away at Travis Bickle's sanity (what little he has left, anyway).
So yes, as much as this positions itself as the intellectual counterpart to Star Wars, it's still not as tightly written as many other movies out there. That's all right. It's more an artistic romantic vision than an intellectual examination. This is a man's fantasy about escape. He has women to care for the various aspects of his life, he has the freedom to escape, and he goes. He throws caution to the wind and hops on that space-schooner into the unknown. It gets kudos for its portrayal of that simple desire to head off towards the horizon, and its presentation of aliens as a pleasant rather than dangerous force.
But every time the urge comes to do just that I remember an interview with Peter Fonda where he said the key to the movie (my words probably) was a scene near the end when they're kicking back having accomplished all they set out to do & sitting on the precipice of the future; thinking back on the adventure, Captain America couldn't help but think he missed something;  'we f*@!ed up', he said to Billy his faithful companion, shortly before they rode off into the sunset.
Sometime after the incident, we find Alice (Milla Jovavich; The Fifth Element, Faces in the Crowd, Ultraviolet) with amnesia, leaving her memory as bare as her breasts.  Awakening naked in the shower in a lavish mansion, she has no idea who she is or how she got there.  She is taken by force by some sort of black ops team who expect her to remember much more than she does, and then things get interesting.
A chance encounter with Iris (Foster) a child prostitute, increases Travis' sense that he must do something about the city. He wavers between taking action against the man in control of Betsy, politician Charles Palantine for whom Betsy is a campaign worker and the man in control of Iris, Sport (Keitel) her pimp.
Uma Thurman plays Ethans love interest, and they fell in love offscreen during the filming. If you tell yourself to forget that their marriage didn't last, its pretty cute to see them onscreen together. Taking third billing is Jude Law, very well-cast as a genetically perfect man. While his part of the story is pretty sad, he gives a very powerful and memorable performance. If youve never seen him in a movie or don't usually like him, this is a great one to watch.

First the good: the first fifteen minutes were excellent. Great tension, great screenplay, excellent action. (Especially the scene where they are trapped in the elevator). The movie went down hill from there, into some campy zombie-killing thriller featuring an impractically clad heroine, and dozens of super-model looking commandos. sorry, I had to pass on finishing this, about the time the woman woke up in the mansion, my brain began to go numb. Perhaps the sequel will be better? But then again, considering the success of past video-game based films, perhaps not...
Special Feature: The Production [25:00] Oliver Stone describes writing with a sense of anger and urgency. Alan Parker explains how he got attached to the project, scouting locations, shooting in Malta, and working with John Hurt.
The crisis that propels the film to its conclusion is a murder at the aeronautics company that brings in the police.  By a fluke of fate, Vincent's younger (and supposedly genetically superior) brother is assigned to work the case with an older officer played by Alan Arkin.  Vincent's brother eventually works out who "Jerome" really is.  The confrontation between the two, and the younger brother's incredulous disbelief that Vincent has performed such high-level work with such inferior DNA, is sad and gripping.

I reccommend seeing this movie if you love to be scared, but I suggest seeing it when you're not alone, or else during the day.
It's best not to think too strongly about the feasibility of the plot or the action but simply sit back and enjoy the violence, action, and heroics.  There's plenty of violence of both the good and bad kind as most of the  Secret Service is picked off one by one, some of the staff get killed and a couple throw themselves in front of bullets meant for the President.  There's a bit of quibbling going on as the people back in Washington argue over who's now in charge, some wanting to shoot the plane out of the sky, others wanting to wait and see before acting.

If you have the time and the inclination, I recommend that you go to your local video store and rent this sweet tale of a collection of courteous naives whose criminality can't quite free itself from the rules and conventions that govern good humor and civility.
Highly recommended, insanely entertaining.  Yes, Susan Sarandon does walk away with the movie.  But that's not to discount the performances of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris, and of the children, Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, and in a smaller role, Lynn Whitfield as the oncologist.

This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.

I found the element of amnesia of one of the main charakters (Alice) interesting. Though this element has been used many times in other movies it nevertheless keeps the movie interesting, as Alice tries to find out who she is, what she did in the past and why she did it.
Well now I do not want to mix media with a review that is for the movie however a later contribution with the advent of Blu-ray is the two DVD "30th Anniversary Ultimate" editions which seems to have picked up some original material missing from all the tapes. Again I am not trying to distract from the movie content but this edition show that (probably due to this being a movie from the pre-blu-ray era) some scenes are clear and almost three dimensional while others are very grainy and of poor focus. Once you get into the story this distraction will go away.

Bottom line is if you aren't genetically correct, the movie may scare you.
Along the way you meet the not-so-in-distress damsels (Mercedes Ruehl won an Oscar for best supporting actress; Amanda Plummer, who deserved one as well), the company of knights-errant (the homeless of New York City), an evil Red Knight, two even more evil local toughs, and the false-prophets from the land of television.  Each of these is a person, or a type, from our own world.  They also happen to fit the tales of the Holy Grail rather well.  Forced comparisons?  I leave that to the individual viewer to decide, but I found the characterizations marvelous.  This is not a film about Real Life, but it is a film about something truer, something closer to the soul.
7410	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This movie is an outstanding example of Robert Redford's excellent skills and techniques in storytelling of drama.

  I suppose it depends on your sense of humor. If you have a deep, layered, and intricate sense of humor, you will find Mony Python funny (and no, I am not kidding). If your sense of humor is less developed, more of a crudely constructed singular grasp of what 'humor' is, chances are you will not find Monty Python funny. Or, I may just not know what the hell I'm talking about.
The movie definitely evokes the same mood that the Original Night of the Living Dead did.  "It's us versus them and we gotta get outta here."  A Definite recommend.

Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious, heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.
For some reason this film triggers some sort of menu glitch in my Sony blu ray player, but I've confirmed that the problem lies with the player itself and not the disc.
PLOT:
We are certainly in for tonnes of surprises. The action is blasting and will grab you when you least expect it and the visual effects are a treat to the eye. The story is weak, but the action delivers plenty of goods and it the films makes darn sure that you and your head won't be turning away from the screen to go to sleep. Harrison Ford is good, but, surprisingly, it's Glenn Close who plays Vice President Kathryn Bennett that really steals the show. Sure, Harrison takes all the action, but Glenn is more powerful. The cheesy lines such as "Get off my plane!" and some silly sequences don't do the film any good. But, it's got plenty of eye-candy and goodness about it with the thrills and most of the performances, so don't worry too much.
3809	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This still rates as one of Spielberg's best films. Richard Dreyfuss is at his best here as a man being drawn toward the unknown. The special effects were top notch for their day and still hold up well. There are scenes in this movie, such as the scene in which Dreyfuss is in his car and the UFO lights up his car and the mailboxes are rattling, that just knock you on your a## in suspense. The film is directed beautifully and the story told dramatically. This film is a masterpiece in film history and always will be. Spielberg was hitting his stride at this point, Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters, E.T. are all great films in their own right. Despite the fact that Spielberg still makes great films this was the time when he really soared.

The problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).

They take them downstairs. They see the Umbrella rooms and the underground Umbrella Train.
The movie is very well done. It isn't a gore fest, so it doesn't seem over the top. It is well directed and the special effects are very good. If you like zombie movies, or the game series then you should like this movie very much. That is unless you expect this to be the first game in movie form. Think outside your shallow viewpoint and your sure to enjoy a little side story you probably will never see in the game franchise.

Like Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, their follow-up films, Bottle Rocket is a wonderful mix of deranged humour and quiet sadness.

9036	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This movie is meant to make fun of the legends of King Arthur and the Holy Grail, and has proven to be wildly popular.  But be warned...this is not nice family entertainment.  Indeed, it shows the Middle Ages as ugly, filthy, and gruesome.  There is violent bloodshed and people dying of plagues.  Indeed, perhaps the funniest line is how one peasant can recognize the king: "He doesn't have [excrement] all over him!"

And speaking of the characters, why does Michelle Rodriguez think she can act? I mean she does nothing other than spending the entire movie looking angry and [mad]at the camera that she becomes incredibly annoying halfway through. And she seems to play the same annoying character in all her movies; just watch "The Fast and the Furious". It was a great pleasure seeing her changed into a zombie at the end, at least we can all hope she will not be in the sequel.

Gattaca is one of the most thoughful movies I've ever seen.
The genius of this movie is that we don't find out until the end whether the aliens are hostile or not.
This movie isn't actually about punk. Punk is the vehicle they use to carry the plot. If someone were so inclined, they could change it to any "extreme" subculture and still have it be meaningful. It could be about people who are huge fans of black metal and still have the same basic story beats.
It may be somewhat different than the video games but the storyline in the movie was put together very nicely. Definitely a change in pace from the first movie whereas almost everybody dies and now most of them survive. Yet, don't get me wrong. Not everyone makes it out alive or is able to resist the T-virus mutation.

3167	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Easy Rider is definitely a movie for its period. There's no doubt that the film was a free-wheeling, pot-smoking, and other illicit drug type of movie that reflects the period that was - the counter-culture, anti-Vietnam War, and anti-establishment 1960s that came from the age of baby boomers. Peter Fonda's "everything goes" production was effective in producing a spontaneous film that has allowed continued analysis by scholars and anyone interested in the tumultuous period that was.
"Hell In The Pacific" is an exceptional film. It's a pity that we don't get any sort of surround mix for the sound (it could be that the 2.0 mix is the only remaining version of the soundtrack). I would give this 4 1/2 stars for the alternate ending version and 4 stars for the original theatrical version.

It is Dignan who acts as the impetus for what is going to go down: a youthful crime operation is to be formed, with the sole intent of proving to the local crime boss (James Caan, in a role that's probably too small; still, Caan, in his brief scenes, shines) that they are ready to jump to the big leagues.  Only they aren't.  And probably never will be.  This is where most of the film's broad comedy comes from: watching Dignan and his boys try their best, and constantly fail through misguided attempts, to become real thieves (at one point they rob Anthony's house, just for practice).

5608	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowall and Chris Sarandon starred in this hilarious film about the film star "Peter Vincent, The Great Vampire Killer" (McDowall) and his young fan Charlie (Ragsdale) and their fight to save Charlie's girlfriend from a real life vampire, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon).  Peter Vincent is supposed to be the hero of countless "Hammer Film" type movies and the host of the evening television show, "Fright Night".  When Charlie goes to Peter to tell him the man who has moved in next door is a vampire, Peter naturally doesn't believe him.  Charlie persists and Peter finally goes to the vampire's home with Charlie and his friends to prove to Charlie that Jerry Dandridge is not a vampire.  While there, Peter accidentally learns that Jerry is the real thing.  Although he is terrified, Peter ultimately comes through for Charlie and saves the day.  A good comedy with some great special effects . . . it's a keeper.

The only good thing that came out of this was that Jack Nicholson got himself recognized. The only decent actor in the movie.

This is a wonderful film, one that dances back and forth in time, that does an unusually good job at translating a complex and convoluted story to the screen quite magically, and one that is not only plausible but also breath-taking in its import and seriousness.

If you love British mysteries and love British character actors, you absolutely have to own Rumpole. These are all thoughtful, insightful, funny and wonderful shows--following the cozy legal adventures of a dumpy, homely, eccentric barrister who doggedly fights for the little guy. Rumpole never prosecutes, only defends. Surrounding him is bevy of equally eccentric supporting characters. Leo McKern (best known for The Prisoner and the Beatles' 2nd flick Help!) is brilliant as Horace Rumpole, the Wordsworth-spouting barrister. It's a joy to see him grow older as he takes the character from middle-age to near-retirement. I almost cried the day I heard that McKern died. For sure, no more Rumpole. I almost felt the same way when Rumpole's creator John Mortimer (dad of Emily Mortimer) died. But we have these 40 or so shows spanning a decade and a half. And that's a gift.

While "Annie" may not be as well-known for younger audiences of today or even young adults of today, "Annie" was one of those feel-good, rags-to-riches story featuring memorable music and at the time, a commanding performance by wonderful talents such as Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters but also from Albert Finney and Tim Curry.  But the film's true talents were young Aileen Quinn and the magnificent song and dance performances by Ann Reinking.
The dialogue and acting suffer from the made-for-TV feel, and the plot comes across as something closer to one of Reader's Digests' "Drama in Real Life" instead of Krakauer's prose.  Sure there are a few emotional moments and points where they "get it right," but they are too few and far between.  The movie is so rushed we don't have time to care about the characters presented.  Ironically I thought Imax's "Everest," even with its documentary feel, was far more moving.

Sure, it has the reputation of being a bad film, but it's bad in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way. Ah-nold's physical presence and delightfully deep-toned & accented banter really adds a great deal of... um... well, pretty much the same things to this flick as it has all the other actioners he's ever been in. And, like other flicks that feature a prepubescent kid, budding thespian Austin O'Brien gives this baby that tried-and-true aw-shucks-isn't-he-just-keeyoot factor that adds to both the hokey fun AND the nausea! The on-screen chemistry between him and Arnold is part 'Laurel & Hardy', and part Riggs-and-Murtaugh. Well, actually it's more part Abbott & Costello, and part 'Tango & Cash'... um, no that's not quite right, either.

 The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust....

2. He goes and kills those guys and he's declared a hero without going to jail? Was that how it is back then? You go out and you kill bad guys and you not only DON'T go to jail....but treated as a hero? Doesn't make much sense to me, either that or times sure have changed. What he did was basically premeditated murder or mass murder.
Gattaca is fast paced, well written, superbly acted and is a great commentary on where our world may be heading.

The only character that was marginally believable was Sarandon's as a mother battling the fears of losing her children to the trophy wife. The rest of the characters were very uninteresting. I think the screenwriter and director should have done better step-parenting research.

Even more unusual is the father who was more than ready to move on with business related stuff.  The oldest son -who was standing directly beside his younger brother in that crowded area during the kidnapping- was reacting even more unusually by not showing even the least bit of concern (as evident by the way he was playing his Game Boy at the breakfast table and showing signs of happiness or rather expressing feelings that "It's no big deal").  This is more the result of bad writing I believe.  The kid probably should have felt *somewhat* responsible for his brothers disappearance despite his young age.  We *do* find out later he was more than old enough to understand what he'd done wrong however.  Of course it could be argued that what Michelle did was wrong too- leaving two young boys alone for a moment and not being confident enough to know exactly where they were standing amongst the chaotic crowd.  That's not a smart parenting decision.  Then again, leaving kids alone and assuming no harm will be done is a common feeling among many people so I can't really blame her there.
The soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.
Captain America (Fonda) and his buddy (Hopper, playing a paranoid Billy) set out on long, loud, flashy motorcycles, heading across the heartland of the US. Along the way, they pick up a drunk (Nicholson) in a small town and turn him on to, well, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

The main character, Alice, arrives in the movie just like a video game character: No weapons, no clothes, no memory, just a heightened perception and a suite of deadly combat abilities. In order to work out her own situation and objectives, she must collect weapons and useful items along the way, and rely on her observations and on the exposition provided by others (as in a game's cutscene). That exposition, furthermore, is provided in a deliriously perfunctory scene executed as efficiently as a military operation, as if the filmmakers acknowledged the unfortunate necessity of this action-halting story element and decided to get it over with as quickly as possible.
1059	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I am surprised that this movie is not more well known. I just happened to borrow a copy on VHS from my aunt, and the movie simply blew my mind. It shows another side of WW2 and really blasts apart the stereotypes of the Japanese soldier portrayed in American propaganda films and also the American soldier as many Japanese were led to believe. The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy, a Japanese soldier. Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another. They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand. Finally, they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together. They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island. The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch, the only complaint I have was the original ending, but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings. I was also pleasantly surprised that John Boorman directed this film. SEE THIS MOVIE!
As much as I adore Perry Mason, and I do, I appreciate that Rumpole actually LOSES.  And sometimes, he regrets winning.

Charles Bronson plays a drifter, down on his luck with one marketable talent.  He's a great bare-knuckle fighter who needs to earn a few bucks to live on for a while.  Nothing is ever explained who he really is, or how he became such a good fighter.  His explanation to his new found promoter (played with some flair by James Coburn) is that fighting is something he's doing just for a while.

The spring of 1978 was the season of "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters." My friends and I would debate the qualities of "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters," arguing as to which was the better film. For me, a junior high school lad, the greatest film in history was "Close Encounters."

They are the sons of Reverend Maclean, a rather stiff Presbyterian who loves fly fishing almost as much as he loves God, and who sees God in his Montana rivers and the entire fresh, wholesome region.
If you thought that The Matrix was a mind-crunching look into the future, then Gattaca is something you should definitely give a shot at. Ideally, you should see Gattaca without hearing about the story or reading the reviews, and let the movie hit you with the force of its ideas.

This isn't "Death Wish"-type vengeance. Travis is insane, a villain who doesn't understand the depths of his own madness. While dating political volunteer Betsy, he's so unclear on how to go about it that he takes her to a dirty movie, buys her an album she already owns, then stalks her. He writes a manifesto about the evils of society. He's a war veteran, living an isolated life away from his parents. He's unable to sleep. He sees the world as a sick place, where he's the only normal man left. He's not a hero. He's not a tough guy. He's a basket case.

The film also possess a chugging, screeching metal/electronica score composed by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson. No, I'm not kidding. Shock rocker Marilyn Manson assisted in the creation of the film's score. It's actually quite good, even if the combination of the crunching electronic guitars, pounding drum machines, and heavy gunfire could give you a headache by the end of the film.
Granted, this is dry English humor with a bit of  gratitous violence... so it may not be for everyone... but:
BOTTLE ROCKET's power lies in its characters. They are so quirky, so unique, that they seem unmistakably real, and therefore patently likeable. They are simple people who lead quietly extraordinary and beautiful lives, people who believe in following one's dreams, chasing after true love, being individuals--and all with childlike wonder, innocence, and joie de vivre. In short, they are people of unique and genuine character. They also happen to be hysterically funny. BOTTLE ROCKET, while I would not categorically call it a comedy, is easily one of the funniest movies of the nineties. The brothers Owen and Luke Wilson give laudable (although not flawless) performances as the two principals, and they are supported admirably by some great character actors.
Easy Rider didn't look or sound like any movie made in America up to that point. It was clearly groundbreaking for the film industry, but also had a dramatic effect on society in general, with baby boomers coming of age questioning the values, rules, and policies of the older generation. The movie is still powerful and still resonates as a commentary on a divided America and generational conflict.
From there the Umbrella Commandos head down into a secret facility, "The Hive," dragging along with them Alice and a handcuffed Matt. They also meet yet another amnesiac, Spencer Parks, whom they found upon making their way to the hive. As the movie progresses things start to go wrong when they shut down the RED QUEEN super computer.
Made with shoe-string budget and awful marketing (it was marketed as an Orwellian futuristic film which doesn't do it justice), the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit and how everything becomes possible once we commit our heart and soul with ruthless determination. "You want to do how I did it? I never saved anything for the swim back". Committment, dedication, determination, belief...everything IS possible.

It's based on the 100-year old French play "Cyrano de Bergerac," by Edmond Rostand. And it costars the long-legged blonde Daryl Hannah, makes good use of Shelley Duvall, Fred Willard, and Michael J. Pollard in supporting roles, was directed by the talented Australian Fred Schepisi. It's set, supposedly, in a pretty Oregon skiing town; actually filmed in a pretty Canadian town; the cinematography presents us with many green and charming vistas.


The first thing which struck me was the spontaneity with which Mr. Taylor was shown creating one of his new works.  Standing side-by-side with one of his dancers, the two just ... moved ... and then conjectured about what might go next:  "you could start this way ... and then, maybe ..."  Very interesting.  While there is a generous offering of studio footage, the recurring stereotype of the intensely driven dancemaster imploring his subjects to understand the gravity of his holy creation (you've seen this in movies) does not exist in this film.  No cinematic exaggeration here:  it's just the truest depiction of what happens as dance is created.  In reality, the emotion and interaction between Mr. Taylor and his dancers is often more characteristic of a family than of a teacher/student relationship.

I was REALLY wrong.  Don't get me wrong, because I don't scare easily. This movie was amazing.

Perfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library.

9299	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I know many other reviewers have brought this up, but on a SONY DVD player, during certain scenes, rabbits and subtitles pop up unintentionally. There is a rabbit feature: when a rabbit comes up, you click on it, and it tells you production secrets (it is called "the killer rabbit"). This is great if you like that, but if you're not interested in it, there's no real way around it. Every thirty seconds, you have rabbits popping up, even when you turn them off. This DVD is actually cheaper than the one-disc bare bones edition, yet people have spent more money to get that just so they don't have to deal with these stupid rabbits.
The film screams "1978!", but that's not a big deal. Frankly, it adds to the charm of the film. It has the similar cinematography feel to it as "Saturday Night Fever", which is actually quite appealing to me. There's a lot about this film I like that I can't quite put my finger on, despite the more chilling elements within it.
Set in a small town in Illinois (aka Spielbergville), it tells the story of Roy Neary and his encounter with a UFO.  Roy is trapped in a meaningless job in an unhappy marriage with his unimaginative kids.  Roy and others like him will embark on a quest that will lead them to first contact with aliens (hence the title).  As in many Spielberg films, certain themes and events re-occur, eg. reluctant fathers, abduction of children by supernatural forces, references to world war two and old movies, and a sense of fear and wonder of the unknown.
4143	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoy watching films that have famed actors that have played in films before becoming more famous and this film is a true example of one of those films. The film has a bunch of good laughs (especially by Jackie Gleason and Tom Hanks.) I don't have any problems with the film. But, the topic of having to put one's job on hold, divorce, and having a family member with a severe illness is very stressful. Since the film talks about diabetes, Jackie Gleason had diabetes in real life and didn't take good care of himself. But, I'm not going to go on about that. The film is just nicely done and a good closing film for an iconic figure (Jackie Gleason). The moral that I learned from this hilariously underrated comedy of the 1980s is that even though someone has an important job to do at work, that certain person has to look after members of their own family since that's an important responsibility and Tom Hanks was smart enough to do just that.
Enter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.

From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach.

What's been restored/removed:  1) When Neary is followed by the UFO from his first encounter, the large "shadow" moving over him was removed - it was night-time afterall...  2) The "shower scene" restored for the 'Special Edition' is retained.  3) Roy gathering 'supplies' for his family room sculpture project is restored - including his encounter with the hairdryer wielding Mrs. Harris (Mary Gaffney).  4) When Ronnie Neary leaves for good, the roof-top platform is not seen - (1 of the deleted scenes on disc 2 involves this observatory 'deck')  5) At the end, when Roy Neary walks to his destiny, almost immediately the 'head alien' has her conversation with Francios Truffaut [eliminating the theory that Neary was 'changed into' an alien in preparation for space travel]

7748	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I have tried on more than one occasion to like this movie. It is beautiful to look at of course and worth seeing it just for the scenery.  But, Redford just missed the boat on directing it. It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there.  He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth.  Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is "does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?". This movie does not.

The DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a "making of" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.

What's odd is that neither of them are on horses. In fact, one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats. Thus hilarity ensues.

1677	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	It goes without saying that "Upstairs/Downstairs" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a "Harry Potter" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled "Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson "Miss Marple"s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series.

The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.

If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).

7004	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	To me, "Resident Evil" is a film that delivers intense action as well as cutting-edge special effects from thrilling start to breathtaking finish! I have played all the "Resident Evil" games on PlayStation and I thought that the film version definitely lived up to the games in a big way! "Resident Evil" takes place in a future city called Raccoon City. A lethal virus has been released inside a medical facility building called the Umbrella Corporation, killing everyone in sight and shutting down elevators, etc. The main character is a woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich, "The Fifth Element"), who is teamed up with a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez, "The Fast and The Furious") to find the cause of everything that went on inside the complex...but not before some flesh-eating, virus-infected zombies come chasing after them! And the movie goes on from there. A lot of the credit goes to Screen Gems, part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, for bringing this movie to the big screen. Also to Milla Jovovich for not just her performance, but for her physical abilities as well. I mean, you should have seen Milla fight off those virus-infected canines one-by-one! In fact, Milla kind of reminds you of Angelina Jolie in last year's "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider". And also to Michelle Rodriguez for her outstanding role as Rain, who is part of the commando team and to director Paul Anderson ("Mortal Kombat", "Event Horizon"), he did an outstanding job in directing his second video game adaption since "Mortal Kombat"! With a great soundtrack, excellent supporting cast, and lots of action to boot, "Resident Evil" is the best thrill ride of 2002 by far! I can not wait for the DVD to be released!

A lot of folks complained about the supposed unrealistic nature of this film, but I think we know now that it isn't as unrealistic as we would have hoped. As far as this movie goes, it is a thrill ride that is sort of like Die Hard on Air Force One, with the president playing the John McClane character in place of Mr. Willis. The terrorists are complex in their rationale, but ultimately, like all terrorists, they are evil at heart. Frankly, it's a bit unnerving to watch it all happening on the screen. But unrealistic is not the word to use any more. Sure, parts of it strain credulity, but so does virtually every action adventure film (automatic weapons fire never seems to actually hit the good guys in Rambo, or Mr. Schwarzenneger, or Mr. Willis, for example).

3493	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Like the move but didn't mean to buy it. I had one touch buying set up and accidentally clicked on the wrong key.
  From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah "On Trial" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah's position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, "There's no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb," the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy's diatribe when James loses Rose's inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys "look after" the servants ("I hate to see servants humiliated," says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.
David learns a lot from his parents' marriage and from the other relationships in his life and matures considerably throughout the film. By the end, he's more than just a womanizing, hard-charging prankster ad executive. The ensemble cast (Eva Marie Saint,  Hector Elizondo,  Barry Corbin,  Bess Armstrong,  Sela Ward,) is quite impressive, ensuring that watching this nearly 30 year old film will be an enjoyable experience. However, I had to wince at the hair and make-up and clothing styles of the 80's - did I really wear such huge shoulder pads?  I'm sure I did !

Indeed, it would be hard to find a better looking heroine than Milla J, who established herself as Alice, zombie dispatcher extrordinaire in RE1. This time 'round she has some superhuman powers which I admit, regardless of my earlier comments, do stretch the imagination somewhat. She sure can ride a motorbike, though. Milla/Alice is ably assisted by Carlos (Oded Fehr) a rugged, handsome SWATesque type fellow and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) a svelte, sexy police officer type lassie. Good looking indeed - in a pinch, I'd go with Oded, but I'd be thinking of Sienna. Mike Epps also tags along as a Huggy Bear type character, but he is really only there for comic value and to give the cast some (ahem) diversity.

"Bottle Rocket" grew out of a notion that Anderson and Wilson had that their generation, so long believed to be idle and apathetic, could accomplish great things if they channeled their boundless energy.  The problem being, what did they want to accomplish?  This is no better exemplified than with Dignan.  He is a wonderful creation: a case of arrested development whose actions are completely unexpected.  Sure, you know he's going to screw up somehow, but will it be through his over-extended bravado, or just his general incompetence?  And try as you might, you just can't get a complete read on his personality.  He shows not a whit of self-awareness until the film's final scene, a genuinely surprising moment where he has enough self-awareness for ten men.
In itself an easy enough task, but as his knights scatter across the country, they each become entangled in various perils (Imagine Sir Galahad the Pure being trapped in a castle of virgins who are dying to be spanked).

That's alright because it's still a good date movie if you want to stay home.  My one big quibble is that the special feature section is so minimal.  The studios should really go back and give these classic old movies the proper treatment they deserve.

The capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman.

Richard Dreyfus stars as Ray Neary, a man who  suddeenly begins to have visions and hear voices.  Terri Garr stars as Dreyfus' wife.  Finally, Ray's visions begin to take strange turns, and he ends up constructing a model of Devil's Tower in his living room.  By this time, his wife and children have left him.  Meanwhile, odd occurances are happening all over the world.  A flight of Navy torpedo bombers missing since 1945 suddenly shows up in Mexico in almost brand new condition, and a ship is found in the middle of the Gobi Desert.  The voices finally lead Ray and others to Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  There, a large spaceship lands with people that have been missing for years, including the pilots of the torpedo bombers.

The plot is quite simple: a group of people are inspired by UFOs to meet the aliens who changed their lives. However, the beauty is in how that simple plot is realized in the film. One thing this film gets right is its portrayal of first contact. It's a profound event. The people contacted by the aliens undergo dramatic changes in their lives. This makes the movie all the more emotionally compelling. By the end of the film, you feel like you've gone on an emotional journey as well.

This is such a good movie. Like other screenplays Steve Martin has written, it's based on a classic piece of literature.

The most interesting question of all is, of course, whether she really was "inspired" or not. The French Dauphin (an excellent John Malkovitch) and, even more so, his stately and scheming mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon (an excellent Faye Dunaway) certainly chose to believe so, and it clearly suited their interests. The Catholic Church made her into a Saint, but only in 1920. The French have made her into a national heron and she is now one of the symbols of the Far Right nationalist party in France. Interestingly, some revisionist French historians - but not Luc Besson who did not take this kind of risk - have wondered about who she was exactly and whether she really was "divinely inspired" or not. The starting point here is that it is highly unlikely for this young teen-ager to have really been a little sheperd girl for at least three reasons. She knew how ro ride. She wore armour and seems to have also known how to fight. She also has no problems in making herself understood at Court once she arried at Bourges, at a time where country folk in France spoke a wide range of dialects and languages - as opposed to Court French.

We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.

The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.

6443	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Not too bad for the most part, though the ending is pretty unconvincing. The cynical, distant Nick Nolte goes to NYC after his twin sister (played by Melinda Dillon) there tries to commit suicide. He begins seeing her psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand) and through flashbacks we learn about the demons of his family's past - all of which he's learned to suppress his whole life. Conveniently Nolte's wife (Blythe Danner) takes up with another man while Nolte is falling in love with Streisand; at the end he returns to his wife though he still loves Streisand. Nolte is excellent in his role, and as is often the case when he's on screen, his persona dominates every scene he's in; Streisand is fairly bland in comparison. The movie begins to show its weaknesses after Nolte and Streisand fall in love: where the movie should be exploring their love and "obligations" in a hard, meaningful way, it only goes soft and paisley romantic. Why Nolte goes back to his wife, why she even wants him back, is hardly touched on; instead we get the throwaway lines, "You love her more," says Streisand; "No," replies Nolte, "just longer." Not a whole lot of substance there.
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, as well as those who are looking for a great movie for "family night" - it's one of those movies that the whole family will enjoy.

Even more interesting is the way in which Tom slowly begins to break down. As his resolve begins to fade, he breaks into new emotional ground, letting go of the hardships he has been holding inside all of his life. His family life is revealed in gritty detail, all of which provides reason for the attitudes he holds to presently. And when it comes time for him to break down and face his torments, we believe in his emotion because of his experiences. This is the kind of character we can come to care about deeply, through his many realizations and reawakenings.

Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when "The Avengers" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.

The only thing that puzzles me is why - with all the "Collector's" editions and "Ultimate" editions that have been released over the last few years - they have not included Spielberg's very first UFO film - "Firelight".  Made in 1964 when he was 16 years old, "Firelight" has often been cited by Spielberg as his low-budget ($500) version of Close Encounters.  Most folks have never seen it and I don't believe it's ever been available on video but it would certainly interest die-hard fans of "Close Encounters", as a glimpse into the early inspiration of a great film and the evolution of a great filmmaker.

Actually, I was surprised when I found out this movie was only nominated for one Academy Award (and won 0!). I really feel it should have won for best script, best cimematography, best director, best supporting actor, and best film score (perhaps the finest that Michael Nyman ever created). But with Titanic coming out that year, even the tour-de-force Hamlet was ignored.
Regardless of whether an individual viewer considers "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" to be funny, the movie continues to have a loyal fan base (myself included).  Every time I watch the movie I seem to see something different and enjoy the same jokes over again.

Simply put, this is among the best that Monty Python have done, and after over 30 years, it is still up there with the best comedy on the planet. I loved it back then, and I still love it now. An enduring classic that never bores. Great stuff that definitely needs oxygen and defibrillation units.

The Movie, Street Fighter, House of Dead, Alone in The Dark,Doom... then you will have a worth oscar winner movie, i love the DVD, has a lot of really good material but then if you are looking a rental this a excellent option or even if you are fan of Residen Evil games  you must see it, worth the rental or buy(if you really like it).
6690	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	i'm sorry if my opinion is similar with others because i don't have time to read them i can not read English very well so reading them would take me too much time. (i don't do this [giving stars] since now) i've changed my opinion to this movie. There is someone who has their own belief and way to do things they think they can and must do. All other powerful people doubt and try to stop her but also expect her to do something different, useful and helpful. So it's really a hard work. I don't know why LucBesson think maybe a woman can do this work well, in this circomstances she have to pay high price at last. Maybe He's found a man has always two selves and both are strong. When the second(or actully the first) self let a woman getting pregnant, he's let himself get in troble, he can not just live with the sea and dolphins anymore. Other people maybe are just other people but your child is a part of you and if you choose not to care them, you will get guilty. So to a man other people have the ability to increase his sin. But to a woman, if she's lucky enough if she doesn't need to do things for her country if she's not living in India and some places, she has a chance to be and develop herself all the time. And she can choose to love God. In all places i ever saw God is a He. It's a good news for a woman. The best thing is "he" doesn't tempt you to increase your sin, so he's perfect and good for you. When we can just be ourselves we get some kind of power gradually. We can help ourselves and try to help other people. But we have to be modest to God, otherwise we will loss our powers. I basically like Milla Jovovich and her acting here very much, but it looks sometimes she wants some second level things from God and other people and forgets she deserves (always of course) the first level things, maybe she doesn't feel he is God but feel he is DH sometimes. We know what LB wants to express and it's enough. In The Fifth Element she's just born and now she has her belief and ability, but, still, it's a very difficult road if she don't have BW to help her. But we can not find a perfect man like BW in this world. So we actually need a stronger belief of God, then he will get along with you anytime.

9814	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	When I first stumbled upon this film by accident while channel surfing one day I was immediately struck by how unique it was as I had not seen any sci-fi film that held its premise before.  This premise that we will soon be able to dictate our genes and hence will be able to discriminate on genes was also scary as it is now a clear a present possibility as well.  The deleted scene which showed how using this criteria to decide who gets born and who doesn't would have deprived us of Abraham Lincoln, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein etc was also very powerful and really should have been left in the original film.  This was also the first film that introduced me to Jude Law and it showed me just how good an actor he was even way back then.  Being a fan of noir I couldn't help but feel its influence on this film as well.  This blu-ray version is a real treat for fans as it looks great in 1080p and sounds great in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The special feature documentaries are also decent making this to date the definitive version of a great sci-fi film.

One reviewer complained about how "Film Club" is only funny to people with noses in the air.  Quite the opposite, although only film geeks will get it.  A deserving mocking of both David Fincher's pretentious feature and the rules of Dogme 95 (which has produced some breathtakingly stupid, boring, and cliched movies), this is a stone riot.
The film ends with an amazing sequence of events and actually takes on an epic scope without losing the human element that makes it all so enjoyable.  This DVD release follows the format from the recent "Jaws" disk:  a gorgeous widescreen print, a few deleted scenes, some documentaries.  A handsome release.

My favorite in this movie has to be Chris Sarandon, who plays Jerry Dandridge. He is the vampire, and he is very sexy.  A perfect choice for the role.  I also thought Roddy MacDowell was very good as the fearless vampire killer, in movies, but when it comes to real life he doesn't seem to have much faith.
Finally, there's that ever-so-necessary plot twist at the end of the film which I won't spoil, but feels extremely contrived and implausible. And even if it wasn't so contrived, the revelation ultimately doesn't even amount to much of anything in terms of character or plot development. It's basically just used for a laughably "climactic" scene which is meant to mirror a scene from earlier in the film. It all just ends up feeling cartoony.

1842	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Federico Luppi, the fine actor from Argentina, takes the lead role as Dr. Fuentes.  He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a "liberation priest" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are "informed" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation. A completly enthralling film, in spite of its length, that hits close to the harsh reality of life in Latin America. A beautiful film  that is set to the backdrops of the jungle and it's  relics from the past, as well as present day village life , it is a movie that is visually breathtaking and mentally stimulating. Recommended for those that like movies that carry a political and social commentary. Great stuff, see it before your next vacation to the tropics, so that as the guy from the radio says"and now you know the rest of the story" before you get there.

As funny as the opening credits are, the film matches them. The skits are just off the chart absurd, and all the better for it. The film has penetrated popular imagination to such an extent that people aren't even aware sometimes of the origins of some of the things they hear. For instance, I played an online MMRPG (massively multiplayer role playing game), and in that game there were numerous players who played mages with some permutations of Tim, another named Brave Sir Robin, and one quest in the game was to get a gang of people to kill a tiny white rabbit that was capable of killing dozens of those attacking it. One group of players formed a monarchy called The Knights Who Say Ni. Outside that game, merely mentioning the words "African swallow" can evoke laughter in some quarters.
Great performances by the stars. Peter Fonda was the suave and  mellow side of the youth culture. Decked in a leather jacket emblazoned with an American flag, he was the nave intellectual, trying everything and finding everything to be interesting and acceptable. Dennis Hopper was the movement's unthinking, manic side - just looking for the next high, the next lay, the next thrill. Jack Nicholson was the film's tragic, realistic voice.

- Travis, although seemingly articulate and confident about his emotional convictions in his journal entries, recognizes the impending disintegration of his mental state and decides to seek the advice of his colleague Wizard, in a last ditch effort to make sense of his feelings. Travis's somber desperation is evident in his discussion with Wizard and an attempt is made to address the situation. However, Wizard, who shares none of Travis's chronic isolationism, is unable to offer any helpful words to Travis, who is ultimately frustrated one last time in his final effort to salvage his sanity. In the closing shot of the scene, Travis tries to articulate his inexpressible frustrations, to which Wizard casually replies "you know... you're all right, you're all right". With his last attempt to make a human connection an utter failure, Travis is now locked into his path of destruction, a path that cannot be positively influenced by outside individuals due to his inability to express his feelings. It is a particularly chilling scene, perhaps the definitive example in the film depicting Travis's final fate.

I am always shocked at the family reaction early in the film. It's very intense and well played out. One of the great movies to remember.
The acting in this movie is also really good; Chris Sarandon is smooth and suave as a vampire.  He makes being a creature of the undead look like a lot of fun.  Roddy McDowall is awesome as Peter Vincent (I love the throwback to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price in the character's name); he is dichotomy in his grapples with believing in vampires and faith.  I think this was a bold performance by McDowall.  William Ragsdale did a good job as Charlie.  He looked a bit older than a 17 year old teenager, but then again this type of realism isn't why I am watching Fright Night.  If that was the logic, then Elizabeth Shue was way too hot to be a hooker in Leaving Las Vegas.  Consequently, these are the little persnickety thoughts I place into the box labeled "it is only a movie".  Amanda Bearse was also fine as Amy, being both reserved and sexy.  Stephen Geoffreys was also quite vexing in a jovial sort of way in his performance as Evil Ed.  I also like how Jerry's "roommate" looks like a Xerox of Bill Paxton.  Did anyone else notice that or was it just me?

The hilarity of this film is appreciated best by those of us WITH a solid understanding of British history and the actual legendary accounts of Arthur and his knights in medieval Britan. What makes it so funny is how it spoofs off the often ridiculous excesses of the tales. Knights being so incredibly "chaste" and determined to find the Holy Grail as to ignore a castle stuffed with gorgeous swooning virgins are found all throughout the pages of Malory's "Morte d'Arthur" and the tales of Chretien de Troyes. Read anything about Sir Galahad and you realize how intelligent the comedy is. A few other historical spoofs: seemingly impossible-to-kill knights (the black knight), Lancelot's vigor with his sword getting him into trouble as he valiantly kills scores of people with one stroke, mysterious knights in woods who demand a sacrifice (the knights who say "ni!")... etc...

It is also interesting to note a chilling similarity to "The Manchurian Candidate" in Taxi Driver. Just as we see the Angela Landsbury is the controller of her own son as an assassin through brain washing, we are blinded to the fact that Janet Leigh is Frank Sinatra's operator, (Note the strange conversation in the train car, "Would you like a cigarette?").
Overall, Spiceworld is a funny movie that doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.

Her friend, being scratched by a mutated creature in the Hive, starts to mutate and becomes this huge menace. a project named "NEMESIS". ALICE is taken and placed in the hospital where Umbrella employees can keep an eye on her. Unfortunately for them, The Hive was reopened and all the undead creatures and zombies come out to wreak havoc on RACCOON CITY. ALICE is awakened by one of the "doctors" and soon finds herself above ground trying to find her way out and others that may have survived this nightmare. Meanwhile, RACCOON CITY itself is under Umbrella Control and "fenced off" so to speak. The doctor that came up with the ANTI VIRUS has been secured by Umbrella, but his daughter is still inside the fenced off city that is now becoming a war zone with the undead. He seeks the help of ALICE and a few STARS members, introducing us to the lovely VALENTINE. They seek out to find his daughter, the "host" used to create THE RED QUEEN. When the daughter is recovered, the leader of UMBRELLA at Raccoon City decides ALICE must fight NEMESIS or else. They do fight, but you know who wins. They try and escape in the UMBRELLA helicopter, but it crashes in the bomb blast that destroys the city on the surface. ALICE is presumably killed in the crash, but Dr. ISAACS and his team arrive at the helicopter crash site and take ALICE back to an Umbrella research facility, where, ALICE is cloned and all her memories from the previous ALICE are put in place, once again. She is back to herself once more and looks to wreak havoc on Dr. ISAACS and his team.
In addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in "Upstairs Downstairs," you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the "Upstairs" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the "Downstairs" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.

2234	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	It still never ceases to amaze me how this high-spirited action-packed gem escaped me for all these years. My earliest recollection of this film is when I was still in grammar school catching the trailer's most infamous and notorious Harrison Ford moment when he quotes, "Get off my plane"!. (Priceless) Now, after all of these years have passed I can at least say that this film did not disappoint as the solid acting and fast paced action held my attention throughout the film in it's entirety. Upon viewing this film in the Blu-Ray format it made me regret not seeing it in theaters in a sense. On a more positive note, this blu-ray disc truly utilizes it's full potential of technology; moreover, it's patriotic epic score composed by the one and only Jerry GoldSmith which is also accompanied by a great sounding lossless audio track will really satisfy the home theater buffs. On an even more positive note, I feel this Blu-Ray disc was not far off or short for that in matter in delivering a true realistic theater experience because it was quite superb on many levels. I will elaborate more on these technical specs later but for now I will give a very brief summary here.
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS deals with some very well-executed themes.  They include the concept of life, existing on the planets beyond our Earth and the possibility that some people really are destined to explore life beyond the constraints of the world that we know.  Also, Richard Dreyfuss' character is representative of the dreamer that exists in all of us, before the world shuts down our feelings of possibility.

Constantly dissapointed whenever he believes there to be any goodness left, Travis is a man who decides he's not going to take it anymore. What I find most interesting is his fascination with all that he detests. For instance he is sick of the hookers and pimps smoothering the streets, yet he regularly visits X-rated movies with this child-like naivness. Is he fueling his rage, filling the void of human contact, is this some sort of self loathing punishment or is he the "walking contradiction"?
Overall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details.

Blue Thunder is actually pretty smart, obscured though by how much fun it is.  The first half, before we see the super-copter show its moves, is wonderfully paranoid, with an eerie electronic score and wonderfully spastic camera movements (now ruined in countless episodes of NYPD Blue).  Schieder and Stern develope this great dialog (mostly ad-libbed) that keeps things flowing, Macdowell is great as the evil Colonel and Warren Oates - though underused - is also excellent as Scheider's boss.  The flight-scenes are incredibly choreographed and have yet to be surpassed (after nearly 20 years!?!?).
The message of "Taxi Driver" is that peace comes from strength. It was a popular theme in a number of flicks. Hollywood seemed to fail to grasp some important realities about its marketplace. Time after time, movies that veered away from "touchy feely" liberalism and gave teeth to conservative characters (Eastwood's "Dirty Harry", Bronson, DeNiro, and others) made boffo box office, yet the industry has never come to grips with itself. They return time after time to premises that insult conservative audiences, and wonder why the lines get shorter.

This film isn't what I expected. Initially, it begins on a happy note by showing Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper traveling across America on their motorcycles. There's a feeling of euphoria and freedom as we see beautiful landscapes and people waving to them. They pick up travelers along the way, visit a commune, swim in lakes, camp, and smoke pot.

9808	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This movie could be boiled down to today's ideals, talent = greatness. Two of the main characters who were genetically superior found themselves at a disadvantage according to their superior genes, they didn't want something near as much as Vincent because they were given more and had less to prove... kind of. It's one thing to be a failure, it's another to be a failure with everything going for you.
Another character I feel obliged to mention is 'Mother.' Rather than being the cliche behind the scenes man, he seems to know that things aren't always what they seem; he is open to reason and the finding of the truth; and when he discovers the truth, he tries to save Mrs. Peel, even though he is old and injured. It's also worth mentioning that at one point he refuses to believe that Steed and Peel have simply vanished, and he sends out a rescue party. (The kind, benevolent, open to reason boss, who knows when he has to face the danger. And just the right touch of being fatherly.)

The movie then starts with a dynamic opening sequence inside the hive and does not stop. I was told the first game was set in a mansion. This mansion is just in the flick for all about maybe 5 minutes of screen time, because all the action takes place inside the hive. I was also told that none of the characters in Resident Evil: The Game are in the movie. Milla Jovovich plays an amnesiac named Alice who wakes up inside the mansion not knowing how she got there, of course we find out that she is a commando for the Umbrella Corporation. We then meet a squad of commandos who have a mission to enter the hive and stop the Red Queen. Milla joins them for the ride into the hive.

Much better choice, I think, for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep, no doubt.

Can't wait to see it" It was a big dissapointment when I finaly saw  it. First of all it completely destroyed the brilliant ending of the first  part. I think it should have been better connected instead of just being  explained as a nightmare. The character of Julie James is still pretty  interesting but all of the new characters are pale  in comparison. There  are a lot of really gory sequences, which are fun to look at but there  isn't as much suspense as in the first. The producers just thought  "bloodier equals better" I guess but that just isn't the case.  The ending is a ridiculous repetition of the ending of the first one and I  hope this doesn't mean there's going to be another sequel. If you like  seeing Jennifer Love-Hewitt and a lot of blood then this movie isn't too  bad after all but if you're looking for believeable characters and a clever  story line you're gonna be dissapointed.

I think the movie delivers several powerful messages...one of which someone already mentioned- taking matters into your own hands and doing what you want to change things around you that you don't like-and then also I think it pointed out very blantely how much people put on a front- when really inside there lives are filled with things they hate. I think this was obvious in Travis's life and Iris's life and also probably true of Betsy's life also.
And if I took anything away from the behind-the-scenes special (included on the DVD, an appreciated and lengthy extra) it seemed like the cast and crew really gave this movie 110%.  The kids did most of their own stunts, and the special effects and skydiving scenes were handled by Americans with impressive credits to their name.  The dedication really shows through in the film, definitely a rock-solid, top-rank production all the way through.


Vincent Freeman (Hawke) is an "invalid," conceived without eugenic technology.

It is very accurate and if one reads the gospel along whilst watching the film one will see that they have done a great job. As with any film there are however problems. For instance, the music sounds on the cheap and sometimes the editing feels less then professionally done. Brian Deacon is very good in the role as Jesus and he plays the role with conviction. The ending is not that great and they could have left it out. Even so it was a quite good film. Recommended. 4/5.
The two quickly go back to their old ways. They decide to return to a life of petty thieving and even do dry-runs by "robbing" Anthony's family's home in order to see if they still have their robbing edge. They also decide to take on the strangest heists (from meat packing plants to bookstores). Since neither of them own a car, though, they have to get a driver and they pick Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) simply because ...well ...he has a car. Their first felony occurs at the aforementioned bookstore and they make quick their getaway, leaving town and scurrying across the state. They end up at a motel in the middle of nowheresville and decide to hold up. But the trio quickly turns sour when a pretty young hotel maid name Inez (Lumi Cavazos) catches Anthony's eye. Speaking no English, the Central American goddess fails to realize how messed up yet in love Anthony is with her (partly due to the language barrier and partly do to Anthony's fumbling ways).

Scorsese's version of New York is gritty and realistic. Most of the film is shot at night and we see just how crazy some of the people are.

I was rather surprised. Elmo didn't seem as annoying as he usually is. The movie was fun and though meant for children, contained several points of humor for parents and other adults (the Sesame Street gang is largely a group of Muppets after all). There was a nice moral and the guest peformances of Mandy Patinkin as the evil Huxley and Vanessa Villiams as the Queen of Trash were rather enjoyable and added a touch of class (another Muppet trait) to the movie. I especially liked the breaks in the film by Bert and Ernie that may help ease the youngest child's fears, but also provide some great comic relief for nostalgic adults.

Having stated this, the fidelity of this transfer is outstanding.  Colors are well balanced and bold.  Edge enhancement, pixelization and shimmering are non-existant.

Roy is vindicated at the end of the film in his conviction of the importance of his sighting--an importance which ultimately boils down, it seems to me, as the needed supplement for the limitations in a mechanical approach to communication. The limitations here are very beautifully portrayed in the final sequences by a "musical" conversation with the aliens, based on a five-tone sequence which humans first heard coming from the UFOs in India. Anticipating the importance of making the most of this for future communication, Lacombe makes use of a system for teaching music to the deaf to associate hand signals with the notes, which he teaches to the members of his team on the fly (in a nearly empty university auditorium). The notes were successfully imitated by radio to get in response (through radio telescopes) the coordinates of the mountain; they were also successfully used to initiate a whole musical conversation at the mountain itself (with a man at a keyboard and the mothership responding). But the hand signals were very nearly a case of being dressed up with no place to go. Computers were analyzing said musical conversation as it took place, searching for mathematical patterns (I imagine against a database), which the humans were doing their best to go along with, not by improvising, but by music theory. The computer found a pattern, took over the conversation, but it turned out to be incomplete. The computer could no longer respond to the mothership's prompts. The people were stumped too. (I don't fault Spielberg here for not telling us the formula the computer matched against the music, and why it sounded like music. Ever listen to mathematically generated fractal music? Some of it isn't bad, actually.) The point here was plainly that it was time for face to face contact. Lacombe was ready with his hand signals, but the aliens weren't too interested in them. They come out of the ship just romping and playing; they were looking for Roy. (An alien eventually does use the signals to wave goodbye--or was it hello / see you later?--to Lacombe, who had before waved his arms in exasperation when the aliens delayed responding to the musical tones.) To me explicitly having the theme of body language in the film made perfect sense. While you can't paint a real smile, you can study the difference between a real one and a posed one: they actually involve different facial muscles, even different neurological pathways. Neary's participation was necessarily spontaneous, and Lacombe was wise enough to understand its importance even from a more mechanical perspective: In its scientific defense, he refers to it as a "sociological event." To put it another way: Lacombe was "left-brained," Neary was "right-brained," and the two approaches come together in the end to make a fully-blown encounter of the "third kind" with aliens who are "whole brained."

"Resident Evil" begins with a paramilitary commando team invading a house that appears to be mostly vacant except for a strange woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Upon further searching of the grounds, it appears that all is not as it seems, and that this house is really a cover for a secret underground facility set up by the evil Umbrella Corporation.  Though Alice doesn't recall what has happened in the recent days, except for the bits and pieces she receives via flashbacks, she quickly begins to understand that there is definitely something awry with this facility.  A fact that is proven to be correct by the existence of zombies that have begun hunting the paramilitary team.  As if the zombies weren't enough to contend with, it seems that the facility's defense mechanism has been activated and the facility itself is hunting the commandos.  Now, all are in a race for their lives to escape the facility without letting any of the zombies make it to the surface.
If you're going to like this movie, you'll know it from the opening sequence: silence up to a diesel's rumble & whistle on the way into New Orleans; imagery to match.
You'll laugh, you'll cry, and if you're thoughtful, you'll be thoroughly moved by this amazing piece of film. Don't listen to the few negative reviews about this film. How can anyone not see the beauty of this story. It's one of the most surreal, uncynical films about THE POWER OF LOVE to ever hit the silver screen. Big budget Hollywood films like this are a rarity. SEE IT NOW and you'll be singing, "I like New York in June, how about you? I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?" It's a CLASSIC that belongs in your collection. I know it belongs in mine.
Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.

With its witty script, wonderful story and engaging characters, "Steel Magnolias" is a very entertaining and emotional film.  Julia Roberts received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but disappointingly, Sally Field was not nominated for Best Actress for her exceptional performance, especially during the very emotional funeral scene.  Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine and Daryl Hannah performed superbly in their roles, and Dolly Parton was very well casted for her role as Truvy and did an excellent job.  Memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes at Truvy's beauty salon, Shelby's wedding, the Christmas fair, Shelby revealing her pregnancy, other scenes at Truvy's, Annelle's wedding shower, M'Lynn at the hospital, the funeral scene and the closing Easter scenes.  Overall, I rate "Steel Magnolias" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it on widescreen DVD.

Now that I'm older (and hopefully wiser) I've come to respect and admire nuance and substance.  Having recently caught this 1977 feature film again (thank you, cable), I was, simply, impressed.  Very impressed.  This story of a sudden onslaught of UFO sightings, and subsequent 'close encounters' of a select few (who then became obsessed wanting to know the answers to unknown questions) is as compelling and believable as it is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Now it makes sense to me how Dreyfuss's character indirectly goes off his rocker and embarks on some really bizarre behaviour.  (The scene depicting him yanking his shrubs out of the ground and hurling them through the windows of his home while his terrified family look on had me in stitches.)  An alien encounter at a rural home where a horrified young mother (Melinda Dillon) watches appliances from her vacuum to her dishwasher come on by themselves--screws from a floor vent magically unscrewing themselves out of the floor--is jarring and indeed frightening.  Spielberg's story then rushes breathlessly to Devil's Tower, Wyoming, where (under the guise of a chemical contamination to empty the local population) swarthy G-men prepare for a very special visitor--and a select few of those who are touched by alien contact enter onstage, too.

Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones commentary  the American voice and the British voice  Terry Jones dressed as a woman (?), changing into his cow costume, Gilliam would change into womens clothing (the two don't seem to be in the same room at the same time); ast least thats the scene that they set, and well have to take their words for it. Fun with subtitles and titles the first time they showed it to audiences they couldn't believe it; the cheapskate opening captions also happened because theyd run out of money and needed to eat up time. By maintaining a very low production standard, you can get away with murder; its always dangerous when you try to make good proper films, and you cant really do these kind of jokes, says Gilliam, who by now has worked with large budgets. Costume and setting is 14th century, but Arthurian legends are told in the 14th century about the 10th century. In the opening castle scene youd find one of the busiest traffic spots in London, in Hamstead Heath, directly behind the camera, Terry Gilliam acts as Patsy. All castles in the film are Dune Castle, from different angles. They question the authenticity of having everyone filthy with missing teeth, etc. Lack of close-ups, filming too fast, too primitively, too ambitious to have too many gags in it. Watery tart scene written by all Monty Python members. Black Knight scene shot in Epping Forest. John Cleese (Black Knight) and Terry Gilliam (Green Knight) learned sword fighting for this scene. Took a week to shoot the scene, with no budget. The scene didn't work when edited, so they spliced in scenes of John/Black Knight not speaking and it was fine. Tried dubbing the Black Knight lines with other voices. In New York at the opening, the Vietnam war was on, people were anti-war, didn't find it funny. Hired a one-legged man to do the final leg of the Black Knight. The last leg goes off a puppet. First head-banging monk is Neil Innes. Always obsessed with monks and flagellation and self-abuse. The witch is played by Connie Booth, John Cleeses wife at the time. Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film is said to be Tom (actually, William) Palin. Neil Innes was the seventh Python. The photo of God was WG Grace, one of Britains most famous cricketers. John Belushi and Gilda Radner were at the New York opening and introduced themselves to Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones talks about putting the script together. Terry Gilliam talks about how Monty Python came together. At the BBC, once a show was green-lighted, the cast were left to their own devices. But after four episodes they were almost cancelled, because the execs didn't understand the weird humour, but by that time it was too late  critics and fans loved them! Terry Jones talks about horrendous meetings that they would have trying to decide what to call the troupe and their show. The Horses Spoon and a Basin, Owl Stretching Time, The Toad Elevating Moment, and they settled on Bun Whacket Buzzet Stubble and Boot. The BBC said No, this is stupid, you cant name it something like that. They had a working title Circus, Eric Idle suggested Gwen Dibbleys Flying Circus. Maybe our whole show should be like Terrys animations! Terry Gilliam is the blind soothsayer lunatic who cackles. The Knights who say Ni was always the funniest scene when they discussed and rehearsed it, but they had trouble filming it. George Harrison said that Monty Python were the spirit of the Beatles continuing, since they started the year the Beatles stopped. No ad-libbing, all scripted and rehearsed, so they could shoot quickly (later Eric Idle mentions that he ad-libbed one line into the Bring out your dead scene). Terry Gilliam talks about the difficulty of co-directing, having been a secluded animator, and how Terry Jones launched a re-think of knights roles in society from gentlemen to mercenaries, showing how castles had sealed interiors to protect the inhabitants from their knights (why would that be needed if knights were gentlemen and not scoundrels?). The Tim the Enchanter scene in a quarry in Scotland, great light and sky. The Bridge of Death scene was one of the first shot. Shortened the ending tremendously, moved on to the end, there was supposed to be more dream-like, floating stuff in the end.

Travis is simultaneously at home in the squalor of his city and violently disgusted by it. Does it change him into something human or something monstrous? There are no easy answers.

Fortunately, the film finds in Harrison Ford the one actor who can fully inhabit two kinds of grandeur -- action-movie bigness and the aura of the presidency.

9403	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Monty Python took a hell of a chance making a full lenght motion picture, as the simple production and mostly strictly six man skits which characterized their TV show and their live performances since 1968 gave their brilliant scripts and acting their full power. With the Flying Circus behind them, however, and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife (Fawlty Towers), Monty Python decided to take that chance, and it proved to be worth it, mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing. However, almost every scene is brilliant by itself, and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.
5212	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	The importance of Taxi Driver cannot be overstated. More than a well made film, the movie is a genuine character study of the highest achievement. The absurdity of the decade in which the film was made lends an incredible amount of reinforcement to the presentation. The "conspicuous consumption" lifestyle of the 1970's makes the cheapness of human life depicted in the film (prostitution, exploitation, violence) seem all the more engaging. A few of the more important, albeit subtle scenes that I feel make the character study so realized include the following (I would ask that any viewer of the film pay close attention to these scenes and try to interpret the subtle importance of them as they relate to the character):

-The soundtrack's commercial songs seem a bit more polished than the first one's.
It's directed by Gary Oldman (known for his acting, or overacting, in Dracula, The Professional etc,) and he proves to be a great director. The movie is about a family with Ray Winstone as Ray, the father/husband of the household and Kathy Burke as Valerie. Ray is a working class lout who abuses both drugs and his wife. His son Billy (played by Charlie Creed-Miles) is a herion addict on the streets after his father nearly bites his nose off for stealing his smack. Ray is at times both scary and pittiful, mean and sad, nasty and pathetic. He intertwines these roles so well that at time's you can't tell where he is coming from, or what he'll do next. Valerie is just a simple wife who is just trying to keep her head down so she doesn't get it taken off. However even she is not imune to Ray's violent temper over nothing. In one very vicious scene she is attacked by Ray and although the beating take's place off-camera it still sends chills.
I found "Touching Evil" to be a fantastic series, so when "TE 2" became available, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, it took me some time to watch all the episodes. Perhaps this was because I was so impressed with the first series that I had high expectations. Maybe it was "sophomore slump." Ah, it was probably that the story arc of the first series was just plain more interesting. It is often the case that when the original creators of a series relinquish creative control to others, the quality suffers. This is also true of "TE 2," which sometimes seems like a pale reflection of the original. What it still has going for it, however, is the characters. I very much appreciate the circularity of the stories, bringing characters--like Creegan's wife and kids--in and out of the story at various points throughout the series. Shaun Dingwall alternately impresses and annoys with his portrayal of the unsteady DI Rivers, and Nicola Walker--another unconventional look but undeniably powerful--just knocks my socks off when she takes Creegan to task every so often. Maybe that's the key to why I enjoy the world of "Touching Evil" so much: It feels like family.
But he's not the one-dimensional freak/weirdo/thug we'd expect just by getting a quick glance at him. He shows compassion and even sweetness at time like all the other characters, even Ray.

This film in particular was a showcase of how good writing can make up for subpar acting.  The actors in this movie were not great, but the story, the words, they were fantastic.  Basically, a guy gets bored with life and wants some adventure and he drags his buddies along as he attempts to become a criminal. Things don't go as planned, but the results are very funny.


This film has everything the original had (including... Jennifer Love Hewitt!!!) and even more. There are more killings, more plot facets (they add in the trip to the Bahamas, Nancy, who is a rather good character, the deal with the voodoo, the storm, and lots of other stuff.) Most sequels are just re-hashings of the first film, just with more blood. But instead, this film had plot as well, and wasn't just pointless killing.

7686	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	The movie is well done and captures your attention, assuming you have the capacity to enjoy this type of movie. The movie is about a minister and his family, narrated by the older son. It portrays a more realistic view of the lives of a religious family in American. In contrast to how religious people are portrayed by the media, sorry I had to add that observation. I see some reviews that focus on the two rebellious sons. I was in a Pentecostal church for five years and I can say that this movie does a good job of showing how different the kids are from the parents, which are very religious. The movie does well in showing how committed the parents can be while their kids are not that committed. I saw this first hand. The parents never stop praying and focusing on their kids, they love them with all their hearts, I've seen this. Although the sons are not really rebellious but have such strong family support that they have the confidence to take their individual talents to the limits. This movie shows that strong family units make strong and talented and healthy individuals. Athough many people have problems as the younger son had with gambling.

7611	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	When this movie came out, it was considered a pretty good version of Annie. It captured the original feel of the play. Most of the principles were well-played. They did mess around with the original play, deleting certain songs and adding others. Finney plays a gruff Warbucks. Love his acting. His singing isn't quite as good. Annie is perhaps a bit too bubbly to be believable--comes across as trying to be Shirley Temple--but she sings pretty well and this being based on a cartoon allows one to forgive a little emoting. I love the villains. Carol Burnett does her famous drunk shtick throughout most of it, but it makes sense that the kids drive her to drink. I did not care for her supposed redemption at the end of the movie. It would be better to see Mrs. Hannigan get her upcommance.

I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.
Though the movie does tend to seperate itself from the orignal video game some, the basic elements are still the same.  Zombies, killer dogs, mutant killers, and a nasty virus that can destroy mankind as we know it.
I hearby call on Sony/Columbia Tri-Star to give us this title as Europe and Australia have. Thank goodness I have a region free DVD player. I have the R2 version of the movie. Looks sharp.
It does not necessarily have a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one. I will be sure to watch this series again and again. I think it gives a good insight into the history of the time as well as telling an enduring story. It shows the decline of the noble class in England, how it began and came about. That was a little sad to me because I think we lost something of elegance and grace along the way to progress, and I could not help feeling that I wished we had at least some of it back. All in all, this is a very good series. I wish there had been more of it. I would have liked to seen what happened to the characters during the Great Depression.

We actually met the American couple doing work along the Amazon River. Before becoming an Adventist myself about 15 years ago, I had never even heard of Seventh-day Adventists. Even today, many other denominations are still confused about who Adventists are, even though the Kelloggs cereal company was started by Adventists as part of their medical/health evangelism. Don't take others people's word for it, check them out for yourselves, Adventists are in more parts of the world, have more schools, more hospitals, than any other Protestant denomination. Are some of their doctrines unique? Yes, but most assuredly they are Biblical. I personally had read the Bible through many times and wondered where the churches were that preached the Bible as written before I became an Adventist. Adventists are not "New Testament" Christians they are "Bible" Christians. The video does a great job of bringing out the medical-missionary work.

The film ends with Bickle meeting Betsy one more time as he is driving her home in his cab (by a chance meeting).

With classic comedy scenes aplenty - you must have seen the Black Knight scene surely? - that still are as funny today as they were twenty five odd years ago, this is truly a gem of a film. What this bunch of comic geniuses managed to achieve on a shoestring budget remains one of the pre-eminent comedy classics, ranking up there with the likes of Buster Keaton's The General. Okay, it looks cheap and nasty at times, but you really would be hard-pressed to make any complaint - there are plenty of way over-budget Hollywood pieces of tripe that could not even approach the delights of this film with one hundred times the budget.

7594	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	EYES OF LAURA MARS is an interesting movie to me. It was released to theatres during the peak of the disco era (1978), and featured Faye Dunaway (Bonnie And Clyde, Network, Three Days Of The Condor) as maverick fashion photographer, Laura Mars. Then, there's Tommy Lee Jones (Executioner's Song, Double Jeopardy) as Lt. John Neville. Rene Auberjonois is Laura's agent. Brad Dourif (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Child's Play, etc.) plays Laura's driver. If that's not enough, Raoul Julia (Addams Family) is Laura's slithery ex-husband! The script was written by none other than horror meister John "Halloween" Carpenter! The theme song is sung by Barbra Streisand herself! This all sounds odd, yet it all works together to make a decent little thriller. EoLM has re-watchability going for it as well.

On top of that you may notice that this movie "samples"  ideas from other movies such as Andromeda Strain - compare the Hive to Andromeds's underground installation as well as the Hive's computer system to the automatic self-destruct mechanism in Andromeda Stain.

Another steal was from Night Of The Living Dead where dead bodies are hijacked and commissioned to wreak havoc on the living.
Sure enough, upon watching I found Fright Night replete with the worst of 1980s culture and topped with Cheez Whiz (the nightclub scene was particularly unbearable). Nonetheless, the special effects are both intentionally and unintentionally humorous, the story mildly creative (although predictable), and the 106 minutes not wasted. Stephen Geoffreys as "Evil Ed" was so over the top that he actually was a pleasure to watch, inciting laughter despite what passes as funny in the 21st century. And honestly, the special effects are still commendable for a pre-CGI world, right down to the uncomfortable custom contact lenses made for the vamped out actors. Considering that vampire films need to be graded on a curve, Fright Night remains a work worth watching, if only for some laughs.

This character-driven piece about a young man born as nature intended living in a world with people who have been engineered by science is simply amazing. It's warnings against tampering with the ability of nature to perfect humans without human help is something to think about. The futuristic settings and environment were a believable addition to the plot. I couldn't stop looking at Uma Thurman's gorgeous lips in every scene she was in, and the youthful, handsomeness of the leading men made the movie a delicious tale of what can go wrong when we allow science to manipulate us into seeming perfection.

Columbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.  I think Columbia would do wise to just hand over their film library to more capable hands to preserve.  Of late their transfers have gotten even worse than this.  However with this DVD release, there was a definite beginning to that end!
Dustin Hoffman is introduced as her conscience in the later half of the movie - and is haunting!  In addition, I believe that this movie does a great job at demonstrating how religion was "Feared" during this period of history!
The first hint of Paul's gambling problems in the police sergeant's comments left me wondering why the story had suddenly become so obvious about where it is going so early.  But fishing hero Paul's tragic flaw is not his gambling, but his belief that by plucking the fish out of the river he will overcome the compelling force of the river's flow.  For a moment I thought he would drown as he caught that fish of fishes, but he surmounts.  That got me hopeful, and I forgot (as apparently Paul had) about the gambling . . . I took my eyes off of the fact that no matter how great the achievement, a river runs through it.  The river as mere water did not swallow him up; but the river as the flow of life, love, and temporality sure did!

It is about a Dj jockey who caused a killing spree and tries to find redemption by helping one of those who was touched by the tragedy.

It also stars Michael Jeter, a homeless cabaret singer, Mercedes Rhuel, and Amanda Plummer. Such a beautiful movie, don't understand how a little amount of people find this film trash, which it's not. It's a simple film about  a dj making mistakes over the radio which triggers a killing spree and trying to fix them by helping someone who was affected by the tragedy. I love this film.

Dignan is in a ridiculous yellow jumpsuit on some sort of rundown moped and is talking to Anthony.  Bob's macho and not-so-nice older brother - Future Man - pulls up in a jeep and mocks Dignan's attire.  After Future Man drives away, Dignan is feeling pretty hurt.  Anthony tries to make him feel better and says something to the effect of, "Come on, man.  Did you see what he was wearing?" (Future man had on a waspy, pastel colored polo shirt.)  Dignan replies under his breath (I didn't even catch the line the first time I saw this movie) and in all seriousness, "Yeah.  It was pretty cool..."  This is the sort of comedy I love.  It's not in-your-face.  It's barely on the radar.  If subtle humor likewise appeals to you, then chances are you will love `Bottle Rocket.'  Worth noting, for those of you who have seen `Royal Tenenbaums' and are expecting something more or less identical - `Bottle Rocket' is in the same vein of comedy - but is definitely more subtle and less "colorful."  I just want to warn you so that your expectations don't cloud your appreciation of this hilarious film.

THE REVIEW
Casting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.

But at it's core, Gattaca is a film with a heart. It has an emotional core to it, a sensitive, at times romantic and sad core. It's ending is both thrilling, intensely touching, and brilliant.

It is a look into the fringe of society at the time of its making yet the film explores themes that are just as relevant today as it was then.  It is much more difficult to be "different" than average.  In a country that consistently preaches how much it values Freedom, people that live free are admonished.  So there is the meaning I took from this film.  The pure entertainment value is awesome as well.

Jeff Bridges is Jack Lucas. A rich radio shock jock who has unwittingly prompted one of his lonely and psychotic listeners to commit a heinous massacre of innocents with a shotgun in a New York cafe. Media attention has caused Jack to become a broke self-loathing alcoholic full of guilt. Robin Williams plays Parry. (Not his real name.) Parry rescues a suicidal Jack from two youths who attempt to burn him alive, believing he's a homeless drunk. Coincidentally, after witnessing the horrifying murder of his fiancee at the hands of the psychotic listener, Parry has become a broken homeless schizophrenic knight-errant in search of the Holy Grail. Is he schizophrenic? It seems God and some small floating fat people are very specific about proving their reality to Parry. They also insist that Jack is the "ONE" who can save Parry from the flaming Red Knight; a presence that symbolizes evil and haunts Parry's every waking nightmare. Parry tells Jack that only HE can defeat the Red Knight by stealing the Holy Grail. Jack starts to believe that maybe God is speaking through Parry, but ultimately remains unconvinced of the truth until Jack forces himself to perform an act of love for Parry. And thus begins Jack's redemption through Parry.

"Men With Guns" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.  This film offers us a tool to raise awareness, and civic groups like Global Exchange and Madre offer us opportunities to act in solidarity with the victims of US foreign policy.


3553	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I saw this movie years ago and still love.  Richard Dreyfuss  is such a great actor,  a lot of his movies I love.  This movie he is with his family when he gets a call from his boss saying that there is a power outage and that he needs to got and fix the problem. He is on his way and gets lost. He stops to look at his map and suddenly things start to happen. His lights turn off and things start to shake.  After he realize what happened, he drives up the road alittle ways and he comes across these people along side the road. They see these objects that have colored lights on them and the police are following them. After the lights disappears the power comes back on. Richard looses his job, but he can't get this picture out of his mind. Things happen all over the world and it take just one man to realize that they were being given directions to a site. Richard and anyone that saw these UFOs would have these pictures in their mind of a mountain. Richard made a mess of his and neighbors yards with trying to build this mountain. He then figures out where this mountain is and plans on going there. In the end he and this lady make it there and what they find out is that the UFO is coming to return the people that they had taken. Richard got picked to go with them in the end. This is a great movie for the family to watch.

9204	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	The English comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin), is widely known for its series of humorous sketch shows, broadcast on television in the early 1970s. Much of their work was a humorous combination of the creative, farcical, and surreal, such that the group's influence on subsequent comedy was significant. In "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", they tried their hand at a feature length film that spoofed the Arthurian legends and the quest for the holy grail, with a parody of the chivalrous knights of medieval tales. Being a fan of the Arthurian legends and of parody, it was this combination that first attracted me to this film, as well as the fact that it is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy films of all time.

The movie presented here looks excellent, in anamorphic wide screen, and includes a commentary by Dennis Hopper.  Also included is a wonderful 'Making of' featurette called Easy Rider:  Shaking the Cage which really helps to illustrate all that went into making this film.  The production, at time, often reflected the turbulent times of when the film was made, and helps to give more flavor to the movie, really enhancing the overall effect.  All in all, Easy Rider is a wonderful slice of outsider Hollywood that captured the true essence of an exceptionally turbulent time in America.
special effects makeup artist Richard edlund is also interviewed which is the Highlight for me
I also enjoyed that the script was not telegraphed. There were many points that I had no idea at all where the story would go - would he do X or Y? I had to sit and wait and see how it all unfolded.
9433	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	If you haven't seen this classic spoof on the middle ages in England, you have missed out. The comedy is fresh and keeps on coming in this classic film from the British comedy group Monty Python. The story has to do with King Arthur finding a few good knights and setting out to find the fabled Holy Grail. There are many memorable parts to this film, and it is still very popular today, with good reason. I often find myself recalling amusing parts from the film, such as the witch scene, the wedding scene, and the killer rabbit and the holy handgrenade, which is my favorite part. The film doesn't go overlong, it stays at a lively 90 minutes, and although it leaves you wanting more, it is not going to take a large chunk out of your day. This movie is not a star vehicle and does not use cursing tirades to achieve comedy. (I don't consider the latter true comedy.) However, the stars of this movie, although they all play triple- and quadruple-roles, are endlessly entertaining. This is most certainly their best film, and it is worth buying because you will want to see it again and again.

But of course if you seen the tv show and wondered what the inside of Oscar's can looks like, then this is the movie to view. Elmo is the little red monster on this street which called Sesame Street where even people also live on it. But it is hard to believe (at least for me) that this show has been on the air since 1969 and usulay shows depening on if you they are a hit or not are on the air for at least 5 or more airs and may run for at least another season. When this movie begins, Elmo (Kevin Clash) is playing with this blanket until his best friend Zoe (Fran Brill) get in a fight with tle blanket and the blanket goes down Oscar's trash can and into Grouchland. And Elmo decides to get into Oscar's (Caroll Spinley who also voices Big Bird) trash can to save his blanket. And when his pals on Sesame Street found out, some go down Oscar's trash can to find Elmo.

However, whereas Sinatra had an entire platoon to back him up when making a tentative truce with the stranded Japanese castaways, in "Hell in the Pacific" there are only two, Lee Marvin and Mifune Toshiro.  Lost on an unpopulated island, the two enemies must first fight, then carve out a grudging respect as they realize the desperateness of their plight, and how little wars mean when there are only two people in existence.

But that's it.  Alice is far too much of a superhero to make us feel concerned about her survival.  There are too many characters to keep track of without enough plot development to care about them (Carlos seems to have no actual value at all, less so than even L.J.'s offensive portrayal as a black gangsta). And for some reason, Alice's every move is punctuated by a whiplash sound that quickly gets tiresome.

Anyway, when the kidnapped son miraculously comes home under the most hard to believe circumstances (he was living 2 blocks away the whole time?) this is when I'm certainly confident in giving this film a solid 5-star rating.  The kidnapped son was the best actor in the entire movie.  Whether it be his reaction to having to move away from the man he once called his father and suddenly having to radically change his lifestyle with his real family (that he barely remembers and therefore feels out of place) or the way his upbeat personality has a knack for bringing out the raw emotions in his older brother and mother, he definitely steals the show here.  No doubt about it.

The film consists of several sub-plots which gradually dovetail together. At the summit: The hero, Roy Neary, and a young boy, Barry Guiler, having kindred spirits, are, so to speak--through many trials and despite themselves--eventually brought together as family, one might even say providentially so. This family is contrasted to some vivid scenes of domestic life lived in narrow and petty way; the new family feels at home with itself while welcoming the most distant strangers: visitors from the stars. This openness is conveyed on the level of a child who is too innocent to even know the difference between an alien and a human; I would say, precisely, that it was Spielberg's main accomplishment in this film to convey it. Here Barry, a toddler, even steals the show--reportedly nicknamed by Spielberg as the "one take" kid! Though outwardly a movie about aliens, the visitors ultimately have, in this sense, the simple role of introducing the boy--and his widowed mom, Jillian--to the man (and very much from the point of view of the kid). It is, as it were, the antithesis of the premise for "Lost in Space," of a family huddled together in an alien and hostile universe. If the child in you is dead, don't waste your time watching this film. If the adult in you is alive, be willing to see the film multiple times. It hangs together very well, but it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it and see why.

One night while watching a vampire flick he notices his new next door neighbors and they seem to be getting rid of a body and becomes very unnerved.

The final conflict of "SLC Punk" comes at a rapid pace, the spiral begun by an impromptu acid trip in a park leading to yet another all-night party and a drug overdose. Stevo doesn't leave the punk scene more than he evolves, as most of us do in life. There's a tendency by hardcore faithful to downgrade this film because Stevo transforms rather than giving the world the finger. He reaches his breaking point, splintering off into his own individualism. It's an oddly touching moment, spiced by an incredible flashback as Stevo takes Rush off the turntable and plays Generation X for the first time. Suddenly, the road becomes clear.

I have friends, who feel that Robin Williams is over-the-top here, and for the first half of the film I understand where they are coming from, but he completely pulls everything in towards the end and fully develops this heartbreaking character.  The way he shifts from crazed lunatic to seemingly stable (the scene where he attempts to mate with Anne) to tragically haunted is just mesmerizing.  Williams certainly has his own comedic style, and some find it blatantly irritating, but he really makes this character his own.  His more emotional and dramatic scenes are simply flawless.  His two big monologues (the `Fisher King' story and his "I love you" scene with Plummer) are two of the films big highlights.  Just as good, if not even better, is Jeff Bridges.  I actually feel that Bridges gives the better performance here because he doesn't have any gimmicks to rely on.  He doesn't have the `crazy' to draw attention his way.  He simply has to construct this man's unrelenting guilt from scratch and convince us that he is emotionally crippled because of his failure as a human being.  He does that effortlessly.
5 Isolated Score Tracks
This DVD package (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in a box, this "Set No 2" color-coded ORANGE) is ONE of FOUR sets for the 1967 episodes. The marketing of "The Avengers" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the "set") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.
The DVD version of Close Encounters contains neither the original version nor the Special Edition.  Instead, DVD owners are treated to the "Directors Cut" that "...can be seen and enjoyed as he has always intended...".  This basically means that the sequence inside the mother ship is cut out (a sequence he never wanted to do anyway) and a few scenes that were included in the original were put back (including a favorite scene of mine of Roy taking plants and fencing from the neighbors to build his mountain).

Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of "John Adams" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject.

"Fright Night," easily has some of the best make up & special effects for any horror film of the 80's, especially a female Vampire with a gaping maw, filled with razor sharp teeth. It helped set a standard for Vampire's appearances to this day. Not just blood shot eyes & fangs, but a metamorphosis, not unlike land mark Werewolf film's, "An American Werewolf in London" & "the Howling. "Fright Night" can make a pretty air tight claim to the Vampire sub-genre, that those films did for the Werewolf sub-genre. It can also stand along with those films as one of the best examples of it's ilk, a modern updating of the Vampire film legacy, even though we have "the Boy Who Cried Wolf" plot, seldom has it been done so convincingly well! Scary, & funny, all at once!
Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it.  Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.


Many critics have lauded Martin's extraordinary gift for physical comedy, but you've got to see it to believe it.  He opens the movie with an energetic strut across town, then has a wonderfully choreographed fight with two rude young male tourists: his tennis racket against their ski poles.  He also spends a lot of time climbing up and around houses and trees; and falls down from a tree, claiming he was abducted by aliens, as per a puzzling scene in the original play.  The movie also gets a gratifying amount of mileage out of  Charlie's fire department: there aren't too many movies that give the viewer any feel for what a character supposedly does to make a living.  One criticism: Dixie is not as young or beautiful as Roxanne, but does that mean she had to be turned into an asexual auntie type? Oh well.  Romantic comedies don't come much better than this.
These days I still get a child-like thrill when watching "Close Encounters." The opening two-thirds of the film are no longer ponderous, but identifiable. The awkward situations of a struggling middle-class family are realistically portrayed. Paul Schrader, noted author of "Taxi Driver" and "Hardcore," wrote the original draft to this film. One suspects the obsessions and frustrations of Richard Dreyfuss' character came from his tortured pen.
5150	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Didn't see this movie back in the 70's, and never intended to until I recognized that a lot of Amazon reviewers compared "One Hour Photo" (a film I thought was excellent) with "Taxi Driver".

9134	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	As we flew in their circus the comic geniuses known as Monty Python brought sketch comedy to a new level before making films. Though they made only four films that would be "official" Monty Python movies (Now for Something Completely Different, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life) they worked together on several other occasions in stage, film, television and even video games. Of all Monty Python works of any kind, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is by far the most quoted and remembered. This does not always mean a film is the best of a series, in fact often it is only the lowest common denominator, but in this case in my humble opinion this is the finest work they ever did. Many people, myself included, needed to see the film several times before catching each line since much of their rhetoric would be delightfully overcast by laughter. And like all great comedies it is best seen with friends. It is truly a gift to enjoy being bathed in the laughter of friends, and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is in this way a truly precious gift.

 The behind the scene commentary was interesting and insightful. Both Dennis Hopper and Fonda offered much discussion about the making of the film that reveals how difficult and how real the actors experienced what was happening in the southern part of the United States during the late '60s, which was much more intense -- bigotry and animosity towards the hippie or "long-haired" culture.
3924	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Admittedly, an engaging, enchanting film.  25 years later the performance of French film director Francois Truffaut as a foreign scientist, Richard Dreyfuss's obsession with mashed potatoes, and the sonic exploration of the octave and its overtones remain nestled in the viewer's subconscious, if not conscious, memory.  But in retrospect this film followed an era in which an idealistic generation, once devoted to social change and the immortalization of its own youth culture, had to settle for the latter of the two possibilities.  The "story" represents not just an escape from the banality of middle-class values but from responsibilities, conflicts, risky human relationships, and life itself.  Another capitalistic commodity pretending to renounce a way of life it in fact promotes and is inextricably bound to, "Close Encounters" is the first of many blockbuster "Third Kind" epics to achieve success on the big screen.  Play it with a good sound system.

Hollywood has a history of interesting director-actor relationships of which the Scorsese/De Niro association is perhaps one of the most remarkable, starting with "Mean Streets", having its climax precisely with "Taxi Driver" only three years later and going on through "Raging Bull", "Goodfellas", "Cape Fear" and "Casino".

There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when "The Avengers" got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time. These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966, (it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series). In the end, '65 and '66 were the two best years of all.

Albert Brooks who makes his film debut here improvised his dialogue as his character wasn't all that fleshed out in the script. He's also quite amusing in a very dark disturbing film. Scorsese makes his debut here as an actor as well when the actor who was originally cast couldn't do the role due to an injury (he appears twice in the film you can also glimpse him sitting on the curb outside the campagin office in the beginning of the film). It's also pretty interesting watching Bickle's reaction to Scorsese's rant and who he considers to be, well, more disturbed than HIM.

7918	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Ever since Robin Williams passing, I have revisited his older, more dramatic, often over looked roles. I have since watched Insomnia, One Hour Photo, What Dreams May Come and I think the strongest of all his dramatic performances, The Fisher King. Much like Jim Carrey, Williams understands the darker side of human emotion, but often times chose more comedic, uplifting roles probably to escape from his personal demons. But never was there a more personal, more touching, more emotionally ravaging performance by Williams than that of Parry in Terry Gilliam's secondary masterpiece to Brazil. I will spare the summary of the films story, as it is described above and if you are here reading reviews I'm sure you have read it. All I really want to say is that you really should purchase this film if you ever were, still are or have recently become a fan of Robin's more dramatic roles. He gets lost in this film, you forget for a while that this is the man who ever donned drag to play a British housekeeper, or created slapstick out of green flying rubber, or outran stampedes of CGI animals. It is absolutely worth the money, and I suggest buying it now.

5573	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Although "Fright Night" is considered to be an 80's classic, it is actually more than that. The film is an endearing and energetic homage to horror cinema especially the Hammer productions and the Universal horror cycle. Yes, the film has a humorous tone, but it is not campy nor is it trashy. It is a competently written, stylishly directed and wonderfully performed horror film which features amazing special effects by Richard Edlund (back when effects depended on imagination, not processor speed) and a truly original and haunting score by Brad Fiedel. But the highlight of this movie has to be Roddy McDowall's performance as Peter Vincent (which is Tom Holland's tribute to actors PETER Cushing and VINCENT Price) as his portrayal of the fading horror star who hosts a second rate late night horror show who reluctantly becomes a real life vampire killer, is both terrific and arguably his career best. With an atmosphere that is nothing short of a horror buff's dream, good performances and a terrific, special-effects laden climax, this is a horror classic that is unmissable for fans of horror and especially vampire films. *The Region 1 dvd features a gorgeous anamorphic transfer, but is sadly missing the 5.1 sound remix that is featured on the region 2 edition, however both features the excellent trailer, which is also restored*.

Non-spoiler synopsis: Travis Bickle (De Niro) is a heavy drinking, pill popping night shift taxi driver living a solitary existence and suffering from insomnia who will drive anyone anywhere. He wears a paratrooper style jacket with a faded "Bickle" on the back. He is not exactly a dullard, but has real trouble properly reading social situations and has a childlike quality about him. When he speaks with 12 year old Iris (Jodi Foster), for example, they interact almost like peers. Travis is clearly unbalanced, but it's not clear whether this is from war trauma or birth. He keeps a journal and narrates throughout. As time goes on the viewer is drawn into his reality and desire to act to "clean up" the filth (literal and figurative) rather than being a passive observer of it.

Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role. He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.
The film (much more than a mere `fishing film') tells the true story of two brothers growing up (and growing apart) in Montana.  Norman and Paul are a peculiar pair, two boys cut from the same mold and yet very different, very distinct.  Norman (the films narrator) has dreams much larger than his Montana home, while Paul dwells in the comforts (and vices) that come from his laid back life, soaking up the fly-fishing of his youth and making it a central part of his present.  But, life lessons come hard for the pair as they buck society, especially Paul who is an apologetic rebel with a severe losing streak (and substantial gambling debts).

And again why are they all playing or humming the same musical notes, that is innately foreign to them? Just what exactly is happening to them? And more importantly, what did the sighting of these U.F.O.'s do to them, so that their previously "normal" behavior is now erratic, compulsive and even  obsessive? What is the secret of Devil's Tower in conjunction with the U.F.O. witnesses that are driven to get there, come what may? While thousands of others, who live around the Devil's Tower/Wyoming area, are being systematically evacuated from the surrounding region by the United States Government, no less? What's happening? Could it be that the American Government and officials from foreign countries are conducting celestial experiments and communicating with martians and other space aliens? If so, why wasn't the public told? And if the U.S. and combined allied governments are not exploring space communications, are we being invaded, unknowingly? And why are the witnesses of these U.F.O. sightings... world over, being patronized and talked too... as if they all, at the same time, have suddenly gone crazy? What is going on?! And what is a CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND, anyway? Within this enormously popular, 1977, color, extraterrestrial, Box Office-smash hit, film: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - the 30th, 2-disc, DVD set, Anniversary Edition which was remastered in High Definition with Dolby 5.1 Sound, mesmerizes and visually stuns the viewing audience with brilliant special effects, story and content. This amazing, science-fiction blockbuster which was directed by the Academy Award-winning Director - Steven Spielberg, dramatically astounds and comically amuses it's audience with it's ultra-creative, big-screen, special effects and overall wonderful story and superb contents. This Columbia Pictures/EMI presentation of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION is nothing short of spectacular! This controversial yet fascinating topic about U.F.O.'s and the people that witness their sighting, is as intriguing as it is, engaging. Are we alone? According to this awesome movie extravaganza, apparently not. This incredibly popular motion picture was so well done, that it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and rightly, so! Because this is not just another excellent film, it is truly, a motion picture event! Steven Spielberg clearly shows his creative genius as both, a Screenplay Writer and Director of this riveting film. So, that brings us to the obvious question: What exactly is a CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND? Good question. The FIRST ENCOUNTER - is the witnessing of an actual unidentified flying object (U.F.O.), flying through the sky. The SECOND ENCOUNTER - is the discovery of physical evidence which validates that there was an actual appearance of an unidentified flying object (U.F.O.). And the THIRD ENCOUNTER - is the actual contact with the U.F.O. and/or it's alien inhabitants. And this film also brilliantly illustrates as well as educates, the viewing public - with dramatic flair and pockets of cosmic relief, about all three forms of U.F.O. encounters. And because this awesome motion picture deals with a very unique topic and the subsequent emotions and personal drama that is associated with but kept under wraps when experiencing and dealing with U.F.O. sightings. Or what one 'thinks' is an unidentified flying object and the rejection and disbelief that one faces from the scoffers and the nay-sayer's, resounds world over with the viewing audience. Why? Because people usually think that a person who says that they have seen a U.F.O., have just had a bad session with their psychiatrist and are hallucinating or that their medication needs to be adjusted. Others, are thought to have 'popped one too many' illegal pills and are "tripping!" Or that they have '...fallen of of the wagon...' and are back on the bottle. Either that, or they have smoked and inhaled a little to much of their marijuana or hashish - joint/reefer cigarette, and are now... flying high, together with their imaginary, little green men and Martian brethren. Or lastly, that they are just plain losing their mind. Sounds reasonable, right?! Because after all, there is no such thing as a U.F.O., right?! Not according to Roy Neary - played by Actor Richard Dreyfuss, who had a 'sighting' and then some, while driving to work in his cable truck, one night. A happily married, husband and father who up to that point, had no mental or emotional "instabilities" and was thought to be "normal", had absolutely nothing better to do other than ruin his marriage and relationship with his children by coming home in the middle of the night, claiming that he saw an unidentified flying object. It completely changed his life and led him and all others that saw the U.F.O.'s, on a celestial quest of discovery which culminated at a mountain-like structure, named: Devil's Tower. This superb film which brilliantly depicts an epic odyssey of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, is a colossal, big-screen, achievement. Produced by Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips with music by John Williams, it stars: Actors Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary; Actress Teri Garr as his wife  Ronnie Neary; Francois Truffant as Claude Lacombe and Melinda Dillon as Julian Guiler. It comes in spoken English with subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And, as if that weren't enough, this electrifying motion picture comes with a Steven Spielberg cast and crew, interview; deleted scenes; theatrical trailers and the making of a documentary and behind the behind the scenes footage of this incredible, one-of-a-kind, epic production. This is one entertaining movie which will take you out of your comfort zone with it's dazzling creativity and wondrous amazement, in search of the cosmic unknown. So, get your popcorn ready, get good and comfy and ENJOY! Because in every sense, this is an awesome film and a true sight and thrill to behold! And a definite keeper for your 'must have' DVD collection! Nina Kish
Deleted Scenes
Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin move in and out of this film in a headspinning variety of roles.  From tapdancing knights to a killer rabbit to rude Frenchmen throwing livestock from the top of a castle, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is wacky, satisfying comic bliss.  By far the best of all the Python films.

7941	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	When considering Terry Gilliams body of film work picking a best film Is near impossible, and the Fisher King is no exception to this rule. Here, Gilliam tells a tale of redemption mixing humor and drama and vivid imagery. Long after the film ends, moments stay with you ranging from the elegance of the Grand Central Station waltz to the horror of Robin Williams history-teacher-turned-amnesiac-homeless-guy being chased down the streets of New York by the Dark Knight on horseback as he relives the shooting death of his wife in flashback. The performances by Jeff Bridges, Amanda Plummer, (an Oscar winning) Mercedes Rhul and, of course, Williams are pitch perfect and lend depth and gravity to the material. Definitely worth seeing if youve never seen it.

Dreyfuss is a normal man living a normal life. Alien spaceships, visually beautiful, begin visiting far-flung locations on Earth. They are revered by some, while others are threatened, and yet others refuse to accept it's happening. It's not that there are Good Guys or Bad Guys. It is more how all of us react to a knowledge which is new and strange. Do we hide from it? Embrace it? If you're a mother, do you let your child get drawn off by these unknown creatures? The movie does a great job of showing all sides, how the aliens *might* be friendly - or they *might* be a threat. How can one know? The government is trying to get a handle on things without causing a panic. Is that a proper response? Anyone who's seen the TV series 24 knows how tricky that type of decision can be.
5626	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I actually have never seen Fright Night until recently on American Movie Classics and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Although Roddy McDowell looks pretty silly with his hair and eyebrews being covered in white powder he still brings a lot of charm and humor to the film. He has a lot of fun scenes as a Horror film star/vampire slayer. Chris Sarandon (Child's Play) is very good as well as the head vampire. If you liked other modern vampire flicks like The Lost Boys and From Dusk Till Dawn check out Fright Night. It is funny, sexxy and even sometimes pretty damn scary.
The strength of this really excellent film is that it brings to life an ancient myth that through redemption we become better people and as better people, we can move out of our own self interest and move toward the heroic act of helping another and as we heal, the kingdom becomes a better place for us all.
It's my opinion, but I think it is what the videogame warranted.

It is certainly worth every penny because you will watch Holy Grail over and over again(each time hearing something hilarious that you didn't hear before!). Every single scene is packed with laughs, there is never a dull moment! I have seen everything that Python has done and this is without a doubt my favorite. The special features on the second disk are hilarious as well, Michael Palin and Terry Jones go back and visit all of the movie sets, and you can also see the behind the scenes film(complete with interviews) that aired on the BBC in the seventies. This movie will have you hystericaly laughing, and is a wonderful representation of the outrageous humor that has been keeping people laughing for decades!! You will not be disappointed with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is a classic comedy that anyone who likes to laugh should own!!!

5031	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Even though he's only made four movies, Wes Anderson is one of the most talented, interesting, and quirky directors in the business.  He's still young, but with only four films under his belt he's already become a synonym for a very distinct type of filmmaking, e.g. "That movie was kind of Wes Andersonish."  Having seen the final three films of the Anderson canon (RUSHMORE, THE ROYAL TENEBAUMS, and THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU), I finally had the opportunity to see Anderson's debut feature, BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie begins rather slowly, but by the end I was laughing my head off and decided BOTTLE ROCKET was my second favorite film next to THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU.
So, with the Broadway production of "Annie" coming to a close, in 1982, Columbia Pictures released "Annie" based on the Broadway musical.  Directed by actor/filmmaker John Huston ("The Maltese Falcon", "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", "The African Queen"), the film would star an ensemble cast which included Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrman and the film debut of Aileen Quinn.
The DVD specials consist of the usual fare - making, storyboards, trailers etc. There was some problem with my DVD and I couldn't see the 'making' completely. But it was good till the point I had seen, so no gripes. Get the DVD!!
Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called "The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.

Here is a President who FIGHTS BACK against terrorists!  GARY OLDMAN gets to play the terrorist, who is some sort of RUSSIAN neo-natioanolist type named Korshunov!  Everybody on the plane wants the president to be SAFE, but not our HERO!  Nice job by GLENN CLOSE as the Vice-President with DEAN STOCKWELL doing an Al Haig impersonation and WILLIAM MACY as a regular air force guy!

5 Star = Masterpiece
---------- Apocalypse deals heavily with Alice regaining her forgotten memory after she is captured and subjected to tests and the secondary star of the movie "Nemesis" who was her friend, Matt Addison. While the movie deals with the subject of the undead, the plot is strictly character driven in the every way possible; You actual care about what will happen to all the people who survived the outbreak in Raccoon City. The scare factor in the movie for me has diminished somewhat after I conquered my fear of watching it but it still holds some kind of fear over me when it comes to all the Undead scenes which are truly something to be scared about for the "most" part. Milla Jovovich's character Alice kicks Jill Valentine (who really isn't given much to do in the movie) to the passengers seat and really kicks major ass in this movie, the action scenes in this movie are a sight to behold, its practically nonstop through out the entire movie but does nothing to dissipate the movie's twisting plot.
Milla Jovovich plays Joan, a simple, illiterate peasent girl who came from a farming town in Lorrain, France out of no where.  In this movie, often ignored by other biographies or cinematic undertakings, we see how she was affected by the toils of war when her sister is murdered by English soldiers.  We also see how with a child's innocence she loves God and wants nothing but to find joy within going to mass and prayer.  Perhaps it is because of these reasons that she has her first visions as a young girl, innocent of the outside world and looking to the church for answers.  At age 19, she leaves her hometown to see the Daulphaine of France, played with the dignity and hauting ability that only John Malcovich can portray.  She seeks an audience with him to tell him that she has been chosen by God to lead his army against the English in the 100 Years War and see him rightly crowned as the King of France.

Lux Interior (the Cramps) would tell Steve-O, and you for that matter, 'You ain't no punk, YOU PUNK!' After throwing away enough of my life to some silly movement that expressed my anger quite vividly I'd say Steve-O was  just as punk as anything else that came down the pike. I'm just glad he had the sense to move on and not let an art fad become his life. That's right hanger on-er's. Punk was just one big art fad. Time to let go and find something else or find nothing at all.
Overall, an emotionally award-winning performance all around.
I'm not sure I would have wanted to see The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland at the theatre, but youngsters would surely have loved such an experience.  Elmo asks the audience for help on several occasions, so parents should be prepared for having their kids yell out helpful words and sounds from time to time (FYI - I wouldn't recommend sitting directly in front of your children during the Queen of Trash sequence).  Parents also shouldn't worry too much about children becoming too upset over Elmo's misfortunes.  Whenever things start to look bad, Bert comes out and has the movie stopped and Ernie explains to him that there's still time for a happy ending.

Yes, it is a Christian-centered workout with soft Christian vocals and instrumental music. I am a Christian, so I was very familiar with the lyrics and tunes. They were very modern versions and had a nice ambiant feel to them. I love all of Tonya's workouts and appreciate her Spiritual Warm-Ups and everything about her routines. This was a yoga-based routine, but she used no yoga terminalogy in describing the moves. It was very professional. I do, however enjoy a lot of yoga routines that do use the authentic yoga/sanskrit names and words. I love Raviana workouts too. Tonya is very professional, and soft-spoken and the set,music and the mats and their outfits were nice and modern. I really like this one and you can use it in segments or do the whole thing!

6258	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	I got suckered in, I'll admit it. I kept telling myself that the sequel will be better than the original. But it wasn't. The plot was all over the place and there were just too many predictable moments followed by a useless need to just deliver action without a comprehendable story. It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?' It just gets repeatative. What results is a movie that could have been better but failed to even make par. Better luck next time, guys. And if that isn't enough, there's a hint that there might be another sequel. Oh brother is all I have to say. The only thing that saved this movie was the fact that it had a lot of good cinematograpghy and style. Also, the token black guy was hilarious throughout the whole movie. But, trust me on this folks, rent it. Don't buy it.
My only complaint is the limited use of Lickers, they seemed to focus more on the zombie dogs instead.
2754	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Been a fan of the movie since it first came out. This Criterion edition looks great on my TV screen and sounds great too, even the LPCM mono track!  But the art work, out side and in, is about as plain as Led Zeppelin's choice of clothes for their 02 concert. Tasteless! But then that's been Criterion's tradition. I'd say their worst cover choice was their Gimme Shelter edition.

When watching the paranoid SF film 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', and it's sequel, the films are warning us, ironically, of mind control emanating from Hollywood? Planet of the Apes is warning us not just of mental degradation, a society where the humans don't speak, but also a kind of racial replacement? Enough is enough already with these old films?

I don't feel compelled to write any further, read the other one-star reviews they mirror my feelings.

My DVD does not flash English subtitles after I've switched them off, but let the buyer beware; maybe some initial pressings were defective.  Certainly there are Swedish subtitles beneath the opening credits, but they're part of the original negative -- not to be turned off.  Whatever the case, there are hours of "extras" and 2 separate "commentaries" to play during the film, and I'm very happy with the Special Edition.  You get two discs for the price of one, more or less, and the "extras" really are worth delving into.
Pick it up for a treat for next Christmas.

3517	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Love this movie.  I tend to like the version that I saw in the theater in the 70's.  I never really cared for the re-releases, but of course they are interesting to watch.  The video and audio of this release is outstanding.
When the movie was first released Watergate scandal / conspiracy was fresh off the press.  Spielberg has said he included a government cover up, to add a sense of realism, even if it is a sort of bluff: how does the audience know that these things of the movie, as well, aren't, 'actually going on right now,' just not the news?  Then again, while CE3K begins, it does not end, in a familiar mock docudrama format (also known to audiences at the time from 'documentaries' on Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster); there is even a character in CE3K who, as a believer in both, compares Big Foot to UFOs in the same breath at a press conference, to Neary's humiliation.  If the film is dated (of course it is in incidental things, like the Nearys' home furnishing, e.g., the color portable boob tube, complete with a dial to change channels, the aviator style glasses so many are wearing, along with the obvious absence in the storyline of GPS and cell phone cameras) I don't think it can be dated in this way.  The film's realism, to its credit, only cuts both ways.  The conspiracy aspect of the film is actually quite limited; the film really only presents it as Major Walsh's idea, for the sake of evacuating people, to secure the area.  Neary is its chief, largely unintentional, victim.  Neary at one point says, 'the army is getting us out of here because they don't want any witnesses.'  They?  Meaning Lacombe?  Neary doesn't say who 'they' is because Neary doesn't (yet) know who they is.  Lacombe, was arguing with Walsh, at that very moment.
1. The guy gets ready and does all this training to, in the end, kill 3 or 4 low life losers, some of which were not armed and even tried not to provoke him? The basically provoked them and acted like some sort of tough guy. The whole movie sets you up, making you sort of think that he was going after big game aka the possible presidential candidate when the whole time, after all the training he's done....he took out 3 low-life's, which by the way sucks and made the ending really disappointing. It's like the whole plot revolves around the end where he kills those guys.

Back in the early '80s, "Annie" was one of the first films I watched on cable.  At the time, "Annie" was a big part of American culture thanks to the Broadway play and the music.

Dreyfuss plays Roy Neary, working-class father and husband who witnesses what he believes to be a UFO. He finds himself tortured by visions seemingly stuck in his head, and he becomes obsessed with UFOs. Like an alcoholic, Neary soon falls apart, losing his job, friends and eventually his family in several harrowing scenes. He befriends Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), a single mother who has also witnessed these UFOs and is obsessed with similar visions. Her son is abducted by the aliens in one of the most terrifying scenes in film history. Together, this tortured couple eventually realizes these visions are mysteriously pointing them towards Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Frantically, they travel there even though the U.S. military claims a train wreck has caused deadly gas to cover the countryside. Scientist Claude Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) and his eccentric team have devised a musical language enabling them to communicate with the UFOs. The meeting place is, of course, Devil's Tower in Wyoming. Neary and Guiler fight their way to the mountain, stumbling upon a government-constructed landing strip where Lacombe and his scientists hope to meet the aliens. An enormous mothership appears and contact is made with aliens for the first time in human history.

Some observers have discerned a homoerotic subtext in Ragsdale's obsession with his handsome, vampiric neighbor, and also in Sarandon's pursuit of Ragsdale's high school buddy (Stephen Geoffreys, also known as 'Sam Ritter', star of gay adult movies like VIRTUAL STUD and SEX ON THE BEACH), and while there's some merit in this particular reading, it doesn't get in the way of the slam-bang melodramatics. Geoffreys adopts a range of tics and mannerisms which will infuriate some viewers and endear him to others, but his final sequence - one of the best in the entire movie - is charged with genuine emotion (rendered even moreso by McDowall's extraordinary, wordless performance on the sidelines), and the 'death rattle' which accompanies Geoffreys' departure is one of the creepiest sound effects this reviewer has EVER heard!!...

Going now to the servants, there's Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There's also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in "The Hero's Farewell," one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won't be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.

This is one of the most AWESOME achievements in cinematic history, a triumph of human imagination, and a film that has a truly noble, altruistic agenda, in an era of otherwise formulaic "beastie" monster movies.  It gets the awesome transfer, in all 3 versions, that it deserves.  Spielberg's critics said "lightning can't strike twice" after the wunderkind young director struck a massive bolt with his last stroke of genius, Jaws.  They were wrong!

I bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day.

There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.

A couple things I just want to mention -- my theory is that the Monty Python guys set out to satirize not only the medieval world, but the nature of power, and it's relation to myth.  I took an amazing course once on this topic with Prof. Laurence DeLooze, and he pointed out a lot of intriguing things.  This movie can actually really get you thinking about what rationalizations underlie any powerful institutions, kingship or otherwise.  Or even what rationalizations we employ every day to justify our own behavior, Sir Lancelot's shenanigans at the wedding party being the case in point.  What if you didn't respond to some of the situations they portray with laughter, but with outrage?  Perhaps that is a better response.  Especially having read Eric Idle's remarkably sophisticated ideas about the nature of humor in a book he recently came out with, I'm inclined to suspect that these dudes had a few (good) ideas in mind, behind the laughter they've provoked for a quarter of a century.  Just a thought.
4757	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Interesting through both its character development - De Niro as the taxi driver - and cinematography. Very slow at times, especially past the mid-point of the movie. Historically interesting as the movie that initiated John Hinkley's obesssion with Jodie Foster and eventually led him to attempt to assassinate President Reagan.
Ray is not merely an abusive drunk; he is a horrible bastard, always prone to violent outbursts. When his wife hangs out with a casual male acquaintance, he suspects that she may be having an affair and damn near kills her.
The movie begins with a very familiar concept to the hardcore RE gamers. The breakout of the virus, S.T.A.R.S. team infiltration, and so on. I don't feel the need to rewrite the synopsis of the movie, which you can get from the Official movie website and Amazon's own review. What I am going to say is that there's plenty of action, gore, mutated zombies, zombie-dogs and so on. Milla Jovovich will keep keep you enthralled herself, I guess that's reason enough for men to see it, ya? The "Red Queen" is the eeriest thing in the movie, "You're all going to die here." Not an original line, but the visual and tone of her/it is quite enough to give you the chills. I recommend watching the movie to find out what the "Red Queen" is. To me that was a reason to stay in my seat and be thankful that there were other people in the theater. The DVD is a hit, sharp, crisp, and chillingly Gothic. All the things I love.
being somewhat facetious but thats how it was
I thought the movie had a lot of great character performances, and clever scripting, and I think this movie got a bum rap. It's really a great movie, I'm glad I bought the DVD. The transfer is a little sloppy in places on the one I bought, but since it's a "Special Anniversary Edition", I have a feeling that had something to do with it. There's only a fullscreen version on my DVD, no widescreen, and the camera pans are really noticeable in a few places.
9294	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Let me tell you this: the first time I watched this film, I don't think I laughed at it once. It seemed distant to me, a strange film that was sort of comical-looking, but it just plain didn't click with me. A few days later, I told someone I'd seen it, and then, for some reason, in description of it, it became utterly hilarious. And that's the way Monty Python seems to work. If you're not already initiated to the Monty Python style of humor, just go talk to someone who loves it, and suddenly you'll find yourself laughing like you've never laughed before. It's like the film just may be so brilliant that you need a little help to get you to realize that there's a joke, even with it glaring you directly in the eyes. The Python troupe, on top of that, plays it like they're in a period piece for most of the time -- throughout the film I don't believe a single one of them cracks more than the smallest smile. Of course, when I saw the film again, I was in stitches, and I am forever a Python fan. And while one of the most brilliant jokes I've ever seen doesn't appear in this film (it's in Monty Python's Meaning of Life, and it involved an animated leaf), there's definitely more than enough gut-busting Pythonesque madness here to sate your laughter or you might want to check for a pulse -- you may think you're going for a walk, but you're not fooling anyone.

4593	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Heard a lot about this movie.  Finally broke down and watched it.  I really didn't like it, It really didn't make any sense and it dragged to much for me.  I thought it was to slow and boring.

If you have doubts about this series, forget them.  It's worth every penny for hours and hours of head scratching amusement.  It can be a bit "stodgy" I suppose for the younger viewers but for an old crone like myself - absolutely wonderful.

A counter-culture rebel who never could quite come to terms with the Vietnam era government he so distrusted. Not surprisingly, his portrayal of "Billy", the frantic companion to Peter Fonda's "Wyatt" is the constantly racing heart of Easy Rider, one of the most important films of the late sixties.

My grand-daughter invariably joins in the singing of almost every song.  She gets up and dances with Annie, Molly and the gang during every dance number, and she still, figuratively, sits on the edge of her seat during the big chase scene.  She, unlike the more sophisticated reviewers here, is in love with Molly.  She cries when Molly cries, and feels better when Annie soothes Molly.

6465	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This movie is for any Streisand fan to watch. The casting of Barbra as a New York psychiatrist is excellent as Nolte as a football coach who comes to New York to help is sister who tried to commit suicide. Tom played by Nick Nolte falls in love with Barbra's character Dr. Lowenstein, both are married but not happily. I'll save the ending for the movie. The music, the acting including Barbra's son Jason Gould is high caliber. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a well done movie, this is one heck of a movie.
5059	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I saw this movie when it was released to the  theaters in the '70s.  In New York City.  In a moviehouse in Times Square.  The theatre  was full of blacks and there were roaches running up the walls and cum all over  the seats and this is the  only way to see this movie:  Sit right in  the  middle  of  the theater  of action  while it  is all over the screen.  I walked out with my friends after  it was  over into the late afternoon sun and none  of us  needed to say anything.  This totally is a New York movie about going insane in New York City and cathartically divesting yourself of the whole mess you find yourself in in a very lethal way and  getting away with  it, then returning  to normalcy, having been cleansed of the demons which drove you into  madness in the first place.  Heavy duty.  Love this movie.

438	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	All time favorite movie!!!! Based on the Biblical account of Joseph & how his brothers sold him into slavery and how God turned the situation all around!!  Excellent movie.  If you've never read the story or saw the movie - this is a must.  Its' stellar performances by the actors makes it even more enjoyable.  One word of caution, the scene where Potifar's wife tries to seduce Joseph while bathing is extremely steamy & sexual. That's unfortunate because other than that scene and one other scene that's sexual in nature, this would have been an excellent movie to watch with a church group.  But in my opinion, it's too steamy for mixed company and/or church viewing.  Other than that, it's an A+++++ movie!!!  The ending will bring you to tears!
This movie was chosen to be preserved and added to the National Film Registry in 2007 by the National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress.
8412	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about "Annie," but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original.
To begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more "hip." Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one "shoot 'em up" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called "scary" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the "Nemesis" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.

Its not all about Rumpole even if he is the star.  His fellowed learned gentlemen baristers in Chambers are all equally vivid odd characters in their own right.  Number 3 Equity Court is a place alive with all manner of intriques.  Its not Law and Order or The Practice but in its own way many weighty legal elements are thoughtfully explored.
But still, Arnie proves he's best at comedy; Terminator was O.K., but spoofing himself is where he seems most relaxed.

1705	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Apart from the obvious important issue of color, "Lost Color Archives" is different from many other documentaries dealing with World War II.  The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals.  Its use of personal observances is remeniscent of the way Ken Burns used eye witness accounts in "The Civil War" to make more of an impact on the viewer.

Hewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why "her people can't dance". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain. As mediocre and tired as I found the first film, the script for "part two" manages to show it up in every way except the good kind.

For an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie.

6462	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	The events of "The Prince of Tides" play out in such a fashion that one tends to forget how soapy and melodramatic they really are. What begins as one man's emotional awakening to the events of his past in an attempt to help his sibling generates into a run-of-the-mill romance easily found in the pages of any Harlequin novel. And yet, through acting zeal and its abidance by the rules of tearjerkers, this film actually pays off in a weird sort of way.

The basic plotline: Umbrella, a sinister mega-corporation which profits from bio-engineering & genetic alteration aimed towards warfare while operating under the guise of a General-Electric type company, has a massive underground lab. Nine-to-fivers work there like they would in an ordinary office, live there, eat & shop there, shut away from the world above. This is all hidden under a pristine mansion. Some criminal jerk decides to steal a very lethal viral agent known as the T-Virus, intentionally loosing the virus in the process, causing all hell to break loose. Everybody down below dies, re-animate as zombies. A "crack" SWAT team swoops in to find an amnesiac agent and a do-gooder trying to bring down Umbrella. Zombies attack, and most of the squad dies in a laser room before most of the action goes down. Later, mutant dogs abd beasts attack, Milla does her "Matrix" routine....you get the point.
This new DVD version is beautiful.

No matter where you look, Gattaca astounds you, and holds up against the years. It is destined to become a science fiction classic.
The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.


I can't imagine any harder task than to try to compete with Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, and face the inevitable comparisons.  No mean task, to be sure, and a brave one.  But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are wonderful.  Of course, there are many parallels in their characterizations, but they still manage to create their own style and chemistry.  With the back-up of great supporting actors and a witty, caustic script, they make the characters and story their own.
And there will be a next time was the message, someone will go off the deep end, but not necessarily Travis. He is not the problem. That's how I experienced the ending....Travis shocked by his own eyes in the cab mirror...those eyes could belong to anyone riding the cab.  After all the Travis character did not have threatening eyes.  De Nero's eyes in fact sometimes burst out with happy sparkles.  Rather his eyes are universal, the potential harm or good lurking there determined by how we see things and whether we feel we can act to improve things.

I first saw this movie when I was 11 or 12 and it had just come out on video, and even as a little kid I knew that this was a special movie. It's a hard movie to really explain, but it's an engaging movie that will catch you off guard. It has a quirky story filled with eccentric characters that centers around the power of friendship and redemption. The Fisher King has an amazing ability to make you laugh out loud one minute, and another make you fight from having a tear in your eye. I honestly don't know whether you should call it a comedy or a drama, because it does both of those so well, while balancing shades of romance.

8242	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	To paraphrase that well-filled-out fellow, "It's easy to get people into jail, much harder to keep them out." What a delight! The inimitable wry humor and intelligence of Rumpole ages well. Brits place real people, with shapes, wrinkles, character, and rumples in front of the camera. So get through the first, slow-moving episode, and then settle down for a delicious experience with the irascible Rumpole. With each successive story, the narrative develops and thickens like Rumpole's brown sauce, while picture and sound quality improves. John Mortimer's introductions are inimitable, though one may take exception to the ghoulish glee when he recounts blood-stains in "Rumpole and the Heavy Brigade," Disk 2; this doesn't detract from the overall excellence. Even the minefields of race and culture conflict are elegantly handled, showing the presumptuousness of assuming all minorities share the same beliefs; deftly done! You'd better have plenty of victuals on hand; the Brain of Rumpole requires much sustenance to maintain girth and mirth and insight. Suggestible viewers will hunger unless proper precautions are taken, with assorted cheeses. You're in for a treat. Enjoy!

The story has a thought-provoking premise, but as part of my own thought being provoked I came up with the following questions:
The commentary track on this DVD is somewhat entertaining but not particularly incisive - I was definitely expecting more insights from director/writer James Merendino, but he comes off somewhat disjointedly and nowhere near as thoughtful as the film he himself wrote and made.
Laura Mars, as portrayed by Faye Dunaway, is a high end New York City fashion photographer who has found widespread commercial success through her color and black and white photographs which glamorize death and murder.  Only the death begins to strike very close to Laura when her publisher is murdered and Laura sees the murder in a nightmare.

It's truly an awesome film achievement, nominated for 8 Oscars, but not Best Picture. I have no end of admiration for Spielberg's film, in any of its incarnations.

A class act, and a courageous performance, in both cases.

I think that this covers exactly  how I've been feeling and what I've been thinking about as I get older.  It's also got a great punk music soundtrack.

"A Canadian is like  an American, but without a gun!"  But great troupes like these are  inspired by British Troupe Monty Python.  And this movie is what they will  always be most famous for, and possibly their best work.  From the rude  frenchmen to the witch trials to the Black Knight, this movie is just  chock-loaded with senseless acts of comedy.  Oh, and lets not forget the oh  so dangerous rabbit, the black beast of "ugh", the sissy prince,  the 3-headed, ill-tempered, disagreeable knight, the ladies of Castle  Anthrax...oh i could go on and on, but this movie is makin me laugh too  much, so just go buy it and stop listening to me before my laughing gets  contagious and makes u go to the restroom...
But the first problem with the movie is that it jumps into the plot right away.  No build up (people say this is scary?  all the good horror movies have some sort of build up and suspense, for an example: watch Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining"), which makes the film not scary at all.

3317	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	A favorite movie of mine. I grew up with it. For better or worse, movies like this and ET made me mistrustful of the government at a very early age. The adult me can also relate to the story which involves a man who abandons his loud kids and nagging wife to fly away away (to who knows where?) with a bunch of aliens. Oh, and it looks good in HD too.

Jodie Foster, as the damsel prostitute, gives a performance that borders on the impossible.  How an actress at that age could possibly play a hooker that convincingly either belies an eerily acute level of observation skills or a very poor upbringing.  I'd say her two Academy Awards probably eliminate the latter option.
There was a nice twist in the end, which made up nicely for the fact taht we already knew the identity of the killer.
-Better than average acting for a film of this genre.
  Essentially, Taxi Driver is one of the most slept on films of the 1970's.  Although it made a big impact at the time of its release, the touchy subject matter made it difficult for TV stations to air it to a home audience.

There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.

It's all too rare to find movies with a positive resolution instead of cheering on a heroic character that might or might not deserve said cheer. We're left with a hopeful wondering of our future, and that has so much more of a payoff than anything that has come since.

7054	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	One of the worst movie versions of a great play I've ever seen.  Among the more significant misses in the movie: (1) changing the ending to an unnecessary death-like cliffhanger; and (2) turning the Mrs. Hannigan character into a drunk rather than someone who doesn't know how to deal with children and is terrified of them.  Absolutely awful.
1950	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Air Force One kept me on the edge of my seat for two hours, and the only time I found wishing it would be over sooner was when the tension was getting to be more intense than I wanted to deal with.  Nevertheless, when the hero is Harrison Ford and the bad guys are communist mobsters, I'll stick with it until the end!
Okay, so like I said, the singing is spotty (Finney, I love you but really?) and the dance numbers are somewhat spastic (some are great, some are ridiculous) but it all works and it is all entertaining, no doubt.  Little Aileen Quinn is an annoying little child and a really bad actress but she can sing (if that really was her) and her renditions of `Tomorrow' and the like are really nicely done.  Albert Finney, like I said, is bored.  He yells a lot and sings out of key but I just love him.  Really, the best thing about this movie is Carol Burnett who is all sorts of hilarious in this movie.  She give Hannigan the right balance of well intentioned cruelty to make her a character you love to hate.

9334	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	A number of film critics have been rendered red-faced by this movie, practically forced into issuing revisionist statements to their reviews published at the time of the film's release.  Whether the change of heart is due to improved understanding of the text or to the pressures of popular canonization, this Holy Grail has proven one of the most commonly shared quests of followers separated by as much as 3 generations.  Film teachers are often disappointed to discover that young viewers no longer respond with interest let alone animation to Chaplin and Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields.  The reasons are often attributed to the desensiticizing effects of fast-food modern culture, or to the postmodern amnesia that insures satire can not possibly work with an audience unfamiliar with the original objects of satire.  All interesting, if not compelling, theories--until you come to this film.  For a singular 90 minutes, the generations unite, erasing the boundaries of high and low culture, the informed and the uninformed, the old and the young.  There aren't many such grails left.  Long may this one continue to reside in viewers' consciousness, inspiring us to our individual and collective pursuits.

5083	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	The haunting musical soundtrack to this movie contains some of the most beautiful jazzy pieces I have ever heard.  I had a custom tape made from it at one time.  The story is a great psycho-drama with all of the players perfectly cast.  Jodie Foster is believable as the "baby prostitute," Harvey Kietel, chilling as her pimp and Robert DeNiro is so fascinating to study as Travis Bickle, wierd product of NY subculture of the streets and psychological textbook example.  It is, in retrospect, a brilliant example of post-Vietnam War 1970's atmosphere in the large cities of our country.  Maybe too wierd of a movie for some to watch, but a mainstay of the viewing repretoire of a true artist.


Oh well, enough of that. I am one of this film's fans. Let me say up front that I realise that it has some fairly fundamental believability problems. However, if you hang your belief on the peg at the door and accept the film for what it really /is/ and ignore the director/producer/actor waffle on the "Making of" documentary about how they loved playing the game and wanted to reproduce the experience in the cinema then there should be no reason to really hate the film. And what it really is, is a zombie flick for the 21st century. Pure, simple and unambiguous. It has all the elements. A dwindling cast of "survivors" are trapped or confined in an environment that is literally crawling with the undead. Cue heroics, treachery, an enormous body-count and an ordnance expenditure that would shame the US Army. It's not all guns, though and the more usual means of zombie-disposal - decapitation by means of a handy fire-axe, iron pipe or simple neck-twist - is preserved for the pleasure of the traditionalists.

8108	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	'Rumpole of the Bailey' is one of my favourite book series, and is also one of my favourite television series of all time.  Spanning well over a decade, Thames television produced over 40 episodes of the crusty old barrister's tales, penned both for book and screen by John Mortimer, who used to take delight in highlighting silliness in judicial judgements by putting those decisions into the guise of his own judges, perhaps most especially judge Bullingham.
9293	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I wasn't sure I'd like "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" after all these years, but as soon as I popped in the videotype, I remembered exactly why I once found this film so funny.  The humor is incredibly irreverent and, after all these years, iconic.  Who can forget the argument about sparrows carrying coconuts to England, or the killer rabbit, or the serenade to Sir Robin?  The humor ranges from satire to potty jokes, from dark humor to downright silliness.  As with all Monty Python movies, the scenes hang loosely together, and some seem included merely because the writers came up with a joke over a few pints and couldn't bear to exclude it.


In fact, it is the genetic code which determines all. Test-tube babies are the norm for anyone who wants to have a chance; screening out imperfections has become routine, and those who have the misfortune of being born outside the system of genetic checks and balances will find themselves invalid (in-valid in the sense of not valid for work, as well as invalid in the sense of incapacitated for advancement). Society has been structured around a pre-defined sense of potential as projected by genetic codes. But there are a few who challenge the system.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Midnight Express makes its high-definition debut with a very solid 1080p image presentation. It looks quite good, especially for a film that's thirty-plus years old; skin tones are natural, fine grain is present but not distracting, and the clean 1.85:1 image shows no scratches, dirt, or other age artefacts. Alan Parker and Cinematographer Michael Seresin work mostly in an earth colour palate, heavy on the browns, and some of the wide shots, particularly in the opening sequence, are almost sepia-toned. But within its limited saturation, the colours are rich and full and the same goes for the black levels, a considerable feat in a film this dark and a closing shot, in which Billy Hayes emerges from a dense swath of darkness, is particularly notable, as is a wonderful silhouette shot of Hurt smoking and calling out for his cat. The attention to detail is also marvellous, particularly the grime and muck of the prison walls. With no compression artefacts, edge enhancement, this is about as good a presentation as we could hope for.

SERIES 4: 13 wartime episodes averaging 51 minutes each cover years 1914-18. The Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends.

Jude Law is heartbreaking as the "perfect" human who is all-too-flawed.  And who doesn't like watching Uma Thurman?  Two thumbs way up!
When watching Close Encounters again, I knew what to expect. There were the 'astronauts', young people from all over the globe, dressed in their suits and apparently, waiting to board the alien ships. And the small aliens leave their ship, seemingly to be exchanged with them and ready to spend some time on Earth. I'd read stories of explorers and natives making exchanges like this, for the purpose of language acquisition, this scene reminded me of these stories. When the alien ship leaves, however, at the end of the film, no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the ship? Is it just me, or at the end, does the film show Richard Dreyfuss and no one else, getting on the alien ship before it leaves? The aliens sure went to a lot of trouble to pick up one guy from Indiana. I watched the ending again (although I haven't see all three versions), and it's true, no one but Richard Dreyfuss gets on the alien ship.
One of the great things about Spielberg is that he actually explains why he shoots a scene a certain way or how he came up with a particular shot. Most directors go "well...thought it would be cool" but as he says in the excellent documentary on the making of the film; sure the mothership coming up from behind the mountain instead of the sky doesn't make any sense but it's an awesome image so who cares if it's not realistic. Included with the set is deleted scenes that didn't make the cut including the fate of the police officer who chased, (and flew over a ditch), one of the UFO's as well as the interior of the mothership with Spielberg being right saying it should've been a mystery.

viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.
The first one was good sci-fi/horror movie, good and kind of interesting caracters, good zombies, a good storyline and well directed. Now the second, sorry but this is very bad, i gave two stars because of the action sequences, they were entertaining but that'S it!!
Ford is President James Marshall. He seems to be the embodyment of the American dream. He has a loving family, and seems to be the leader in the upcoming election now that he's captured a Russian general responsible for the death of millions. But that all changes when he announces that the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists at a convention in Moscow. But that all changes on the flight back to Washington. A group of Russian terrorists led by Gary Oldman hijack Air Force One. When they threaten to kill, Ford is forced to choose between going against his policy or sacrifying lives of the passangers on board - including his wife and daughter. Nonstop action combines with convincing acting, especially by Ford, Oldman and Glenn Close as the vice president. In fact, Ford is so convincing, it makes you wish he was really president. Great film.

Bottom line...I really enjoy most all of these movies a lot and its a brilliant display package and the book is really truly first class, with loads of quality color pictures and stories about the movies.  This is an exceptional collection and I ended up paying less than $10 per movie...I can't even go see a lousy new movie in a theater for $10 and these can be enjoyed for years...I feel this deserves 5 stars!

5089	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	When I first saw this film, I was literally shocked at the end. De Niro played a lonley, mentally disturb man extremely well. By the end of the film, we see the end result of Travis's mental prison. Travis worked as a taxi driver frequenting areas high in crimes, prostitution, sex, drug, and other oddities of our modern society. Throughout the film, we saw Travis transform from a lonely person who perhaps has communication issues to an obsession to end the life of a candidate. By the end of the film, Travis decides instead of killing a presidential candidate, he would save the life of a 12 years old girl imprisoned by her pimp to a life of prostitution. Armed with a 44 magnum and various other pistols, Travis went to the girl's pimp and ruthlessly, and violently, killed him and all those associated with the girl's imprisonment. At the end of the film, I was a bit confused. Travis is hailed as a hero by the news and everything was "back to normal" - Travis was back at his job as a taxi driver. The 12 years old girl apparently returned to her parents who thanked De Niro. I read over some theories about the ending and they are all plausible. As with all good endings to movies, it leaves the audience questioning what they saw rather than giving them a straight answer. I applaud the makers of the film for the ending that leaves you asking questions rather than finding answers.
In this new version of the tale Cyrano becomes C. D. "Charlie" Bales (Martin), a fire chief in a Colorado town who has a nose of epic proportions and no prospects in his love life.  But then who should come into town but,the fair Roxanne, (Daryl Hannah), who has rented a house to check out comets with her telescope.  He is totally smitten by her, but she only has eyes for Chris (Rick Rossovich), who is everything Charlie is not, to wit: handsome, stupid and lacking any social charm whatsoever.  Of course the centerpiece of the film is Martin's take on the famous balcony scene, where Charlie feeds Chris the lines with which to woo Roxanne, but that is not where this film finds its heart.

A minor point - there's a some debate as to whether the correct aspect ratio is 1:66
The rescue of the President, delegates and their families is breath-taking. Fortunately, some manage to jump with parachutes but there are not enough and time is running out ... Air Force One does not have the ability to land. There is a daring awe-inspiring rescue up in the air at 15,000 feet. General Alexander Radek is released from his prison cell, dressed in his well-decorated uniform as he walks across the prison courtyard ... and in the end, justice prevails. Viewing this film sends chills up and down one's spine because despite the many aspects of the film that are exaggerated - terrorism is one area that *thankfully* is *not* depicted in its true scope given what we know of the events of 9-1-1 and current Iraqi War.

Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, "The Original Star Trek Series" excepted, which has remained as timeless as "The Avengers". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.

1515	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	I have seen all the Jane Eyre versions and this one is by far the WORST of all of them! This is the only Jane Eyre version I would never own or buy or even want as gift. The acting was mediocre,not one of the best. Even the latest version that came out this year,that I thought was 'ok', was 100 times better than this one.  I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man. I didn't care much for this actress as Jane either or Adele. I think the dog Pilot was the best actor in this movie. I would not want this version even for free.
The action ride simply does not quit as it begins with the hijackers' takeover of Air Force One (with the help of a traitorous Secret Serviceman) and the President's apparent escape to Ford's battle to retake the plane and rescue his staff to a near-landing at Ramstein AFB in Germany to the in-air refueling to MiGs firing upon Air Force One to the final confrontation... nor like some films is the pacing flawed so that the watcher is drained or left wanting after the first few scenes; Air Force One simply keeps viewers on the edges of their seats for the entire film.

A word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn't give it a lot of expectations. I think there's a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer. I personally don't mind the sometimes grainy quality (plus the black and white of the first few episodes) because it gives it more vintage. What I do complain grievely about is the lack of subtitles; and, there's not much of a bonus feature.

This is my favorite of all the Rankin/Bass specials (and they are all excellent). Many people get all the "Animagic" cartoons confused...so I'll try to pinpoint this one. This is not the one with Rudolph ("...the Red-Nosed Reindeer") and not the one with the Heat Miser and Snow Miser ("Year Without A Santa Claus"). This is the one with the toy-hating Burgermeister Meisterburger and.....the Winter Warlock!!
What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).

The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).
This movie was in a Blockbuster $5 bin and it became such a 'cult' movie within my group of friends.  It was great seeing that other people had also the same feelings for this movie.
I was afraid it would not hold up.
Lisa Taylor at the time was about one of the most beautiful models in the early to later 1970's. I remember Darlanne Fleugel well (she was also in Crime Story in the late 1980s)but had never really connected her face with her name until now. Also you will see a young John Sahag, he plays a hairdresser in the movie. In real life he is one of the top hair stylists today, and is still cute with that shaggy hair and tight shirts!! He really hasn't changed!!!! It's these types of things that i like about the movie. The fashion, the music, the accessories, and even the wonderful STEIFF bear that is in the police precinct. He is sitting on the large table where Tommy Lee Jones conducts his investigations. You can see Lisa Taylor hugging the bear in another scene, and she doesn't want to let go.

Usually called "The original biker movie", Easy Rider is about two bikers from L.A. who take off on a cross-country trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. On the way, they make some new friends, one in particular named George Hansen played by Jack Nicholson, the "lawyer with the ACLU". Dennis Hopper won "Best New Director" at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this movie. This movie also introduced the world to 3 time Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson. Also, this film was the first film that featured actors smoking REAL marijuana on screen. Yes, they were actually stoned, believe it or not. The 35th anniversary DVD is a re-release of the 30th anniversary edition. The only difference is that it features the Easy Rider soundtrack on CD and contains the 80-page British Film Institute Modern Classic book "Easy Rider". The transfer is flawless, especially for a 60's film. The 30th anniversary DVD contains a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation with Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 soundtracks, and extras such as the documentary "Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage", and a commentary by Dennis Hopper. So, take it from me, a 16 year old film buff: This movie is a true classic, and a worthy addition for anyone's film collection.

Besson has always had a flair for visual artistry, and "The Messenger" is no exception. The imagery, assisted by veteran cinematographer Thierry Arboghast (who worked with Besson on "The 5th Element" and also served as Director of Photography for the lush "Ridicule), is rich, striking, captures the feel of the 15th century battlefield, and throws the viewer into battlefields and siege trenches fertilized with gore and muddy pastures turned into rancid abattoirs with the blood of the dead.

As close as the brothers are they are very different in many ways and you see this as the story progresses. Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer give excellent performances as the two brothers.

This is a super film to watch and grabs you in right from the beginning, it is top notch story telling at its finest.
2.  "Blazing Saddles" (1974) The three years before "Blazing Saddles" came out were lean years for Mel Brooks.

Michelle Rodriguez plays her usual "tough-gal" character (via "SWAT" and "GIRL FIGHT" among others) by the name of Rain Ocampo in this movie. Her equal balance of actual personality and granite type character plays off nicely with the character J.D (Pasquale Aleardi). The movie manages to be gruesome and bloody without crossing the "overkill" line (via all the other horror movies afterward, including the George A. Ramano movie remakes), it maintains the usual "jumpy scenes" common in a horror/action movie. And oddly enough, the music (done by the highly disagreed upon Marilyn Manson) suits this movie well, although there is a particular scene in which it begins to sound like a thousand bees buzzing in your ears. It plays off electronic/techo/rock tempo quite nicely for the movie without crossing the line also.

Finally, another strong point in this film is the cast of characters. Some have liked Mila's performance. Others have hated it while still others have excused her by saying she was just doing what she was told and that is why she sounds and often appears shrill and hysterical. Granted, she was not, at the time at least, the best or the most professional actor you could think of but she coul have done a lot worse. Other actors are probably much better in their roles, such as Vincent Cassel playing a yound Gilles the Rais or Tcheky Karyo in the role of Dunois, commander-in-chief of the Fenech army and the bastard son of the Duke of Orleans (and therefore the cousin of Charles, future Charles VII). The other actors playing the French captains are rather good also, in particular La Hire, historically known for always swearing and who, to avoid being told of by the young girl, did a huge effort not to swear when she was around, or Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, or the duke of Alenon. These hard and seasoned captains all somehow deferred to Jeanne, however grudgindly, and this is also rather surprising and interesting coming from them. All had much more experience than her. Some were even royal kins. Most behaved more like mercenaries, or at least warlords, happy to kill, burn, loot and rape, but their all obeyed her commands, at least to a certain extent. In itself, this is yet another hint that there was something extremely unsual with Joan of Arc, whatever version you chose to believe.

Girl's fatal flaw is that it can't decide if it is a comedy, a drama, or a coming-of-age story. Since the humor is confined to an occasional witty line it isn't much of a comedy, the only indication that it was meant to be a comedy is some over-the-top humor about an abusive jock being hit over the head with a board and knocked out. Once is not enough as this nonsense is repeated later in the film. Although not even remotely funny it must be there to let the viewer know that this is a comedy as there are never any consequences to those committing the criminal assault (insert "Three Stooges" here). The comedy aspect is finally abandoned and the last few minutes treat us to Lifetime triple feature of teen suicide, bulimia, and homosexuality. These are tacked on with insufficient explanation, apparently because the writer and director sensed that the comedy angle was weak and they needed to qualify it as a coming-of-age story.

When this film made its initial theater run in 1976, I was totally blown away (no pun intended!) by its unique cinematic style; a sort of introspective color noir dripping with modern operatic expressionism.  We experienced the salacious and gritty Big Apple street life from the cynical perspective of an alienated young cabbie--manifested through Paul Schrader's dark introspective first-person narrative, the sheen of Michael Chapman's surrealistic night cinematography, and Bernard Herrmann's alternately pensive and powerful scoring--brought together beautifully by director Martin Scorsese's obvious feel for the subject and milieu. It managed to strike a chord with many in the midst of the post-Watergate era...and unfortunately struck a wrong chord with a certain John Hinckley, but that's another story.

The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered "ugly." Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel.

After watching the DVD extras, (and there's a bunch), you get to see how much work the actors, stunt people, and effects people, went through to make this flick. Even the extras went to zombie school. The actors participated in hours of weapons and martial arts training. Milla Jovovich wanted to do the free fall stunt where her character, Alice, runs over 200 feet down the side of the Toronto City Hall building, but director Witt talked her out of it. A stuntwoman did the big drop. Milla does make the last 60 feet of the fall, which looked quite intense, herself. (I climb telephone poles for a living. 60 feet is high!!) The weapons are all real. The mini-gun that the Nemesis character uses in the film was custom made and brought down from it's original weight of over 100 lbs. to 70 lbs. for the actor William G. Taylor who stands over 6 foot 7. The first time he shot it, it actually knocked him back from the recoil. NOW THAT'S GETTING INTO THE ROLE, MAN. When you watch all the pieces that went into the making of the flick you'll realize what a labor of love it was for all of those involved. THANKS, GUYS. I LOVED IT!! I watched it back-to back. Once with the Widescreen and once with the Pan and Scan settings. THE DVD HAS BOTH. I understand Milla's commentary is funny. I haven't heard it yet. Her commentary on the first RE was hilarious.

Much of the humor is subtle.  Much of the humor requires knowledge of various subjects to understand the irony.  There have been quite a few articles and summaries written regarding the humor in this movie.  If you wish to catch every single joke you should seek these references because there are so many jokes that it is easy to miss some.  I still pick up on new ones each time I watch the movie.

An interesting detail for "The Lady In the Bottle" episode is that the videotape version features English subtitles as Jeannie, upon being released from her bottle, speaks to Captain Nelson in Persian (before Nelson wishes that she could speak in English - which she thankfully does!). However when this episode recently aired again on TVLand, there were no subtitles.

They can't quite get the criminal patter down and have eventually to revert to "Sir" and "please" and "I'm sorry" before they can complete their first robbery. When one of them is later used and betrayed, he doesn't want anyone to think that there are "any hard feelings." And when Anthony gives away the last of the money that they have stolen, Dignan can only scream "That's inappropriate!"--a sentiment and phrasing that are as harsh as it gets while delivered with the most profound sincerity.

1646	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I only saw a few episodes of Upstairs Downstairs when it first was broadcast in the U.S. all those years ago, but always wanted to see more. I finally bought the complete collection this past December and watched episodes daily until the end. I was not disappointed. What a delightful series this is, still as fresh and entertaining today as it was more than 40 years ago. I so enjoyed my little nightly sojourn into the lives of the Bellamys upstairs and Rose, Hudson, Mrs. Bridges,Edward, Ruby, etc. downstairs. If you like "period pieces", early 20th century history, wonderful character development, great acting, and good stories, you will love this series.
"Holy Grail" was the Pythons' first foray into feature-length films, save "Now For Something Completely Different," which was nothing more than selected comedy bits from the TV series, faithfully reproduced on a sound stage, without an audience in attendance. Here was the first "new" product since the TV show's end, and despite all the trouble they had making it, it is, in many ways, their best work. It is SO dense, so layered, and dutifully crafted, it proves the cast/writers were far from finished when they did, per se, finish their TV run as Monty Python.

8506	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Very good film - gritty atmosphere and good action scenes. Bronson has always been at his best with a director that knew how to use his estimable talents as an actor. You don't give him much to say and you let his physical presence carry the scene.
So if your expecting the movie to be the first game then your going to be disappointed. But remember it was never billed as being a movie based off the first game, instead it was billed as being a part of the franchise. This is what happened to the members of Umbrellas special unit. Several months after the events in the movie, the game begins.
"Gattaca" works mainly due to the enormously appealing central characters, namely Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law, without whom it would've been just another made-for-cable B-movie.  The script, camera work, film editing and set design are also quite good, which kept this film moving along briskly.
As everyone knows, there are two types of Blu-Ray editions of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". One is the 30th anniversary box set, which includes the three versions of the movie (Theatrical, Special Edition and Director's Cut) on one disc; a plethora of bonus features on the second; and a booklet (the 3-disc DVD version of the set contains one version on one disc each, a making-of documentary scattered on all the discs, and the rest of the bonus features on the director's cut disc). The other is the cheaper, newly released "Blu-Ray Essentials" version, which only contains the first disc of all the three versions but no booklet and zero bonus features (except for the Blu-Ray exclusive "A View from Above" feature, whose main purpose is to show viewers the difference between all three versions).
Overall, it you're into outdoors or climbing and want to learn from other's mistakes without making your own, this is a film to watch. What happens when arrogance replaces common sense? What happens when you don't obey your own rules?

  The characters are one dimensional and not very fun. Milla doesn't seem to comfortable in her role yet, but that changes in the second movie.

Two years after the horrible incident, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is back in college and is worse than ever having dreams about Ben Willis, the man who killed all her friends a couple of years ago. She gets comfort from a new friend named Will (Matthew Settle). Julie's other friend Karla (Brandy) tries to hook the two of them up and when she wins a trip to the Bahamas, she knows that it is perfect. But Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is still in the picture and Julie only goes as friends. Karla, her boyfriend Tyrell, Julie, and Will take flight right before Ray encounters the fisherman again. He tries to tell Julie not to leave but it is too late. Now in the Bahamas Julie is starting to lighten up and have fun. Then suddenly things start going terribly wrong when a storm hits the Island and people start to disappear. Ray takes a boat to the Island to warn Julie but will he make it on time to save Julie again from the fisherman?


This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful "My World is Beginning Today" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's "The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with "Put One Foot In Front of the Other" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.

Resident Evil in my opinion was a great movie. I enjoyed the plot, characters, and effects. The zombies looked very realistic and the movie was very creative.

The Tale of Sir Robin
Nicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much, was the product of a wealthy upbringing, but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed (in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him), never left the state line, and never lived life. He constantly used the expression, "I have always wanted to ...". How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a co-worker? If you always wanted to do it, why haven't you? So, here we have Hanson, dreaming a dream but never following through, who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites, but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking (driving most of the time) representations of the word "freedom". It is tragic what happens to Harmon, because he (unfortunately) experienced the negative side of freedom ... hatred and fear of the unknown.
Containing great scenes that still endure as massively quotable, (even non-Python fans have heard of them), this is definitely a must-have for anyone remotely interested in the work of Monty Python. The black knight at the bridge is still one of the funniest things I have seen, (I still kill myself laughing at it). The "anarcho-syndicalist" serfs, ("You can't expect to weild supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!" -- Dennis to King Arthur), were just a treat. Overall, it is a good whipping at anything concerning King Arthur and a host of other tales from the medieval period.

The film is based on the true story (reportedly much exaggerated, however) of Billy Hays [Brad Davis]. An American on vacation in Istanbul with his girlfriend Susan [Irene Miracle] in 1970, Billy Hays tries to smuggle a couple of kilos of hash back to the United States, only to get busted and sent, indefinitely, into a Turkish prison (the film single-handedly made "Turkish prison" synonymous with "living hell"). With the help of his father Mr. Hayes [Mike Kellin], in a fine performance of deeply felt frustration and an expensive lawyer, he gets a three-year sentence for possession, but fifty-three days from the conclusion of that term, a higher court overturns the sentence and instead finds him guilty of smuggling for a thirty-year stint. This is around the time he starts looking to escape, and by the time that fails, he has gone a little bit crazy.

2108	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I really like this film and will watch it again and again.  Harrison Ford plays a very determined President.  He's determined no to sit by and do nothing when terrorists destroy other countries; he is determined not to negotiate with terrorists; he is determined to save his family and other hostages when terrorists take over Air Force One; and very determined to get their leader off his ship and tells him so.  After that, he's determined to send as many as possible to safety before the ship breaks apart upon impact with the ocean.  He does accomplish his goals with the help of his cabinet via phone calls or fax machine when he is not dodging bullets in various parts of the plane.  Glen Close plays an equally determined Vice President trying to get all the hostages free and save President and his family.  Gary Oldman plays a terrorist leader who is determined to lead Russia into a new Golden Age of power and glory and plans to undermine the President's new policy of not negotiating with terrorists by threatening to kill his family.

Dignan recruits Anthony and Bob into his "team", brother figures. The film depicts Anthony's sibling and Bob's sibling, but never shows or mentions Dignan having siblings. Only child = loneliness.
5509	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	A few seconds after the first film concluded, this one takes off with Alice (Milla Jovovich) wandering a zombified city after some idiots from the Umbrella Corporation decide to reopen The Hive for a little peek.  Apparently, they couldn't trust the reports that told them they needed to keep that place locked tight, permanently.  With the zombies taking over, the EVIL villain in charge (Thomas Kretschmann as Major Cain) decides to seal off the city and destroy it with a nuclear missile, then call it an accident, despite film footage stating otherwise.  Can the last few survivors manage to get out in time and in one piece?  And exactly just what is Program Alice?
But the main focus of the film is the relationship between Sally Field and Julia Roberts, a domineering mother and her strong-willed but physically weak daughter respectively, the latter also plagued with diabetes. And there is a lot of time spent on Daryl Hannah's strange character development as well as the film covers a year or two via holidays.
-Leads. I don't know who looks better but both Sienna and Milla light up the screen with their beauty. Took some realism away form the movie, but in all honesty I can't complain.
And all this for love ! (go figure ... real Dostoevsky !) To set free woman from this servile leech called man.

That was until the head of the department of space travel is found murdered. After a Detective (Elias Koteas) is put on the case he threatens to expose Vincent for who he is.  Uma Thurman does a great job as Irene, a fellow employee at Gattaca who befriends Vincent and understands him more than he knows.  Jude Law to me is who steals the show proving that he is as acclaimed as he is for a reason.  Excellent story line and execution that raises this film to the next level.  This film carries a ring of truth as new procedures are already making this possible.  As of now parents can go as far as to pick the color of their child's eyes, hair, his likes and dislikes.  With everything in the hands of the parents, nothing to chance, it's taking us so far from where we were meant to be.  What ever happened to accepting what God provides?  What ever happened to loving your children for who they are and not who you made them?

A positive is the characters. There interaction is the only  thing that interested me at all. Besides that, the way the director  constantly tried to lead you into beleiving something was going to happen,  then it not happening, then happening a couple of seconds later was  irritating and uneventful. Someone was trying too hard.
Looking forward to a blu ray of this some day or even a 4K version. This movie is made for "watching", pick your own ending. Geez.......
I can't recommend this classic enough. But first, let me say this, many people don't seem to care much for their sometimes very dry humor.

The thing that bothered me most (and perhaps that was Scorsese's intent) is the amoral ambivalence Scorsese presents here.  Politicians are bland and interchangeable, uttering empty platitudes, government is the problem and the solution, Travis is a psycho and a hero.  The movie is fairly drenched in shades of gray rather than the moral certainties of black and white - and perhaps that's Scorsese's intention.  "Taxi Driver" was a departure from the Hollywood oeuvre that came before it with obvious heroes and villains.  The end result is a movie that unsettles and causes us to question the nature of good and evil.
The movie is very well directed and written.  It is beautiful, dark, and haunting.  Disturbing as it may be, the story has such realism to it.  Robert De Niro outdoes himself in this film.  You can sense his drifting into madness so clear that it's scary.  They could have not achieved this goal if they had casted someone else for the role.

I like Sci fi movies but many just get too strange and just too unreal. This was more of a Sci fi mixed with drama. So it had it's futuristic twist to it but added more to it to make it more enjoyable for me. If you have Prime, deff worth a free watch.
When I was watching the film, you can tell how special and how unique the film truly was.  It's one thing to have a motorcycle road film and showcasing the allure of someone that can be seen as an outlaw but in this film, it truly is a time capsule as we are watching something that captures America during that time.  From recreating the hippie commune of New Buffalo (in New Mexico) of many hippie men and women with kids all over the place to capturing that Southern feel towards hippies and men in leather (the guys weren't gay but because of they were outside of the norm of that area, they were considered offensive) and of course, the music, the motorcycles, the drug use.  That's the late 60's.

But before I scare off you simpler types, let me add that I've watched this with my 12 year-old nephew and he thought it was hilarious. That's another thing; this film does not warrant an 'R' rating. Doesn't now and certainly didn't back then, which makes me wonder what sort of gits were sitting on the panel of the MPAA at the time (as opposed to the silly twits sitting on it now).

With an allstar cast, from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close as the Vice Prfesident who shows a little more levelheadedness than some of the other staff members, Xander Berkeley, Gary Coleman, Paul Guilfoyle, and William H. Macy, this is a well-acted, well-plotted movie which will leave the audience breathless. Fox TV called it a "wild ride," and it's that in more ways than one, especially the plane-to-plane rescue scene. The special effects are great.

Sure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.

Billy's girlfriend Susan, who joins him in a half-baked scheme to smuggle moderate quantities of hashish out of Istanbul, is played by the incredible Irene Miracle.  A year or so later she was to come into her element fully as Rose Elliot in Argento's masterful INFERNO, but here she is more subdued, though still ravishingly beautiful.  She and Brad Davis have got to be the hottest couple ever put on film.  Of course their love gets torn apart once the jail portion of the movie begins, around reel 3.  Giorgio Moroder, whose soundtrack is one of the epochal moments of 1970s cinema, wrote a beautiful love theme for Billy and Susan, it is tender and filled with longing and frustration.  Sometimes I hear that theme played even on elevator Muzak and even now it brings back all the sorrow of lovers violently parted from each other, like Nino Rota's theme from the Zeffirelli ROMEO AND JULIET.

3425	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is one of those movies you never get tired of watching. I've only watched the original, but I will get around to the other versions one of these days.
That being said, this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever put into a film and is very quotable. My wife and I find ourselves saying, "It's not the real grail?", "I shall taunt you a second time", "One, two, five...", and oh so many others as the occasion fits. We have not allowed our children to watch it, so the quoting is fairly annoying to them, but sooner or later they will watch it and "get it", just not with me.
I would recommend this movie to anyone, who are like-minded.
Perhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes ("Bum Voyage" and "Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.
8403	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	This travesty ranks right up there with such notably disastrous stage to screen transfers such as A Chorus Line, Mame, Man of La Mancha, Hello Dolly, Camelot, South Pacific just to name a few.  The sad thing here is this could have been an extraordinary classic movie musical considering how wonderful the original stage version was.  It's as if the producers and director got together to purposely turn this into a cheap, ugly sideshow.  Nothing, absolutely nothing works.  The added songs are unbelievably bad, the choreography is appalling!  Did you notice the dance number in Warbucks house where you can see the girls underwear during some of the kicks? Shocking!  Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett are rediculous due to bad writing and direction.  Aileen Quinn is about as likable as watching OJ Simpson on the golf course.  I remember when I saw this film in the theatres when it first came out and sitting there with my mouth open in disbelief.  What can you say about a director who takes the most popular song in the show and only uses it over the main title?  Thank God John Huston did not direct any other musicals!  I am not too keen on the Disney version either but it is far superior to this garbage. And it is on Blu Ray no less,  what a waste!

5008	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	"Taxi Driver" is a psychological thriller film where the viewer stands in the shoes of deluded Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro. Bickle presents as a social misfit who is looking for a job to fill his sleepless nights. His reality is certainly skewed as he takes a potential girlfriend, Betsy, to a pornographic movie screening as a first date. From Bickle's point of view the decay of society surrounds him, and he seeks to rid the city of seedy elements. Iris, a child prostitute, becomes a reason for him to carry out his plan, and she in many ways is an important focus in his life. De Niro convincingly plays Bickle with a deadpan persona that is driven purely by an invented concept of right and wrong.

Most of the elements of Resident Evil you may have seen in better movies ,but it does grow on you. Resident Evil, one of the most popular playstation games ever, has now been given the big screen treatment in this Big, Buff, and gory flick. Even though it lacks plot and characterization and it is not as gross as the video games and still is the best 2hrs of entertainment you will ever have. Using material from movies like Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, and Aliens(All Highly Recommended) Resident Evil will make you jump, scream, laugh, and hurt your ear drums with its driving load soudtrack. Special Effects are dazzling and is as fun as a 3 ring circus,this film is full of the big budget studio entertainment you see constantly in scifi/horror movies today. So for those nerds out their (like me!) who love scifi conventions, and dig (NO-BRAINER) zombie flicks this is the one to see!!! I think fans of the video games will not be too disappointed do to their dissisions to not use Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield from the original video game and not using the plotlines from the game as well. Anyways the bottom line is : Loud, fast, scary, and gross sells and is the amount of jolt Resident Evil has to offer for Horror junkies!

When it comes to purchasing a film for viewing, there are any number of criteria: the artistic achievement of the film (e.g., MOULIN ROUGE), the extent to which the story is compelling (e.g., JAWS), how well the story is told (e.g., CLUELESS), and the psychological impact the film will have on the viewer (e.g., THE EXORCIST). Notice how the cited examples (I chose some obvious ones) arguably only satisfy one or two of these specific criteria.
In steps our protagonist, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), who is a naturally birthed man who still has dreams.  He was supposed to have died of a weak heart, per his DNA mapping, but he hasn't yet and wants to get into Gattaca and fly away to outer space.  But his dream is barred by his genetic deficiencies, until he meets with Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) who has perfect genetics but has been left a paraplegic from an accident.  Freeman assumes Morrow's identity with some subterfuge and the two work together to help Freeman sidestep Gattaca's screenings so he can get into the program and further his way toward his dreams.  There's genuine tension as Freeman must scrub his body of excess dead skin, hair that will fall out, use blood and urine sacs to avoid detection of his true (and supposedly inadequate) persona and this portion of the film is exciting and intriguing especially as his life gets more complicated when someone gets whacked in the Gattaca program and the detectives begin hunting for the culprit.  The police use genetic screening methods and they come closer and closer to catching Freeman who is now barely slipping by them, even while he has developed a risky relationship with Irene (Uma Thurman), and his world begins to fall apart and his dream is threatened.  The denouement of the movie which finds Freeman willing to risk it all (I won't ruin it, it's kind of cool I think for those who haven't seen it) is a worthwhile comment on the film's critical evaluation of what constitutes the human spirit and freedom.

9342	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	The picture quality is sharp and in excellent color. There are several tracks of commentary. The sound is as clear and impressive as it can be. The special features are outrageous, sometimes as funny as the film itself. There is a contemperary documentary on the film, trailers, a look back at the locations of the film, new spoofs, and some rather odd features, such as a bit of Japanese language footage and a version of "Knights of the Round Table" in - Lego? This dvd set is crammed to the gills with bonus goodies, but the core material of the dvd, that is, the movie, is itself excellently tranferred and done with obvious care and concern.

The ending is fascinating.  Is it real or a fantasy?  The clippings of newspaper articles, as the camera scans across the board, say Travis is dead, and then later that he is comatose, but recovering.  I suspect that the ending is a dream, the hallucination of a dying man who has his nobility vindicated in the end by appreciative parents and a city that needs more men like him.

The story centers around Norm Mclean, his brother Paul-a sort of Cain and Able pair.  Using rich detail the movie explores Norm's relationships with his family, future wife, and future in-laws in a manner all can identify with.  Through it, is fly fishing, the one activity that unites Norm with his father and brother in a way like no other.  It is different than the book in that the events in the book play out when the Mclean brothers are much older men-Norm is married with children and has a career in Illinois.  In the movie, Norm is just out of graduate school, only courting Jessie, and in a younger phase of life.  This altered detail gives the movie a much greater emotional impact than the book.
Here's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go "Ohhhhh!!"?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!

All the worse for Vincent (Ethan Hawke), who was born of parents who, romantically, wanted a naturally conceived rather than a genetically engineered baby. So he is born an "in-valid", with flawed genes, and finds the way to his dream, becoming a space traveller, blocked before he has even started on it. Yet, out in the sea on one of his swimming contests against his genetically superior brother, he finds that he is not necessarily the loser every time. So he decides to pursue his dream against all odds. Through will power, stamina, and the help of a shadowy middle man who makes a living supplying in-valids with a valid identity, Vincent gets where he wants to be, and where we find him at the beginning of the movie. He borrows the identity of a crippled swimmer, played by Jude Law. Their mutual dependency results in surprising insights for both, and some tensions as well; - especially when, in the wake of a murder case, Vincent finds his true identity on the verge of being revealed. At the same time, falling in love with his co-worker Irene (Thurman), he has a hard time matching up the required sincerity with his fake identity.

Parts of "Take the Money and Run" are as hysterical as "Sleeper," such as the shot where his gun turns to soap suds and when he morphs into a Rabbi.  Also of note is when he poses as a classical musician but can't place the name of Mozart.  This is happy, loose camp in the spirit of the Marx Brothers.  Rent it, buy it, do whatever, you can't go wrong with this one.  It's good clean fun.
Peter tries to enlist the aid of an old horror movie host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), the vampire killer, but he thinks Charley is crazy too.  Eventually they all try to humor him by going to the house to meet the new resident Jerry Dandridge played by chris Sarandon.  It's all kind of a joke to everyone until Vincent looks in his little mirror and sees that Dandridge does not cast a shadow.  With the realization that Dandridge really is a vampire Vincent wants to flee the town.  Meanwhile the vampire now comes after Charlie and his friends, kidnapping Amy and taking her to his old, gothic looking Victorian.  Charley now has to rescue Amy and figure out a way to stop the Vampire and his servant Billy Cole.
DeNiro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam Marine vet, off kilter but moral, who is sickened by the crime, drugs and immorality of 1970s New York City, seen from the taxi he drives night and day. He has an ill-fated fling with a pretty campaign worker (Cybil Shephard), goes off the deep end and portrays himself as a possible assassination threat to a Presidential candidate, although this is never fleshed out. In the end, he commits an act of vigilantism to save the life of a teenage prostitute with potential (Jodie Foster), and like in "Death Wish" (Charles Bronson), is made a hero.

Rumpole (McKern) is the highlight of the show. his wit, his personality. all of it is a pure joy to watch. these episodes are half mystery and half court room drama. at times the truth comes out, and Rumpole is able to pierce the vail and find the truth. two full seasons occur before Rumpole is persuaded to retire. but then come the tv movie. Rumpole's Return. where even he can not stay on vacation for long. the lure of the Old Baily calls and he is back in action again. then we return for five more series in all. all in all it is a delight to watch. I can not overstate just how well McKern does in this series. it is a joy to watch.

As a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of "patriotism."
The extras are very nice, especially the BBC "Film Night" footage and a new segment with Palin and Jones revisiting the castle site on which the movie was filmed.  The extra audio track with Cleese, Palin, and Idle is amusing and interesting, definitely something that fans will want to hear.  The audio track with the two directors (Gilliam and Jones) predictably drags a bit by comparison.

Air Force One  starring Harrison Ford is one of my favorite movies for all the wrong reasons.
The film comes to life in the acting talents, especially that of Brad Pitt.  Pitt has so much charisma and charm, and it is a beautiful thing when a character comes along that allows him to embrace that part of himself while still adding depth to the role.  The 90's were a good decade for Pitt (between `Thelma and Louise', `A River Runs Through It', `Legends of the Fall', `Seven' and `Fight Club' the man had a ridiculous string of success), in fact he may be the biggest star of the 90's.  What he does here, in `A River Runs Through It', is beautiful.  Taking the rebellious streak of Paul and giving it the angst and painful remorse needed to make him relatable and human, Pitt creates a memorable character who outlives the film itself.
No, this isn't the "thinking man's Joan" by a looooong  shot. The film is irritatingly anachronistic (see "whatever"),  and crippled by  hopelessly befuddled motivations and seriously  one-dimensional acting by people who should know better AND by the lead,  but in her case, being the director's current "significant other"  must have gone a long way. Besson's fans will appreciate the cinematography  and the hyper-kinetic pacing of so many scenes, but those with a taste for  subtlety, or serious philosophic enquiries, or even historical accuracy  will find the two and a half hour length about an hour too long.
"Air Force One" in particular is excellent.

He is not tall enough, his vision is not good enough, so he is "invalid". Nevertheless, he is determined to enter the space navigator academy (Gattaca) by using a false identity.

At the very end before the flight, his true identity is discovered by one doctor, but the doctor sympatshises with his dreams and allows him to fly in space.

"Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  While the film slightly has that aged '80s film look, outdoor scenes look vibrant, Annie's red dress to anything with bold colors tend to really pop.  And you can see the stubble of Albert Finney's bald head.  But for the most part, this is probably the best that anyone is going to see of "Annie".  I didn't notice any artifact problems or severe DNR.  There was a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the film does look on Blu-ray.

This story of joan of arc is so moving and heroic. It would be a shame not to share this movie with friends. Mila serves up an incredible gut-gripping performance, and the supporting cast does not disappoint either! Anyone who disapproves of this film confuses me, and leads me to think that they are not interested in the history and the passion of this story in general. This movie is one version of many story-tellers' visions of what Joan's voyage was really like. Of course there will be many opinions on the final outcome of this movie. But to me, this is one beautifully constructed piece of art. The Messenger has very quickly become one of my all-time favorites films. Beautiful. Brava!

As a boy I watched this on TV and this was not long after Henry Winkler ended his career as the Fonz.  Personally i think he should have made a bigger career as an actor but i assume he may have been type casted and thus shortened his acting future.
 Which, alongside Joan's motivation in this script ( Her sister's been raped by the posse of --er I mean the Brits) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest. It's 'The Quick and the Dead' minus gunslingers, set in 1429. Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions' are gorgeously photographed.

The IRONY is that it could so easily have gone the other way.  What would he have been if he'd managed to hit the politician?  Had it gone as he'd originally planned, he'd certainly have been nothing less than the 'trash' he despised - from any rational person's point of view.  How much of what we do is up to chance, luck, or as fate would have it?  The movie seems to unconsciously ask this question.  Travis is a 'walking contradiction'.  He hates the scum, the sickos, the perverts, but finally, it's only a stroke of fate that distinguishes him from them.
The Hive and its environs are so brilliantly executed that Anderson effectively creates another character in the set-pieces alone, from the parquet and marble digs of the Mansion to the sleek, techno-sexy sterility of the Hive, to the goth-industrial Road-to-Nowhere that is the train---all of this adds to the horror and frame the desperation of our heroes as they war against the Living Dead (the train station and Hive Entrance being an actual underground system in Berlin!). Few films manage to bring everything together like "Resident Evil", and Anderson is to be commended in making it all work out in spades.
6708	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a "grown up". I don't want to see Englishmen, Americans and French themselves playing French in a movie describing history facts, we can not find THE REASON France fought with England when those emotions has been confused a lot. Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend "Beatrice" and "the ninth gate"(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course. I don't know how successful the two movies are, in trying to touch the thought of God, since I myself do not really understand God and find it is hard to understand a little more; at least I am sure they are closer than this one.
Well these questions are not  really answered in this melodrama because Ben/Sam becomes less the focus of  the story.  Actually the director goes all over the place patching up story  leaks with quaint little fixes that are reminiscent of Sit coms.  I felt  this plotline belonged more on "Growing Pains" than on the silver  screen.  The worst part of the movie comes at the end when George suddenly  lets Ben/Sam go "home" and Ben/Sam suddenly feels that the  Cappadora's are his real family.  This is after Beth lets him go and  Vincent is a real jerk to him.  It is a cop-out ending IMO.

37 years after 'Easy Rider' was first shown, I viewed the movie again. I was prepared to think I remembered the story, the story of an American myth, with anitheroes riding from the West only this time on bikes into the evil of middle America. I thought the best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was an important film but not a very good one. Then I watched it, and I was hooked from scene one. The film drew me in, such a very good film. Not perfect but very good. Dennis Hopper's character,was so real, the dishelveled, long-haired. I remember many people who dressed and acted just like him. He directed the film and gave the character's names Wyatt and Billy, old west names discovering new territory. The acting was natural, not self-conciuous. It covers alot of territory in 90 plus minutes. The landscapes so beautiful and unspoiled. The surprises were the fact that Phil Spectre was cast as the connection- how trite and real is that? The early scene with the rancher and his family was one of the beautiful scenes of the film. Wyatt tells the rancher: "It's not everyman who can live off the land, you know, doing his own thing his own time. You should be proud."
If you like stories about freedom this is for you.  To paraphrase Jack Nicholson 'Lots of people like to talk about freedom but they don't want anybody living it'.  Its a sometimes surreal adventure, but it makes its points well.
  This had everything for me: Zombies, those vicious killer dogs, and the oh-so-awesome licker! The opening segment that explains how the T-Virus gets released was handled exceptionally well, I thought. And the ending? A perfect set-up for the sequel which, to be quite honest, I absolutely cannot wait to see. If the "Nemesis" is anything near to what he is in the "Resident Evil 3" game, that movie will be just as good-(if not better)-than this one.

But there are objective things to legitimately castrate this movie.  The biggest problem with the movie is that it's aimless.  The Spice Girls were setting up for a concert, they had a convenient pregnant best friend to chat with, their agent was pushing them to work hard and not have fun, and a tabloit journalist hired a sleazy paparazzo to tarnish the band because he's bored.  Everything else is practically plotless, just random scenarios that segue into other random scenarios.  They sing in different places, they meet celebrity cameos, they go on a photo shoot, two American studio execs are pitching a Spice Girls movie out of the blue, they ride on sport boats with their contest-winning fangirls, they were in a military dance camp with a stern gestappo instructor, and they were discovered by an alien race who loved their music.  There's no connection with each of these scenarios, the randomness of the goofball situations is akin to "Family Guy".  It also means these situations are practically idiotic in direction, if not just wordy whenever the girls just run their months about stuff only pre-teens would get into.
6794	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	RESIDENT EVIL is one of those movies you go into knowing that you won't get much out of other than a little dumb fun.  Unfortunately, you don't get much of that here either, thanks  to a razor-thin plot and alot of idea-snatching from superior films. The plot revolves around a company called the Umbrella Corporation, which does illegal viral research in an underground facility called the Hive, which in turn is monitored by an artificial intelligence component called the Red Queen.  After  a security breach, the Red Queen activates a defense mechanism in which all the Hive employees are trapped and summarily killed in the facility.  At this point a tactical unit is dispatched to investigate, and that's where the so-called fun begins.  Again, a movie like this is never known for its' character development or acting range, in which case Milla Jovovich acquits herself admirably in the lead role, looking sufficiently (hacked) off when the scene calls for it.  Michelle Rodriquez does another one of her always-looks-mad-as-hell routines, which seems to be all she's good for and is frankly getting tiresome in every movie that she's in.  All in all, video game afficionados would be better served renting TOMB RAIDER or even one of the MORTAL KOMBAT films. For typical movie-goers, I'd say pass.

Plot, sphlot. This is survival horror cinema, so one shouldn't expect too much verisimilitude or texture. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE was designed with crunching zombie kills and gory special effects in mind. Sexy Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr step into the fray as two uber-capable action heroes in their own right. But Milla Jovovich owns this franchise, and she again lends her fantastic looks and her palpable physicality. Milla is fearless when it comes to committing to her action sequences, and she performs a lot of her own stunts, including rappelling 60 feet down the side of a high rise edifice. She really anchors the film, drives most of the spectacular action set pieces.

So, when the two are released, they head out to New Orleans but what they don't expect is that what may have seem like freedom so far, until they hit certain areas they learn that people's perception of them are different.

Most movies I have watched have had boring periods when you just wanted to fast forward -- but the plot of  "Girl" moved right along.  I always enjoy movies like this one, where the characters are changing and developing.  For me, the treatment of how girls become "women" was actually insightful.

Finally, film for film and despite a couple of misfires in an otherwise exemplary rsum, there was at one point nobody better in the Action movie business than John McTiernan, and after a string of cranking out three of the most successful Action films of all time, the Director proved himself abundantly capable of delivering what was and still arguably is the quintessential Action spoof film in Last Action Hero. Starring history's biggest Action hero and delivering a fun and magical plot that perfectly intermixes general parody of the Action movie business, Last Action Hero makes for an infinitely re-watchable picture for Action and Arnold Schwarzenegger fans alike. Sony's Blu-ray release, however, is rather tepid, featuring a fairly decent 1080p picture quality, a booming lossless soundtrack, and next to no extras. Recommended for diehard fans of the film, but for more casual viewers should wait for, hopefully a special edition at some point in the future will be released, I hope so. Despite it being slightly a disappointing film, that should have been better, I am still glad I have got this in my Blu-ray Collection, as I am really keen to build up an extensive Arnold Schwarzenegger Blu-ray Collection.

Some of the funniest scenes involve Tom Skerritt as Sally Field's husband Drum.  Tom seems to have a way of doing things that provide at least smiles, and a bit of eye rolling on occasion.  Tom is funniest when he interacts with Shirley MacLaine.  Tom seems to enjoy tormenting Shirley and Shirley enjoys griping back at Tom.  While on one level it appears that the two dislike each other, the viewer also must recognize that they could have avoided each other and yet do not, so surely they must get some enjoyment out of the encounters.

Let's face it, regardless of which Brooks' movies you prefer....You will NEVER get a bad one & ALWAYS laugh with any of his movies.  And with this set, no matter how many times you watch ANY of these films, they will always be as funny, if not funnier, as the first time you watch them.
The story concerns one Virgil Starkwell, a bespectacled failure who resorts to crime for a living, and can't even be a success at that. He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says "I have a gub" or "I have a gun". It's told partly in a spoof-documentary style that foreshadows Allen's later full-blown mockumentary, Zelig (1983).

Franchises like The "X-Files" and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today's standards.

Not only funny, but essential for human survival. The extra stuff is most excellent. Michael Palin and Terry Jones go to the film sites and buy their own script at one castle and revisit the bridge of peril. We even get Lego Knights, and its a funny as it sounds.

The film lets Travis Bickle speak & act for himself.  It's non-judgemental and non-exploitive, a fact that might make people  uneasy. Sure he's not right and sure he'll do it again, but that's the  point. There are many, many Travis Bickles out there. Travis flipped out,  and he will flip out again. And the reason why is answered by the newspaper  clipping towards film's end. The most disturbing thing, might be, in the  end, you love Travis. He has done wrong, very wrong things, but you love  him anyway, and actually agree with what he does to rescue Jodie Foster's  character.

This movie has made several lists of the greatest comedies of all times.  Yet, not every one thinks the movie is funny.  People who like the Monty Python television shows, who like British humor in general, and prefer wry or ironic humor will find this movie funny.  Forget about slapstick.  This movie has very little slapstick.  Occasionally the jokes fall flat.  However, when the jokes work, they are hilarious.  Countless numbers of people have repeated the jokes from "The Holy Grail" in the three decades plus since the original release of the movie.

The story about a man drowning in loneliness that desperately seeks the approval of the social lives of those around him. He is Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), who (as the film opens) gets a job as a cabbie because of the insomnia he suffers of. He prefers working nights (12 hour shifts), will take anyone anywhere, and still he can't seem to sleep. His point-of-view is an ingenius cinematic approach whereas it is viewed in slow-motion (which symbolizes his heightened observation). There are so many undercurrents within the film that even Bickle himself doesn't realize. There is an apparent prejudice against african-americans (the usual stereotype of them all being pimps or drug dealers - and ironically enough when Bickle finally does meet a pimp, he turns out to be white).

Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film, I felt that Hopper (who also directed) knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.

Resident Evil was rated R for "Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity." Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is "Language." I recall but one "F" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the "Strong Violence" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, "the blood coagulates only after the body is dead." Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.

At its heart, the story (and probably this is just my interpretation) is about Solitude and one mans search purpose to his existence. De Niro stars as a Taxi Driver, drifting mostly, searching for a cause to hook himself to. But he also seems like your typical slightly-above-intelligence guy who tires of his purpose and explains it away or does something about it. So he's in the army and leaves, and has strange quirks like being unable to sleep much. He decides to date Cybill, campaign for the presidential candidate, rescue a child-prostitute, dream himself as a secret agent on an important mission etc. The movie is sometimes hilarious, especially when De Niro's character shaves his head as a punk and attempts to pursue the cause of cleaning-up-society.
1382	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	I knew I had to see it as I am a fan of the TV series.  It's almost as if the writers watched a few old episodes, picked up a few ideas and threw them into the script.  Absolutely NOTHING worked, the daft things Steed did (like the tea making  in the car) worked in the TV show because it was done with style; in the  film it came over as  pathetic.  Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg; she can't  act and was totally inept.
The video transfer would also be hard to improve as crisp details, even in the shadows, are most apparent.  The only thing lacking in this Blu-ray version is an almost complete lack of extras.  There is a commentary extra but these are most ubiqutious and that's about all.  There are a couple of movie previews on the disc.  I hate to pay for a company's advertising and wish they had used that space for any extras that could have been there instead.
DeNiro and Scorsese have created a masterful picture.  I was completely drawn into Travis Bickle's life and his desperate sense of lonliness.  His hope of emerging from his seclusion and desperation at being unable to do so are carried in every frame.  This is a movie that will stay with you for years.
9159	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	At first I didn't think I would actually like this movie. I had never actually seen the film before this year, and a friend recommended it to me. Well when I saw some guy pretending to ride a horse in the opening scene I thought for sure this movie had no chance. I was wrong. The dialogue is clever, funny, and it only gets better everytime I see it. The first time through I thought it was OK. As I've seen it a few times now its better everytime. I haven't seen anything else by these guys. Maybe it time I checked out some of their other work. It is easy to see why many view this movie as a classic. It truly is one of a kind.

"A classic...a great film for its day...everyone is sure to love it", those were the comments I had been hearing about Easy Rider before I rented it. I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read.

This film is a piece of excellent art rather than a "movie". The Direction from Scorsese once again is masterfull, the cinematography is one of the many treasures that can be found in this film. The wonderful score fits perfectly with the narration and imagery. Robert De Niro is absolutely brilliant in this, he does a wonderful job that is the disturbed Travis Bickle, but the rest of the cast shouldn't be overlooked as well, the characters are excellently played by Foster as the prostitute Iris, Keitel as the pimp 'Sport', Shepherd as Betsy, and Brooks as Tom. The characters are superbly written by the screenwriter Paul Schrader
If you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's "Jane Eyre," watch the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version  which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester. Zelah Clarke plays Jane perfectly as unworldly and innocent and knowing her "station" so to speak, but also having her own mind. The 83' version wasn't Hollywood's version, it was Bronte's version.

6811	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	If you are even remotely a Sinatra fan, or a fan of Rodgers & Hart, you will love this movie. The music is terrific, Sinatra is perfectly comfortable in the role of a womanizer!  The cinematography is excellent  (DVD highly recommended) and it was filmed on location in beautiful 1957  San Francisco.  It's also very romantic and Sinatra is truly seductive.  He  never looked better than in this film - this is the swingin' 50's Sinatra  with the tilted hat, at (one of) the height(s) of his career.  If choosing  between the VHS or DVD, definitely go with the DVD!  Not a masterpiece,  but again, if you like Sinatra and/or Rodgers & Hart, it IS a  masterpiece.  Novak & Hayworth are great, too. The only down side is it  had to be sanitized quite a bit from the stage play due to 1950's film  standards.  Still, it's very sexy for 1957. Includes the great  "Bewitched" & "My Funny Valentine".

3049	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I love the actors in this movie.  This movie is a timeless classic that I repeat from time to time.
Bronson especially, is given one of the finest roles of his twilight career. He's a man of few words, riding the rails looking to make a buck in bare knuckle fighting. We never really know his past, with his screen persona filling in the gaps. That's a fault. And yet like a ghost, he silently moves in and out of the shadows of New Orleans creating a fiercely independent character we would want on our side. Coburn, as usual, is terrific as the conman who bankrolls Bronson. He's a fast talker, eventually too fast for his own good. Martin, one of the finest character actors in history, is nothing short of brilliant as the cut man struggling with the dark addictions of life. These three characters are going nowhere, but for a brief moment as a team, they buck a corrupt and brutal system.
 This is a classic series.  One of the best series I have seen.  It is historically correct.  The content and acting is first rate.  Technically the sound is sometimes difficult to follow.  This series deserves a five star rating.  It is indeed a classic.  The addition of Thomas & Sarah is indeed a great bonus.  Please don't miss it!!!!!!!

It's not a terrible film and a viewer who hasn't read "Into Thin Air" or "The Climb" may find it superficially enjoyable.

Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle a recently discharged Marine who is looking for work and lives a very odd and secluded life as well as having sleep problems he's down and out but manages to find a job as a "Taxi Driver" The odd hours and late nights suit Travis, but he meets a local political campaign worker whom he soon becomes somewhat obsessed with (Cybill Shepherd who plays the part of Betsy)
5.  "High Anxiety" (1977) This is Brook's homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. It's fun to see if you can pick out the specific scenes which are a take on a Hitchcock scene. As I love Hitchcock, this raised "High Anxiety" to 4 stars for me.

Tavis Bickle, a taxi driver and volunteer for a New York City political campaign, has tried it all. He's attempted doing things the right way, treating people with kindness and women with respect. Nevertheless, he is ignored and his chivalrous advances continually stepped upon or altogether discarded by one person after another. It is when Tavis realizes that he will forever be average and overlooked that he decides to make drastic changes in his world. Almost at once he begins driving the most dangerous portions of New York in his taxi, scouring the nighttime landscape with his mind cultivating a solution to his own personal, dark problems. Soon, his decision becomes conclusive: he will become a vigilante, and his first offering to the world will be in aiding a young teenaged prostitute by providing her a way out, no matter what it may cost Tavis personally in the process.

The music is top-notch (although I'm still wondering why their cover of "Leader Of The Gang" seen in the film remains unreleased), and the acting is well done (in a sort of inexperienced Beatles / A Hard Day's Night sort of way).  No, it's not an Oscar contender, but is is fun.  As a former fan of the group (I gave up when Geri Halliwell left - she was my favorite) I recommend Spice World to anyone who wants to have a good time.  It's fun!

2030	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I really like this movie.  It is a classic in Harrison Ford's filmography.  Gary Oldman is the perfect villain - he has been for over the last 10-15 years it seems like minus his role as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films.  Ford is great as usual, the likable badass president. Who can forget the classic line from this movie:  "Get off my plane!"
This is a Sci-fi classic made great by the story, the actors, the cinematography, almost everything comes together for this movie.  No need for ridiculous special effects.  The key that makes this movie great is the story that is almost prophetic, coupled with the great acting and film-making.
....A.  Director's Commentary. (no subtitle for commentary) Re-watch the movie with Mel Brooks telling stories and explaining filming decisions. I enjoy film commentaries and this one did not disappoint. Brooks brings up casting and B&W lighting, music and pauses and inflection for effect. Above all, the sets and lighting: "The camera-work had to marry the material."

As with the extras, there's plenty to keep you happy. The first disc contains two fun commentary tracks by the Pythonites themselves and a Pop-up video track for storyboard comparisons.
They bring in Nemesis, what I consider the ULTIMATE bad guy in the classic Resident Evil 3 game.  While extremely dangerous and intimidating in the video game, he does nothing but plod along in a slow moving way in the movie.  He's still relatively cool I suppose, with the ability to detect those who are armed and pose a threat to him which is a fascinating feature, and of course, his trusty rocket launcher is as explosive in the movie as it is in the game (of course it is- Hollywood can smell a perfect opportunity for special effects and the rocket launcher surely satisfies in that regard).  However, in the game (as Jill) you had to REALLY move your legs as quickly as possible or you'd get caught.  He's not fast enough in the movie so everyone can easily run away from him.  Cool looking, but lacking speed.  This is a vital and distinct feature that's missing.

Thanks to Sony for giving us such a great version of this oft maligned film.  My biggest complaint is that they didn't put chapter stops at the beginning of the songs, which should be standard practice for any Blu-ray musical!

CONCLUSION: It great to finally see this show get the treatment it deserves with this Complete Series DVD release. The packaging, tasteful and consistent menus and disc artwork, full-length episodes, and extras are a fitting presentation. Other than some picture and sound quality issues that are probably inherent in the source material, there's little room for improvement in this set. Unless somebody finds some "lost" negatives or higher-quality masters in a vault or basement somewhere and makes a high-def blu-ray transfer of them, this is probably the best presentation of the Bob Newhart Show we will ever get. Overall well worth the money and a set to be re-watched for many years to come. The concept and execution of "the sitcom" just doesn't get any better than the Bob Newhart Show, specifically as it is delivered in this DVD set. Enjoy!

The science is sound and the story is well written and with the exception of a few minor bumps quite believable.  Spoiler alert! The notion that a bunch of astronauts would embark on a trip to the outer planets dressed in business suits is a bit odd but other wise the attempts to beat the system are both believable and well portrayed.  Well worth watching.
I was honestly moved by this film -- even though I was born about a  decade later than the generation depicted in it.  Having had a mohawk is  not a pre-requisite to seeing this movie.  I recommend it without  reservation to anyone who won't get hung up on the fact that Stevo and  Heroin Bob don't look like everyone else.  In fact, I would say that those  who would get hung up on the way the characters look should watch this.  It  might just open their minds.
A year after the first incident, Julie (Hewitt) and company have won a trip to a tropical resort.

Check this movie out, the only thing missing is Arnold.
There are so many laughs, and so much sensitivity, that I'm not surprised at all that "Roxanne" is my sister's favorite Steve Martin movie. I love "L.A. Story", but have to give a slight edge to "Roxanne".
I am 27 years old and have had cancer twice. Had my husband been able to discover at the beginning of dating me that one year into our relationship I would be having surgery and radiation therapy due to the cancer I wonder if he still would have considered me a candidate for a mate.

483	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her "please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear." The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the "prostitute" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.
The movie plays a bit like an inside joke, though it is a joke that welcomes you in.  If you let yourself into the circle you'll find yourself rewarded with a terrific viewing experience.
