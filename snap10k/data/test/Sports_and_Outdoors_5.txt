When they ask why I have to carry such a big knife I reply "Because I never want to be caught with a knife to small to handle the job." I would call this a medium sized folder - there are many larger ones out there. It's easy to clip inside the pocket, and the stout handle doesn't make itself felt. When I got the knife, I lived in a different state where the blade length law on concealed knives allowed for 4" blades. Since this is 3.9", it was perfect.

I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend.

Goal was very easy to assemble.
Also if you cook bacon, or other high fat food, it splatters. Since the lip is low, it doesn't catch the grease spatters the way a good fry pan does. More stove cleanup...While it grills ok on the stove top, It's not a replacement for the charcoal cooker. You will need a good vent hood to catch the smoke. (Well yeah)
One word of caution - even the toughest band wouldn't be enough for an extremely strong person, so if you bench 400 and do 150 lbs on tricep pull-downs, you may have outgrown some of this equipment or will be bored with it.  However, even for the biggest person, there are some neat balance exercises and small muscle groups you could work on.
Bottom line is this would he a 2 star review if it weren't for the fact I only paid $31!!! This rod will get used probably half a dozen times a year. For the price and the little use it will see, I can live with the flaws.

Although heavy, ironically this is also apparently prone to leaks, even when it is cared for quite well.  On the second or third using, ours developed a slow leak, which resulted in the user unhappily awakened at 2:30am and again at 7:00am because she was lying flat on the cold ground, forcing her to re-inflate it with half a dozen deep breaths.  No one needs that, not at 2:30 am.
HOWEVER: There are many times that the watch has sat in my desk drawer waiting for parts while my G-Shock and Timex IronMan carry the load.  Today is one of those times. The Observer's wrist strap breaks every 18-24 months - and that occurs even with preventative maintenance on the band on a weekly basis. The replacement straps cost $40. My straps have broken for the 4th time. So, if you think that a $20/year cost of ownership on top of the price of the watch is a good bargain, then get this watch. If not, then get something that is a one-time investment only and doesn't require a hotline to the Suunto replacement parts store.

The handle is great, as you can lower or raise it so it works great no matter how tall/short your child is. It's also nice that the handle bar folds down to the part where you ride it, so it's easy to store away in your garage, shed, car (if traveling and bringing it with you), etc.  We will never own another scooter unless it has the Razor name on it again!!

Now to the children.  Nothing ruins an adult session of Aerobie more than kids.  Love them...have three myself...but until they're 10 or 11...let them play with a frisbee until they gain some ability to throw it.  All this talk about how easy it is for kids to throw is bull.  This thing will go a long way...and if your idea of a good time is chasing 60 yard wayward throws to nowhere...knock yourself out.  Mine is not.  It follows the exact angle of release...as stated...and until kids get it...playing with them is not fun.  It's like playing horse with a 6 year old...its cute at first...but quickly grows annoying and kills any spirit the session had...because they want to throw it...every time it comes near them.  "Whose turn is it to chase the disc?  It's over there by that house.  No...that one...way over there.  Have fun....I'm getting a hamburger."

Quality and utility both met my expectations.
My 37 lb son had a lot of fun jumping right away, although he did not jump as high as one thinks of with a trampoline. But for a small, indoor trampoline, I don't think you want your children flying too high. I also think that as his weight and ability increase, he will get more bounce out of it.

I consider a $90-$110 range to be "mid-grade" blades and this fits that category.  I like the Arc Lock that is similar to the Benchmade Axis, making it easy to wing this knife open (and closed) instantly with one hand, flick of the wrist.
The alignment of the magnet on the wheel is the key. The first time I had it too close and it used to hit the other "receiver" on the bike. I moved it a bit and it seems to be ok after that. I have used it for more than a month and it does what its supposed to do and reports all the statistics as mentioned in its manuals. I am not very sure how accurate they are, but it seems to be fairly accurate and tht is good enough for me.

2314	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I've owned the PowerAssist (S66N) for about a year and I've been very happy with it. I love the user-replaceable blades and while you may not like the 'wings', they're a lot nicer on your hands than the bare channel. Since I generally carry a small pocketknife, I don't really need a multi-tool with a knife.. So, I purchased the S60, planning on replacing the knife blade with another tool. HOWEVER, the S60N which I received, from Amazon, which appears to be the current shipping model, is the one with the single lock for the tools. The single lock sucks. No, really, it SUCKS. The S66N has the piano style locks where each tool has an individual lock. The problem with the single lock is that if all the tools, other than the one you're using, are not folded exactly right, the lock won't actually lock! This is a major problem!

512	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Have used 4-5 times in workouts and what I like most are the number of bands, and the fact that there are some easy baby level bands in there for wimps like me.  Those exercises I tried and failed at because the bands were stronger than an ox and my noodle arms are not ox like at all...well, the little yellow and blue guys in this pack are FANTASTIC.  I can work out with the big boys now.  Not five stars since don't know how hold up over long time, but that's a minor thing, and shouldn't deter you from dropping the very minimal amount of $ they charge for these.  Like the carabeeners since it makes combining the bands easy.  I even used handles from another set - just clipped them on and done.  Don't over think this - it's got a billion and one positive ratings, and if you are starting out like me, this has enough resistance to get you kicked off.
8980	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Not bad for what they are, but it's kind of annoying because they're super long and you have to roll the waist band, which would be fine, but then every time you go to the bathroom you sort of have to re-roll them. I prefer the other shorts Soffe makes, the mesh ones. I have three pairs of them and they're great for wearing around the house, they're more comfortable, they fit better, and they aren't a pain in the ass.

The total system is small, lightweight, and incredibly versatile.

6767	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad, so I wasn't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard.  I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one.  It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order, but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks.  They are quality, well-constructed and Made in the USA.  They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game.  The paint has chipped some but that hasn't bothered me since it doesn't interfere in playing the game.  I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games.
4276	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is the best minitool. It has two knife blades, so you can use one frequently, and keep the other super sharp for when you need super sharp. The scissors are easy to work, and are strong enough to cut small wire. They do get dull. The fingernail cleaner is just the right shape, and the file on it is useful for smoothing metal as well. The cuticle-pusher makes a decent multipurpose lever. The flat screwdriver is too small and thick and rounded and needs to have a lock. The inch-metric scale is useless. The pen is a lifesaver, but can be hard to get out. The tweezers often aren't strong enough to pull out a splinter, but they sometimes are. The cap lifter works, though it takes two or three bites and wrecks the cap. The phillips screwdriver is a marvel, driving anything from drywall to eyeglasses screws, but it should have a lock. The wire stripper notch in it sometimes works. The orange peeler is great for peeling oranges or cutting yourself if you open it by mistake.

One thing I was disappointed with were the turrets. It has hunter style turrets. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, my Monarch has spoiled me with target turrets. On a scope like this, however, I will probably zero it and not mess with the turrets much from there (99% of my shots will be within 200 yards and mostly within 100). That said, the turret adjustments are extremely crisp with a nice audible click.
To be honest, I got this because of the retractable pen which I wanted for "emergencies" such as writing down a phone number while on a walk or trek. However, although years ago I never would have thought of using the toothpick, I really miss it and it was replaced by the pen. Hey, I'm older. Food gets stuck, and the toothpick is there. Can't get it out with the pen. I wish they had left out the cuticle pusher. Pushing cuticles can wait till I get home. In fact, I don't remember ever pushing a cuticle...

- Durability. Im pretty sure that Coleman uses a thicker gage steel in their stove than the Camp Chef, which felt kind of flimsy. The Coleman uses pop-rivets in a couple places, but their rivets are fewer and of higher quality than the Camp Chef.

3777	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I had a dart board like this for years in the family room, but lost it in a move. The material that the Viper Shot King is made from will last forever. It is a well made board and the darts are good. They are not the premium quality and expensive darts used by many who are in leagues, but they are still very good. The darts go into the board easily and do not pop out from hitting the wires. This is always possible to happen, but seldom does.

As for the delay time after the cut out, who cares?  I don't take a shot and then carry on an important conversation immediately.  There is a few seconds delay but I mean come on, for general usage, is that really a problem?  It does not bother me in the least bit.

957	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I found myself spending too much time in the gym and was looking into a home workout system -- something that's thrifty with floor space.  We looked into various systems and decided on resistance bands.  We choose Black Mountain because of the positive feedbacks, and they did not disappoint. Besides, Reistance Band has a natural synergy with our wrought-iron staircase!  I bought a pair of adjustable dogs' collars (cheap and flexible system!) and is able to loop them through the intricate iron works to the height and lateral space desired.  I noted the resistant poundage on the band itself with a label maker; bought myself a set of ankle straps (the one that came with the set only has one ankle strap and it does not have lining; I need two to do leg-raises), and I am set to go to work.  The quality of the bands is good.  The right weight can be arrived at by combining different bands.  Changing the bands with the handle is easy.  After exercising, put everything back into the bag provided for storage, and no one even know that I have a home 'gym'.  I still go to the gym, and I rave about the product to my friends.
7694	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Bought this item for use in our home improvement projects, painting, sanding and even taking out 60's vinyl which could have been possibly-- made of asbestos material.  It worked well, certainly kept dirt and smells away.  We used it to sand down drywall from our bathroom & after 2 days of sanding the filter was noticeably dirty and nearly clogged.  My husband ran his filters under running water and it seemed to help keep it clean in between uses.  I kept mine original- no cleaning other than wiping the outside of the mask.  I used it for the other projects for a few weeks and it seemed to work well despite the weeks of use.  The mask itself worked well, keeping dirt, smells and toxic stuff out but I would say that it is extremely uncomfortable.  The plastic, while it securely hugs your face is not the softest.  Also, it is heavy.  I can only keep it on for 30mins max and I have to take it off to give myself a rest.

It doesn't hurt that they actually look halfway cool too with the orange/black/chrome.  Seems like they'll last a while as size is a little large for him now (age 6) with room to grow because of adjustable velcro closure.  Reasonably priced and best of all, they appear to give him greater confidence.

5147	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My boys are 6yrs and 8yrs and both love jumping on this pogo stick. I just didn't realize it had a 60# wt limit and my oldest is right at that weight. So far it has held up, we have had it for just over a month. I love the grow-to-pro base on it, it gave them the needed confidence to start jumping and now we can take it off and work on their balance. It is a little pricey, but my youngest ordered it with an Amazon gift card he received for his birthday, so it made it an easier purchase.
Now these can't be this good without a few minor limitations.  You do need to be creative with positioning the bands or your body to perform some exercises - you'll find them too long for some, too short for others.  I'm 6'3" and my wife is 5'7" - we both have to make some accommodations, but there is nothing we just cannot do.  Also, the addition or option of a bar would be awesome - hint, hint BMP!
Overall a good ball to start with.

7439	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great price, my daughter loves it. Rides it every day. Very sturdy.
6181	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The elliptical I received was not the one in the picture. The screen was completely different. The setup was pretty easy. When I started to use it, the speed and distance stayed at zero even though I was on it for a good few minutes. I tried to find some answers in the owner's manual, but all I found was a few workouts and nutritional facts. I emailed the company, and I am now waiting for a response. Besides the screen not working properly, it's a pretty good machine. It's not like the ones at the gym at all, but that's why you pay so little for it.

9998	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These grips help me with control. I can maintain a firm grip without a glove which gives me better control and feel. Highly recommended!
8987	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Fit exactly as expected. I am 5'5 1/2 and 150lbs and the Large work perfectly for me. If I were about 10lbs lighter I would order a size Medium because in time these do stretch.

I'm pretty sure I'll buy one of these in the near future, so that I can have some fluids with me when I'm out in hot weather and need to wet my whistle.
1014	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this mainly for use when I travel but I also works great when you can't get to the gym.  Amazingly compact as I can easily fit it on my carry-on bag and go anywhere.  It's pretty cool that you can keep all the bands in the door loop and can quickly connect/disconnect the ones you need to do the exercise.  I also like the varied work-out from using weights.  One thing nice is that the resistance increases the further you pull the band, which helps when you are working through an injury as a lot of stress occurs at the beginning of the movement (bad with weights).  Even if you are pretty strong you can get a good workout using a combination of the bands but I will probably get one of the higher weight bands.

Someone was shooting a 50bmg and my ears were protected. I wear hearing aids under the ear muffs and the protection was still excellent. The muff does push up somewhat when using a rifle, but not enough to move away from the ear. The attenuation is perfect, hardly noticing the drop in volume.
3190	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	outstanding for the price. i like the non slip on the top. this is great for the price. yeah you have to blow 40 or so times, its great exercise for your lungs, it is also bulkier and weigh more than the advance stuff, but it is very tough and grow some legs if you think it's heavy. i use it at home to lay around on, in the field camping on a tent and also use it with AMOK hammock. just the price alone and toughness. 5 stars easy

We left it outside overnight, and by the next morning one side had a rust stain on the blue cover.  I don't know how that happened, but oh well.  My daughter likes it, and does use it frequently.  It is a bit small, so you must put it somewhere with at least 3 feet perimeter for safety.  I still recommend it despite the horrible smell.

6447	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The Simple Review - Fun for the whole family
ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The thing I like best about these is the clip system -- bands are easy to add/subtract.  I hate the type you have to pull the bad through with much effort.  These just clip on easily and you can use multiple bands at a time with handles.  Very versatile, and lightweight.
6061	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These gadgets are great motivational devices and deserve most of the credit for my taking several long walks each week.  I started with the fairly pricey Digi-Walker but soon broke the non-spring clip and ended up ordering  two more at premium prices. Then I discovered Omrons and Boston Scientifics, but they struck me as overly touchy, not particularly accurate, and overloaded with bells and whistles.  The goal is to reach 10,000 steps--not to time yourself, count your calories, take your pulse, and keep monthly medical records.  The more complicated you make the device, the less likely you are to use it.  Observing that I was using and breaking pedometers, my family started giving me deluxe models from Sharper Image and Brookstone for Christmas and birthdays--some had built-in radios and others played canned, silly melodies to match my stride.  After a single walk, I was usually tired of them.
The Board is holding up well and I can say we have abused the hell out of it (we get drunk and throw the darts around really rough at the board), the bristles are staying very compacted, the dull darts have "hooked" some strands out, but nothing too serious... and again for 20$ its no big deal.

3953	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The wheels didn't spin. When I took them to customer service at a skating rink, he loosened the wheels but then they were wobbling. He told me these are cheap skates, wheels and the boot itself. They are not safe if you're planning on using them at a roller rink.
9260	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	simple mono line that does the job- I've used all kinds of fishing line, mono, braid, $2 line and $50 line.  This is always the one I come back to.  Keep it simple and catch fish.  Casts great, low memory, good feel.  Reeled in a 37" carp on 10# line.

Sometimes at the end of the day when I want to see how many miles I walked it shows zero.  I don't know if it got accidentally reset or if it never started recording at the beginning of the day.  I don't have this problem figured out yet.  When it records my miles walked (which is almost all the time) it does a good job.  This is the only feature I use on the pedometer and I can't comment on any of the other features.

3130	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for one single person,  personally it feels to me like a single airbed because the material is the same as an airbed.  I purchased the foot pump as it doesn't self inflat ,but for $8.00 I wouldn't expect it would.  It was comfy and I slept great on it ,with no back pain when I awoke ,& I have alot of back pain so that speaks volumes for the product! I would recommend this to anyone did I mention that it also has a pillow attached that inflatable as well. The only thing I would recommend is a carry case for it as it doesn't come with one thus 4 stars. Planning on getting another!

Great size for a 3 year old. It is soft, but has a hard innercore that could do some harm. It feels like a hard cardboard on the inside with a small amout of stuffing and then a soft exterior shell. The ball is soft and perfect for kids to play in the house.

4814	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This Coleman stove has two 10,000 BTU burners that have independently adjustable flames that let you simultaneously boil water (on HIGH) or simmer (on LOW) whatever it is you desire. You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions. This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results. It is a small unit, but it is very versatile and well-crafted. This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature. Matches or such are needed to ignite the propane fueled flame. The bottom line on this unit is that it can really throw out heat and it is easily regulated.

3664	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was born in the 80's, and this was brought into class a few times. This is very good stuff, and is exactly how I remember it. It is however expensive. I ate the 10 pack within a day or two. I bought this to try out for long term food storage. They will last only a few years, which is expected because it's a dairy product.
As for a workout, if you are thinking about using bands, they are effective and all your truly need to get toned.  I use them in the gymn setting and the workouts go by fast, can easily be increased to make sure you are reaching muscle failure and are flexible for all major muscle groups. I'm a workout novice, but love using them and I've had striking results in just months.

5188	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The main feature of this ball is a tacky surface that makes the ball easier to grip.  This feature works really well.  This ball has a noticeably better grip than the Wilson indoor/outdoor ball that I have been using for casual driveway basketball.  Otherwise, it is a typical indoor/outdoor ball.  It is well made and keeps inflated.  One interesting fact about this tacky ball is that when wet it becomes much slicker than a standard ball, which grips about the same when playing on a wet driveway.

Now for those unfamiliar with squirrel calls, they do not attract squirrels, but instead encourage squirrels to show themselves by moving from their hiding places.  I may have not had squirrels around me to alert or I may just need more practice!
Smell:  I didn't see any other reviews mention it but my unit had a strong plastic odor.  If you plan to keep this in a central living area or a bedroom you may have to have it air out because after weeks into owning it, the smell finally dissipated enough to keep it inside.

5537	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Perfect size for our 10 year old daughter. This is a classic black and white high visibility Ball. This ball has a shiny exterior which should help keep it from getting waterlogged during wet play, as well as to repel dirt. To clean you can just wipe with a damp cloth. The only thing I found slightly disappointing was that there were a couple of seams that were a little crooked. Not quite the quality I was expecting from Franklin ball labeled "competition" but, still a decent ball.
I returned both.

1264	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I am extremely disappointed in this gun cleaning kit. The first time I used it the plastic cloth holders broke off inside the gun rods. Absolutely the worst gun cleaning kit I have ever seen. What a waste of money. I will never buy an Outers product again. I bought an Otis kit after using this and very happy with the Otis kit.
2732	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We love these little boats.  We bought 4 of them.  They are really only 1 person boats for 7, 9, 12, 15 yr old kids.  We used them all summer long at a nearby pond and only 1 got a small air leak.  We made the handles like kayak oars.  We think they work better that way. We would definitely recommend these!  Great price and hours of entertainment.

1831	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are a great buy - very weighted down so they don't slide too easily but light enough for kids to easily transport themselves.  These are our favorite bases, I highly recommend them.

3307	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use these mattresses for my work with patients. This product replaces a much more expensive and poorer quality mattress. it is being used daily with hundred of people in various shapes and sizes lying on it. I find it durable, comfortable and cheaper option!
2873	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great replacement for our original Razor A scooter.  Now it moves just like it did when we bought it.  Easy to swap out with the old wheels.
Update 4-5-14: We just included the Fox 40 Micro in this test, up against the top 3 (Storm, Fox Sonic Blast, & Fox 40 Classic). It was no comparison. The Micro could barely be heard by either of us. I would put it at the bottom of the list, no better than a cheap $2 whistle. Although good quality, I wouldn't waste my money on this whistle, the way I did.
***  2014 update: I paid around eleven bucks for this item. At that price, it's a good value.  But I've also noticed that the price can almost double at times. If this pad is more pricey than usual, take a look at the budget Thermarest or Alps Mountaineering self-inflating pads.  If the prices are similar, it's a no brainer to splurge for the self-inflating pad.
8732	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have this in front of my bed. I need this to step on before I step on the hard floor  after getting out of bed. I don't recommend this for everyone. If you have good balance, but a bad back, knees or painful feet, stepping on this before the floor when getting out of bed before gravity brings everything down to your feet will mean a world of difference to that first and second step towards the bathroom. I'm getting the longer version next.
8228	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good compass. I have used it a couple of times now while out on overnight hikes and it's hasn't let me down yet.
2685	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My kids played with these inflatable boats in our pool over the summer and had a wonderful time. I would buy again. We didn't take very good care of it so one of them deflated. For the cost I would recommend friend and family to buy too.
6080	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought this stove several years ago in case of power outage. My home is total electric
The wheels are a hard plastic that get held up on small pebbles or cracks. This transmits a lot of the bumps to the user as well. My kids fell off several times due to the wheels hitting small things that other scooters with softer larger wheels would laugh at. They use it less and less and generally ride their bikes now.
2206	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Lets face it , for 28 and change I should have known better. Milk jug caps have better fit than the lens caps that come with these , the optics themselves yeah you can see with them a little but don't expect to see the allied landing on Normandy unless its 50 feet from you. I would hesitate to buy anything from bushnell around this price range until your up in the $200+ price range and its still probably NOT made in the USA. These will be going back and I will pick up a pair in a store , in person , good luck and happy hunting.

9696	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	everyone who has a boat with trolling motor needs one of these. You can operate it with your foot and still fish. When you need control of the trolling motor while chasing the birds it's great.

9678	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a great inexpensive way to get your life jackets on your boat and up and out of the way. The straps are durable and mine had no problems with the zippers as mentioned in other reviews. It is not the highest quality in the world, but I am replacing the exact same model which lasted many years so I can't complain. 4 stars only because it isn't top quality.
When I started P90X I used just one braided Reebok resistance band, because I didn't think I'd need multiple different resistance strengths. I was wrong. Certain exercises were too light, no matter how big I made the loop, and certain exercises too heavy, even with no loop. The problem, especially with making a really big loop, is that you overstretch the band and before you know it, it tears. Mine tore within 2 months.

When I'm sea kayaking I prefer to use a handheld compass on my spray skirt instead of a deck compass. I can enter a 'setting' direction and then just keep the needle aligned. This is less expensive than a deck compass, more accurate,  but harder to read degrees at a glance; still I find it better overall (deck compasses always seem to be working 'backward' to me.)
These are perfect in size, easy to set up and durable.  I just need one that fits on my couch now and I'll be all set.  Well, two of them because the boys won't let their sister in.  I mean three.  Three tents that will fit on my couch and we'll be all set.

2923	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My son's old Razor wheels were practically square - definitely time to replace.  My son is thrilled with the new wheels and a couple months later they are still working great.  Replacement was a little tricky - I normally can do those things myself, but had to enlist my husband's help.  It was also somewhat annoying that you needed 2 hex wrenches of the same size - we only have one set so had to find someone else to lend one.
6921	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and she was so excited. With the weight limit, she'll be able to enjoy it for years and pass it down to her brothers.  High quality and a brand I trust.

7055	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Purchased as a Christmas gift to replace our daughter's smaller scooter. As is typical with Razor it is a high quality, well built and easy to assemble product!  She was riding it within minutes. Fit her (7 yr old) well and should for the next few years.  I did purchase another set of wheels which light up from a different vendor to go along with this as well!
8099	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	These are not easy to use. It takes just the right technique which I never mastered so it didn't work. I honestly thought it was an easy boomerang that you just threw and it always came back to you! It was supposed to be for a 6 yr. old but after realizing it was so difficult, I put it away!
8778	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use this for balance training in my personal training studio.  High quality keeps it in perfect condition use after use.
197	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I've used Black Mountain resistance bands before and I like them. The company is also great -- previously, I had an issue with the foam handles on a band arriving damaged, and they replaced it cheerfully and quickly. This band came in good condition, no issues. The only thing I would mention is that you have to have a door in your house that has some clearance on either side, so you can insert the door anchor and have room to do the exercises. I have sixteen doors in my house and only one works for this purpose. It's in my office, so at least I'm reminded to get up every once in a while and exercise! I do find that the band is too short to do some exercises. Or maybe I just can't pull hard enough on it!
8268	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Have been using this for a few months now, take it everywhere. Rides in the bed of a truck. No signs of damage, no changes in utility. Perfectly fits a full frame camera and multiple lenses, charger, as well as a few other small items. Can't go wrong with pelican.
A suggestion for the company Black Mountain would be to make a longer booklet of exercises you can do with these bands or a DVD.
Cons - kind of big, case is cheap nylon, flimsy strap, lens covers don't fit well
3350	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My kid loves these. I guess the polarized lenses make it much easier for him to deal with the sunlight reflections in the pool. They are easy to adjust and don't let water in without having to tighten them too much.

9595	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good fish lure.
163	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this about a week ago and when I first received it I was exactly what I wanted. It provided the necessary resistance. However, after a few days of using it (I think I used it like 3-4 times), there was hardly any resistance. I wish I could get my money back.
1299	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Amazon product information states "Origin: USA", but the package is clearly labeled "Made in China."  I would not have purchased if it was accurately described, and I always ask if the origin isn't shown in the Amazon information.
Why not spend $8 more for the superb Omron HJ-112? The HJ-112 has dual pendulums inside so it counts accurately whether on your belt or in your pocket. And it's built like a tank.

I would highly recommend them and they take a total of 4 AAA batteries two in each piece and you can control the volume individually.  I would buy them again. They will not leave you a ringing sound such as wearing nothing at all.
6721	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I picked up one of these knives as a work knife for my hunting lease.  I used it all this past season and was impressed.  Very sharp, and so light it almost feels like a toy.  It cut burlap, canvas, camo netting, 550 cord and other assorted rope effortlessly.  It wouldn't be appropriate for chopping (too light), but it's definitely a cutter.  It would be great as a tackle box knife and I'm sure it would be satisfactory for self defense if necessary.  A few minor criticisms: the serrated edge portion of the blade is so small its essentially worthless.  I'm not a fan of serrated edges on knives to begin with; if I had it to do over again I'd buy the plain blade.  My other criticism is that the sheath feels flimsy, I would much prefer kydex or even leather.  This would be an ideal fixed blade knife for kids or adults with smaller hands.  I'm becoming more of a SOG fan than I ever expected to be. I prefer a heavier knife and bought a SOG Super Bowie 2.0 (fabulous blade!).  All in all, a great knife for the price.  I would recommend it.
5277	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are my all time favorite goggles. Have been swimming with speedo since I was little and I love the clear goggles I don't feel so confined when I swim. These are also the most comfortable goggles I have ever owned.
1125	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I had to stop going to the gym because of my back.  These resistance bands provide a very low impact work out, along with a good starting program with the included booklet.  My son even uses the lowest resistance band when he works out with me.

2029	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Speed focus bar is awesome.  It beats the typical twist focus ring.  The binoculars allow an ample amount of light generating a very clear image.  In fact the image seen through these binoculars is quite bright with fine details and accurate color rendition.  It's physically light weight enough but sturdy.  It feels very solid in your hands.  Although it does not have electronic image stabilizers, anchoring your elbows to your chest or a fence does the trick keeping the image steady.  I'm not familiar with the technology behind a good set of binoculars but I can certainly say, this Falcon 7x35 works great for our track meets, allowing me to see at least 100 yards ever so clearly.
Plenty of tips, almost as useful for DEflating as inflating, and it fills them MUCH faster than our old plug-in unit. It's quite a bit bigger than the plug-in it replaces, but being able to take it into the tent more than makes up for that.  Chinese Coleman isn't always as good as US Coleman used to be, but this little guy is everything I would expect and more.
5227	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	These broke on first use. The silicone tore completely through on the side where the elastic attaches. I'm very frustrated that Speedo has such bad customer service and will not stand by their products.

8786	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	You wouldn't think this Airex Balance Pad is anything special, but you know I've have been using mine for a couple of weeks and I could feel the "burn" the very first time. Ankles, knees & hips - it's a workout - turns out my trainer uses one also. Like anything you have to use it! It won't get better just by purchasing one.
Range testing proved that it was the best $69.00 I ever spent. You can actually hear better with these on! It keeps harmful noise out but allows conversation through. It blocked sounds from a 12 Gauge shotgun and from my 2-stroke weed wacker.

4081	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are pretty solid. I would only recommend them to somebody who keeps their firearms in a locking cabinet or hard case of some sorts, however. They do cover the trigger guards but on most applications, they can be moved around (and used to pull the trigger) if pushed hard enough. They are only meant to keep the trigger inaccessible, not to disable the firearm. If you have kids, or think theft a high possibility, get a locking cabinet and/or some cable locks that pass through the action. Otherwise, these serve their purpose well.
5021	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this mainly because I have hard pergo flooring and I wanted to do some sit-ups, leg lifts, and neck exercises on the floor.  This product is exactly what I needed.  I also like the design with the single fold (as opposed to double fold models sold here on Amazon) because it helps keep the inside layers clean when storing it away (the side I'm actually laying down on when I use it).  Handles are a nice touch.

Target sells a similar ring made by whammo, but it is made with a cheap plastic ring that seems to break easily. The Aerobie rings use a metal kind of ring with a rubber compound surrounding it so that it doesn't hurt when you catch it, but it also doesn't break. Our ring has hit a few tree trunks, been caught in the upper branches of trees, slammed into a rock wall, and still flies perfectly.
Overall, I think this compass is very good.  It had potential to be awesome, but comes up just a tad short.

These are a classic roller rink skate and are well made. I love the vintage old school look, and my daughter just lit up when we took them out of the box. Keep in mind when ordering that these run really big - at least a full size larger. My daughter normally wears a 3/4 in girls shoes so we ordered the 4, but these def are a full size larger. This will be ok as she can grow into them, but for now she puts on two pairs of cushy socks to fill the gap. I wear a womens size 6, and these were too big even for me. Another reviewer said these run true to size, so maybe it just depends. My daughter says these are comfortable, and she loves having her own skates when we go to the rink. These seem to be holding up well, and are definitely a good buy, especially with free shipping.

I liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted.  As soon as I switched to some "dial weights" I felt I was getting a better workout.  The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all.  In theory, if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating, I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.

I've also put a small grill top (from an older Coleman round grill) on a burner and roasted chili peppers with great success.  I've cooked everything from French toast and pancakes to steak on the stove, with equal success, despite the difficulty in turning the burners down very low.  With all of the cooking I've done, my sole complaint about the stove relates to after having had something boil over on the stove.  It will put out a burner, and it is very difficult to get the burner to relight, even an hour after the boil over occurred and several attempts to dry off the gas burner itself.  Only with some effort from the magical lighter I have (it's like a tiny blow torch!) was I able to eventually relight the burner.

I probably would have given this knife a 5 star rating but the lock up while fast, and easy to operate, was not as solid as I would prefer and the knife I received has a very slight amount of vertical play.  Not enough to warrant returning, but enough to knock a star off when compared to a similar priced Benchmade Griptilian or Gerber Downrange.  In fairness, this knife retails for about $20-$30 less than the aforementioned folders and I think can hold its own against similar knives.  I do prefer the heft and palm feel of the Gerber Applegate Fairbairn Covert and Combat Folders over this SOG, however they are not quite as fast.  If you like a folder that feels like a a fixed blade, get the Gerber (not the mini-Covert). If you like a lighter dagger profile, you will love this knife.

The SPRI website has this to say about the blue bands, which I would agree with: "Blue Xertube is for very fit women or fit men. At 1-1/2 times its length, the weight equivalence of this tube is approximately 15 pounds."  If you need less resistance, try the red (medium), green (light) or yellow (very light) bands.

the higher end of the 'o.s.s.' line of brunton compasses are still made in the usa as far as I know, at least the higher priced models, but I've read mixed reviews of these by some very experienced compass users, mostly negative...i'm all for supporting american made products but apparently, with the lower priced models, one can't be sure what one gets as far as quality and more often than not it will be sub par...at least in the most recent years, this might still change for the better....use your own research to determine if it's something you'd want...it IS still the only american made compass brand i believe at present...

4694	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	classic and does the job nicely.  Brings me back to my childhood.  The old design holds up well for camp cooking and puts out a ton of  heat.  The new integrated handle is very helpful in transporting the stove.  The stove is very compact and easy to get ready to cook.  It is well build and solid.  The valve controls are not that sensitive, so you may have hard time keeping stove lit with lower gas flow levels. (This is why I did not give it 5 stars)  I overcame this by using a slightly higher gas level and using my griddle to use for low heat. I am sure the higher priced stoves have more sensitive valves but I don't think it is worth the extra cost.  It is a hefty so this is for car camping. I love this grill and enjoy cooking on it.  Highly recommend for the price.

It does hold 5 gallons of water, it does have a spigot and the handle does support it's weight...at least for the short distances over which I've carried it. The spigot was so slow that I decided to leave it in the car when walk-in camping for mare convenient refills of a 1 gallon jug that I pack in the 1/2 mile to the camping site.

Buy your bones reds from Amazon.  They are about 3 times cheaper than online shops.  You will probably need spacers.  This is debatable, but I put them in anyway.

I think the downside to this mat is the valve.  It would be nice if it was bigger (like an air mattress). That way it would inflate/deflate much faster.  To deflate this mat, you have to pinch to valve to keep it open while also pushing the air out of the mat.  Not the easiest and it takes a while.

2542	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	i have an Intex Seahawk II. with this pump I can inflate the main chambers and floor twice as fast as with the standard supplied pump. as for deflating, the floor and seats have squeeze valves and the supplied adapter fits to deflate them, however I don't see any way to use the pump to deflate the main chambers, not that it is realy needed, when the Boston valves are fully opened air releases quickly. it would though be nice to draw the air out of the main chambers to get them flatter, it would be easier to fold up and put in the carry bag. there may be a way to deflate via the Boston valves, if there is I havnt figured it out yet. when using the pump hose as if to inflate, and changing sides on the bottom of the pump itself a great deal of pressure is needed and it doesnt feel right, the faster inlfation in my opinion makes the pump well worth the price.

2. for single foot balancing; the person expecting them to make squats more challenging was disappointed. I can see why. I would recommend two inflated balance discs for giving two-footed squats a balance challenge. Incidentally, Theraband also makes smaller single-foot balance pads in green (easier) and blue (softer and more challenging) that I was introduced to at a rehabilitation clinic. The Airex is bigger and harder to balance on -- probably not the best initial choice for a person who is trying to rehab a broken ankle or leg.

4605	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For safety, Coleman is superior. I've owned other brands, and I cook outside on my covered porch every day. Fish, cauliflower, seared high temp steak, etc. Stuff that would smell up the inside of our house. So I've had other brands malfunction, especially at low outside temps. I wouldn't recommend doing any technical repair work on the valves, like another reviewer accomplished. Needless to say, gas stoves can be dangerous . So don't fool around with valve repair. Flame adjusting from high to very low is best done by first, turning off the burner, then just barely turning it back on again and relighting it , of course. The only major change I'd strongly recommend ; probably or any lightweight camp stove ; is to attach it to another surface for stability. A heavy pot can cause the stove to move, if you move the pot around while cooking. For safety, I'd recommend permanently attaching it to a 3\4 " plywood, about 4" wider this all directions, by long sheetrock screws around the outside ( tightly close to the stove--not drilled through any metal)  My stove is attached in this way to an aluminum-covered , wooden table, and the table is also screwed to the porch floor. I also have a grill-tank, not the small cannisters, as the gas supply, and have done so for many years ; standard hardware is available to make the conversion.

9944	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It will and won't run braid. Been looking for a spincast that will and I assume with the leveling spool this would. Put 15 lb ez braid on it and it worked fine until I let it sit up overnight, then it wouldn't cast worth a flip. Pulled the line out, re-reeled, and it cast fine. Wash rinse repeat, it's not worth your time. So I tried 50 lb sufix 832 just out of curiosity and it wouldn't cast at all. Larger braid usually rules out the dig in problem smaller braid incurs. I believe it's the fast motion of the leveling mechanism that doesn't allow the braid to crisscross enough. Your best bet is 12 lb fluorocarbon and to not overfill the spool as once the spool is too full you've increased your line pull per inch and it gets significantly harder to reel. You'll notice when it's too much. Build quality is great and it casts a mile. Top heavy but I knew that going in. Get the smaller version and run the best 8 lb fluorocarbon you can, you won't be dissapointed.

439	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I suffer from degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis, among other back problems.  I've always worked out and kept in shape.  Since my back condition has worsened, my dr recommend that I stop lifting heavy weights and try using different exercise bands.  I've been using these BMP resistance bands for several weeks.  I absolutely love them.  They are very convenient to use, especially if you travel.  I can adjust the amount of weight or resistance by the color of the bands .  I use the bands to do a variety of exercises, in place of swinging my heavier iron.  Great for building strength by doing more reps with less weight.  I highly recommend this company, as well as, these bands.

4740	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My grandfather has had a coleman stove like this for as long as I can remember, so when I was planning a camping trip, I ordered one for myself. It's just like his, and I'm sure I'll be able to use this for a very long time. The only problem I have with it (and I don't recall having this problem with my grandfather's) is that it's really hard to get the flame to stay low enough. For whatever reason, the knobs to adjust it don't stay in place well, so even if you adjust the flame to very low, as soon as you let go of the knob it turns a bit and the flame gets higher. But I guess a camping stove can't work quite as well as a stove at home... Anyway it's still a very useful stove. I just have to adjust the heat carefully.

6576	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've had a number of these since I was a kid, and they are always a ton of fun to play with. Surprisingly durable too for something so slim and light. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys frisbee, just make sure you have a BIG field to play in, as it can quite easily clear a football field, particularly if their is a breeze.
From what I've seen with this rebounder, I think my concerns are really nothing to be thinking of.  This set assembled easily enough and seems that it will hold up well enough and work well enough for my grandson to enjoy using to practice his skills on the soccer field (or, in the case of this item, on our lawn, or his parents lawn if he takes it home for a while to use there).
107	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I'm not really any good at pull ups or chin ups, but this is a decent item for a beginner, if paired with a stool or chair. Most of the grips are comfortable, and the only "sturdiness" concerns I have are that my doorjamb is strong enough to hold me up. Only complaint is that the grip cushions on the upturned grip slide down when held, but it's not a deal breaker to me. Works great with P90X!
Pros: See above statement . Quick and easy to assemble . The colors are vivid . It's has proven to be durable with a rough 21 month old and survived movers placing a box on it, it popped right up again .
+ Comfortable; these are easily adjustable to fit most heads (note: I suspect those that complained about this didn't read the instructions)
The Foam Maverick is great for my youngest--who is unable to get any of the other pogos bouncing due to her size and weight (she is 9 years old, about 75 lbs).  The Foam Master was originally purchased for my now 13 year old, but it wasn't aggressive enough for her as she bottomed out on it right away.  We find that it works great for friends who are more hesitant bouncers and/or who aren't big/heavy enough to use the Super Pogo.

The down side to the burners is that they really don't turn down to a low simmer.  For those who like to simmer things with their camp stove, I would suggest buying a flame tamer to make it more feasible.  During summer trips, we typically don't simmer anything but we do simmer soups and chilies during fall, winter, and early spring trips.  For outdoor cooking at home, the flame tamer is also a great idea to keep your sanity while avoiding scorched dishes.  They are easy to use, and available from Amazon.
this is easy - folds and in a bucket near the door - at school - and in a home depot bucket in the garage.
1180	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Ive used only a few resistance bands on normally the ones that come with different games for XBOX and Wii.  Bought 1 or 2 others from Sporting goods stores.

3064	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I don't often give a poor review. Unfortunately, this product's biggest shortfall, the fill-valve, is the reason why. It (the fill-valve) is small, most difficult by which to fill and exhaust air, that the larger air mattress I used previously, proved far and away an easier product to use. This one will test the lung capacity of an Olympic cyclist, and if you're a smoker, or suffer from COPD or any other lung-related woes, this is not the mattress for you. And exhausting this turkey is just as frustrating, as the tiny valve demands constant massaging as you fold and exhaust, fold and exhaust.

557	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	So I don't usually write negative reviews, but I have to for this one. I bought these to replace a Tower cable system which I used for 5 years and finally snapped. These don't even come close to it. The bands and clips feel flimsy. The door anchor is fine, but it feels like if you pull too hard it'll pull the whole door off the hinges. My two issues are the fact that really cannot do any exercise below the waist since there is no way to anchor at the bottom of the door, unless your door is hung poorly and is flush to the floor. The bands are also way too long. I'd recommend try another product, this one just doesn't cut the mustard.

It does stay warmer in the tent if you close the door opening. What I like, is that you can situp in there and a toddler can stand on bed in the middle and still has room up top.

At this price, you cannot go wrong. I'd suggest getting two resistance levels, or even three, so that you can tier your workouts according to what you want your end result to be. You can control resistance with each band, but a since resistance will only take you so far.

4937	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've had this mat for 5 years, and thought I should put in my two cents.  It's a perfect exercise mat, much better than exercising on carpet and likely much better than those thin roll-up things.  We even took it to a party at a campground to be sure we'd have something comfortable to sit on.  I keep it propped against a wall in the hallway, and the handles make it convenient and easy to carry.  It's the perfect size and I am completely satisfied with this purchase.
Magnifier - I believe it is a 5x magnifier on the Suunto and the Silva, and a 6x on the K&R.  All three compass magnifiers easily ignited my char cloth in the noon-day sun.

6542	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I'd played with some version of this 10 or 15 years back, and it kinda su***d.  Whatever enhancements they've engineered in, the current model is RIDICULOUS!  After three or four throws to figure out what was going on, I started throwing it a football field's length, easily, I had to keep on trotting backwards so as to not overthrow.  Then with another 10 or 15 tries, I started being able to throw it pretty darn accurately, to someone standing in the opposite goal area (it was on a soccer field).  It's also a softer rubber now, doesn't hurt when you catch it.  Twenty years ago I played a lot of Frisbee, but my 9-year-old daughter and my girlfriend's 12-year-old son soon got the hang of it, and were throwing it 50, 60, 70 yards.  They had a bit of trouble with curving and accuracy.  But once you or your kid knows how to throw a Frisbee reasonably well, this Aerobie is a BLAST!
I've owned 5 balls prior to this and this is by far the best. Highly recommended!

I compared this one with our 21 year old model, it's the same good quality. The latch is the same as the old one. The gas tank holds in its slots just fine. The wind guards are strong, flexible, and lightweight. The burners are exactly the same as the ones on my old Coleman stove and work wonderfully. The only real difference I see between my old Coleman and this one is the pump of the new one uses some plastic parts, and might not be quite as sturdy. But the rest of the unit looks and works just fine.
A small 16.4 ounce propane tank lasts a really long time we found, although, with the right adapter you can use normal large propane tanks. Also, we like to put some non-slip tape on the bottom as it can get quite slippery during use. The fit and finish is medium quality, though, unlike the ones that used to be made in USA long ago.

912	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Use the setup on a closet door a couple times a week. I would like it if each band could be used with just one handle instead of both at the same time, but that is how they are designed and I could see that going in when purchased.

2623	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good quality and tough.  Actually, I did not use this for my garage door, but used it as a seal for my homemade truck cap.  I nailed it to my cap bottom as a water seal and to be gentle on my truck's paint job.
6886	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It's flexible plastic, holds water and collapses when not in use. Not much else can be said about it other than the nozzle doesn't flow as fast as I would like but it does okay.

7586	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I spent $29 with no tax & free shipping, at that price, it's excellent.  My 8, 5, and 3 year old all have the A Kick, and they use them frequently.  They enjoy them, I find them to be a very good quality scooter and  a very good value for the money.
631	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought 2 sets of these so I could simultaneously work my left and right sides equally.  The quality is great.  I gave them four out of five because I would gladly give up having 5 slightly different resistances for an option to have duplicates or to be able to choose the 'colors' I want.  This is a VERY good product it's just that for my needs, I had to pay twice.
3363	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Not exactly what I wanted, but OK for the price. I was hoping these Frisbees were smooth enough on top to slide on carpet, but they are not. They have concentric ridges going out from the center. I wanted to use 2 of them for exercise sliders. I am too cheap to pay what they're asking for 2 plastic discs packaged as exercise equipment. I also looked at the sliders marketed to move furniture, but they come in a set with small discs I don't need and the price is crazy. These seem OK for the price. They can be bent easily, so I don't know how durable they are. I'll pass them along to someone with young kids.

A good tool to use for all your home inflating needs and can get the kids involved in the process too.

This is a tool and a friend.

This is a little kids ball so I'm not holding it to a professional standard but it does seem to wear and a tear a bit more than I'd expected.

The 3rd time I used the item, I rode over a normal sidewalk bump and the computer bounced off the base into the bushes in the dark and disappeared ...looked for 10 minutes with flashlights and decided to write this off as "I received what I paid for."
Now I'm thinking of buying another one, so that next time my girl and I can build an igloo together.  Last time I was having too much fun building castle myself and my girl didn't use it much :)

Now the bad parts. Took them to an indoor range wearing them outside the shooting area sounded great, walked in and hear a BANG from a 9mm was like umm ok. Kept walking towards the lane and hear another .40cal go off had ringing in my ears. Right away I got out went grabbing regular nr25 slim protectors and it was a major difference. You must wear additional ear plugs using this at least for indoor range or anything powerful. Also no light for on and off light.

This is not a stove for long-term hard-core camping because of weight and space of the stove and propane tanks, but its definitely good for the average person who camps, or as a short term back up in case of a power outage or other disastrous event.

9927	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My son was pleased with this!
2983	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Wouldn't hold air after a few weeks of use
3131	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great deal for the price. You can fold these up relatively small and fit them in your pack. I'd say they conservatively lift you 1 1/2 inches off the ground. They do stay well inflated.
8397	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is an awesome scope! I put it on my 30-06 and love it!  I was in debate on the 3x9-40 or the 3x9-50, I went with the 3x9-50 and am glad I did.  I have only range shot this scope out to 300yds and was impressed with how clear it is.  It's not as clear as my VX-III I have on my Ruger 280 but at about 1/10 the price it is well worth it.  I've put about 20 shots through my rifle and never had to re-zero it. I feel more than comfortable taking an Elk with this scope 300-500 yds, if I can't call them closer that is.
9359	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I'm XL in everything else, but in these, the Large fits properly.
They are so heavy you can mess up your manicured lawn and I won't let my younger children toss them because they will break something or someone. Looked a long time for great horseshoes and I am very satisfied with these.
The stick is just perfect for Im in height. Not heavy but sturdy. Very safe, as its padded. And the ball is soft too, also padded. I let him play and run in the house. So much fun!!!
510	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Nice, nicest.
4876	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what i was looking for
 The black color is actually a piece of fabric that has been glued to the mat. It's only on the top side of the mat and I'm not exactly what purpose its supposed to serve. Maybe it keeps you from sliding off?

3057	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I see some good and bad reviews, maybe I got lucky. This is very basic, not going to be the same as the expensive mats, but I camped on this for 6 nights and it was just fine, my tent is clean and clear of items that could puncture it, the inflation lasted just fine, now I deflated and re-inflated every day. but it lasted just fine overnight. One suggestion, get a pump I almost passed out inflating this by mouth... lol
429	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product
A badly designed product.  Not recommended.  :o(
3381	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Throws great! Use it at the beach. Not good for dogs to catch though, very light weight.
907	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	For $30 this is a pretty comprehensive, well made set of bands and accessories to make them useful.  However, for my purposes I found the strongest band barely strong enough to get any benefit from exercising with it.  The other bands will never be used unless I find some alternative exercises that require less resistance.  This isn't a complaint about the product, it has more to do with an individual's needs.
2556	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	good price

***************************
--Other reviews give a hit or miss coverage of the DUAL opening latch on the strap.  It does have 2 openings, the second is to give additional access if you have large hands/small wrists.  One review stated, incorrectly, that the second latch undermines the first latches ability to hold it together tightly.  If they would have examined the second latch in more detail, they would see that the primary latch COVERS the second with a gate, preventing it from opening.  IN NO WAY does the second latch make this strap less strong.  Typical Suunto, well engineered, but poorly documented.

Obviously not the best in quality, meaning everlast, but for a kid and what is described for its perfect for it.
9324	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect. Very strong for 4# test line.
Very easy to set up and light. Actually consumed very little propane over 3 days. Puts out
8606	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love these bands because they all have their own individual handles. They are easy to take with you when traveling. I use these bands on a daily basis to work both legs and upper body. My husband always poo pooed them because he thought they were only for girls, until he saw another guy at the gym using them. He started to using them and even he was amazed at the workout they gave him.
2992	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I camped for the eclipse and arrived at my destination later than expected, so I had to basically throw a tent "somewhere" where I had space (in the dark). I didn't want to make a bunch of noise, either, so I used a foot bellows pump to inflate this thing. While it took several minutes, it was WAY less time than this method would have taken with a "typical" airbed.
Anyway, the knife itself is great, the blade action is really really smooth and the lock is easy to manipulate and strong. I would suggest removing the clip as soon as you get it.
Reamer/Sewing Eye.  The punch doesn't work as well as the ones on Alox knives like the Pioneer, but still works well. The sewing eye is way too large to actually sew something.
I have to remember to take it off of my keychain before I fly. In this light, there are also various events and locations that give me trouble for having a knife on my person. Some events, concerts, synagogues, etc. either make me leave it outside (meaning it usually gets lost or stolen unless I find a good hiding spot) or say "You better not bring this next time."
3887	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This dartboard has been amazing! It holds darts perfectly and has held up to months of constant playing with minimum wear. There is a decent bounce out rate though, but no more than any other dart board you would use. The colors are really nice. Don't hesitate to buy this one.

5069	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Very small for 12 yr old returned them check hand sizing first probably good for small child 5-8 yr old not good for a 12 yr old

8745	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Use this at physical therapy and bought it for home. Love it and worth the extra money - and I don't spend easily. Comes with a sheet of exercises that I like. Excellent for balance exercises.
Now that I think about it, the case probably comes with a bottle just to make sure people know what the case is for and don't start suing Tamrac because someone's expensive lens gets ruined carrying it around in a case made for a water bottle. :D
336	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Wife used for rehabbing shoulder injury. Saved time (and money) from having to do exercises at orthopedist's office. Seemed to be high quality.
What I don't like is the effort required to change batteries. You must first remove the delicate foam pads without tearing them, then swap the batteries and then reinstall the way too delicate foam pads - hopefully without tearing them. This is not a 60-second battery swap. There is no excuse for a design this poor. Battery doors are not a new idea.
3693	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Way better than the 4D options out there! I blew up 3 Queen size mattresses before it died.

4449	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good propane stove and we had no major issues during our camping trips. The only item that I would like Coleman to improve is the two knobs for adjusting the flame because these knobs are cheaply made.
8441	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	After being bore-sighted and zeroed, I was ready for my hunt. The night before opening day Elk season, I wanted to make sure my rifle was zeroed. Fired 1 round and the scope lost pressure and shattered internally. Let me say again - shattered. You may be wondering - Why are you hunting elk with .50BMG. Wrong again. I had this on my 30-06. Fired 10 rounds total. Could no longer hunt the opening weekend that I had planned to hunt all year because I was in a remote area far from replacement (I will not be fixing this as I will never make the mistake of going cheap on optics again).
112	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I started the P90X program by using resistance bands but after a bit, felt I needed to really go the true Pull Up route instead.  After looking around Amazon, it made the most sense for me to go with the BMP bar.  I had previously purchased the BMP resistance bands and I'm happy with those so far.  Well, the package arrive (yay Prime) and I quickly assembled it.  Make certain that you tighten the locking nuts really well.  I didn't use the optional but included black "L" brackets and placed it right on the door frame to see how it felt.  It feels very solid and is in no way going to hurt the door, moulding, or surrounding wall.  I'm using a fire door from my laundry room to my garage.  The nice thing is that my garage steps down 6-8 inches so as I place the bar facing the garage, I get that additional height to work with.  Goes up and comes down in < 10 seconds.
3787	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great quality and really nice finish.
3095	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We got this because we have family coming over and not enough beds. It was a blessing, even thought you need a pump to fill it up it wasn't too much work. We try a foot pump and it was doing nothing. I didn't slept on it but my kid didn't complained. We have used a couple of times now.
4040	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I love the movie Castaway and had to get this for my office.  Lots of comments from everyone who sees it. A must for the Castaway fan.
3193	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I am so dissapointed with these! You MUST get a pump or they do not blow up! We spent 20+ minutes trying to inflate one and were red in the face when we gave up. It was also very difficult to deflate too. The fabric is very thick and these are very heavy. I would never be able to take these on a long hike because of the weight. I thought I was getting something I could blow up with lung power relatively easy, this is not at all what I was thinking they would be.
3026	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Purchased this mattress last September for my wife. We used it once for a late season camp out. It seemed fine, and she said it was comfortable. Folded it back up after camping and stored it with the rest of the gear in the garage. Fast forward to this year. Went camping mid June and got all of the gear out of storage. everything was fine until we went to go to bed. This thing would not hold air. Attempted to air it up several times, but nope flat again in a few minutes. Turns out that where the mattress was folded the material had cracked where it had creased. Very Disappointing and a total waste. Glad we only wasted like 8 bucks on it. Made from cheap, garbage materials. I have other air mattresses that I have used for decades and they hold up fine under the same conditions this one failed under. Avoid this product, it is trash. Granted if you only want to use it once I guess its fine.

3293	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I have been so sick of failed air mattresses that deflate or get the mystery holes, and you spend a lot of money on them.  I decided to try these.  I bought three of them, one for myself and my two kids. This is much more comfortable to me as when I shared a mattress with my kids I would be the one squishing it down, as I weigh much more than them, and waking up with my hips on the ground; which really killed my back!  These mattresses can be a pain to air up and deflate, but with the use of a pump both of those processes are much easier.

7043	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Showed up on time and my daughter likes it.
I have used this rack on two 100 mile trips with no issues. The bikes were stable, and did not shift during transit. I did use additional ties to secure the wheels. I would highly recommend this rack.
Some people have said the elastic is more difficult to jump on, but our little guy seems to have no complaints.
Also, the fit and finish of the S66N (purchased November 2015) compared to the S60N (purchased November 2014) is like a child toy. The S66N has razor sharp ruler markings and a beautiful finish. All the individual tools are shiny without any casting imperfections. The S60N's ruler markings are so faded/indistinct that they're almost unusable. The phillips screwdriver is a rough casting with poorly defined screw blades. The marlinspike has jagged burrs on it - it will ruin the rope of any knot you try to use it on.
1827	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My kids and neighbor kids have really enjoyed this.  Seems pretty decent so far.  The top bar did bend when a kid grab a hold of it but it really isn't made well enough for that.  Overall I am pleased.  We don't have it anchored in the ground and they where kicking pretty hard goals 9-14 yr old boys and it wasn't moving.

5811	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	There is nothing spectacular about these pads, light, small, and the quality seems okay. I wouldn't expect them to last under heavy abuse, but for added protection for a young kid that's not shredding I think they are fine.
9654	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Not happy with this 6 lb line. It seems the line was old. It is brittle and breaks easily. Lost a fish on my second cast. Immediately stop using and off the solo it goes.

8005	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect ball for my daughter.  Great size and very durable.  Glow in the dark an added bonus.  She can't help but kick this ball in the street but it has held up well over the past year.  Very happy with this purchase.

537	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These work well and the variety is nice. Color coding helps to separate the different resistances, but these would really be helpful if the resistance was printed on the clip holder. Because of this I took one star since I have to write them on there myself and other similar products have this feature. I chose this over other options since it was multiple bands in one package and being able to clip on different attachments has been useful.
*** I had to revise my statement. This thing is a piece of junk. It is even too small even for some children's hands. There is no good use for this thing at all. It is a waste of steel.
Gerber makes a quality product and I highly recommend this knife!
It is pretty accurate, the sights are non-adjustable yet at distance mine seems to only need to compensated by aiming slightly higher *naturally* and to the right a bit as the bolts seem to go somewhat to the left.
1176	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	easy to pack up this equipment to travel.  it is also easy to store and easy to use at home. it takes up no large footprint in the house but it is easy to access and simple to use. the multiple "strengths" of the cords make it easy to get a decent workout.
3724	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this for camping last summer based on the reviews but when I got it the packaging was all busted up. But I plugged it in and it worked.  I was terribly disappointed with it as I only got to blow up one and a half beds when it stopped working properly.  All of a sudden it lost power and not matter how long I charged it for it just never regained full power. So I was very disappointed.

I purchased the Eclipse because of the reviews on Amazon - mostly they indicated that the machine worked great, but would break after two years of daily use.  This I can live with.  Heck, if an exercise machine isn't a rack for partially-dirty clothing at this point and I've put in 800 hours of sweat and blood into it, it's still far cheaper than joining an exercise club.

3951	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	So for my wife's birthday I bought her "Breath of fresh air" skates at the local rink, came with her choice of wheel color and for another $30 or so I added color matched laces, wheel nuts, truck cushions and toe stops.  My youngest never was interested in skating but now that Mom is going more often wants a set.  I figure these are OK since she doesn't even like skating that much.  Well now that I bought better bearings, new wheels in her color and toe stops to match, I could have spent an extra $20 and gotten her the same skates I bought her mom, and the boots and truck would have been light years better.  The moral, if you even might start upgrading these, just buy better ones to begin with.
5509	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent indoor outdoor soccer ball for our three year old and his 3-5 year old friends. This ball came slightly less than fully inflated but instead of pumping it further we have been using it this way because it's nice and soft-can even play with barefoot. It's a nice looking ball that has stayed out in the rain without issue. It wipes off easilynwih water but really doesn't get marks on it. Love franklin sports balls and this one is another great one. High quality. Highly recommend

A must have for most kids.
6997	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My 10 year old loves it.  It's been about 3 months and it has held up nicely.  His younger sister has one of the smaller, plastic models and we're constantly having to adjust the "alignment" so the front wheel doesn't face the side.  Not with this one :)

- lots of options- 5 bands, 2 handles, 1 wrapstrap, and one door attachment. It also come with some helpful instructions(some exercise ideas in it) and what looks like a great warranty. I won't be using the heavier bands for a while but my boyfriend likes them. Use it on the floor, standing, or with the door.
7360	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I recieved this item and it is a great little kick scooter just as it is pictured and advertised to be BUT, they made a serious design flaw in that in order to save space when shipping they made the handles on the upper most bar that are used to steer and hold onto have been altered so they can be attached/removed for folding purposes with NO ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY TO REMAIN IN PLACE. As a result of this my youngest daughter was kick scooting down the street and she was holding onto the handle bars for control and stability she inadvertantly thumbed the release buttons making the bars she was holding onto spin and them slip out and away from the "T" neck assembly giving her no control as well as any support to keep her from falling forward into the upright bar itself and ultimately falling face first onto the pavement knocking her front teeth out!! I was shocked, scared, and in a horrific nightmare as I watched without being able to do a thng as it all happened in the blink of an eye, but upon recounting the event over and over in my head and in my dreams(make that nightmares) keeping me awake OR waking me, it seemed like hours watching my beautiful baby girl come crashing to the pavement face first after busting her face on the "T" bar which holds the handles. There isn't even a safety device which can lock these into position only a very easily pushed button which leaves any child and parent completly helpless as they watch their child crash to the street!! I am having the scooter analyzed by an engineer and will be contacting Amazon directly to gain a recall on these dangerous scooters!!. My older daughter had the same scooter BUT the handle bars were solid at the top making it a solid "T" that could only be safely tightened into an upper or lower position and just like this one it also folded through the use of a latch. Razor made a serious design flaw making the handles so unwisely and unsafely useless by adding these buttons to them just to save six inches of boxing material or space for shipping/packaging and is just down right silly, unsafe and irreasponsible!! I will post pics as to the nature of my daughters scooter so all parents will be able to see the safety concern as well as my other daughters older version "the original one" that did not use this dangerous method to aid in the lower cost of boxing materials for packaging/shipping where the money saved is paid by yours/ours childrens faces and or safety!! I am extremely upset and will also be bringing this to the FTC as well as the H.R. 5818 (98th): Toy Safety Act of 1984 Introduced:
3808	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product!
The only issue I had with it is that behavior on how to reset the trip computers distance / avg time / max speed.  On my cateye, I press the two buttons to reset the current ride (dist to 0, avg time to 0, max speed to 0).  When I do this on the Schwinn bike computer, it reset the entire computer and I had to setup the computer again.  The way to do it is slightly different: you have to go into the trip computer screen and hold the left button for 2 sec and you reset the current trip.

1057	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It's been a few days since I've had these so I cannot speak for their durability. You can do just about anything with these bands. I use these bands to pre and post exhaust my body parts during a workout, but you can certainly use them as tools for the main bulk of your workout. I find the bands extremely helpful for arms (shoulders, biceps, triceps), abs (resistance decline situps), and chest (pushups), but you can probably find ways to incorporate every body part. I would recommend YouTube/Google to find creative ways in using these things. If you go beyond the listed exercises, you'll have a much better workout. The only limitations of these bands is your imagination. And that's one of the greatest aspects of these bands: versatility.

My weight bench is a standard Marcy bench that does not allow for the attachment of a leg developer.  Prior to purchasing this set, I could do single arm flyes from the high position in various formats.  This is an acceptable way to accomplish this exercise if and only if you maintain even counts, form, and weight to avoid lop sided development.  This is a lot harder than it sounds.

Surface material (not all vinyl)
8843	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a good product. The resistance is good, and it works if you put it on the top of a door.

So if you wanted to use this for horizontal abduction and adduction arm exercises, you probably won't be able to unless you have someone to hold it for you.

I'll apologize for this review, but if you can find this knife in a store, then look for one without the pen, with a toothpick, about an eighth of an inch thinner, and you have my 5 star favorite. And while you're at it, but a pocket knife sharpener. (It looks like a pen, but it's a baby sharpener life you'd use at Thanksgiving.) It's similar to the "Executive." Maybe it's a small Executive, but what kind of executive is peeling oranges in his or her office (the executive's "extra" blade that somebody in Switzerland must have thought was essential for army execs).
It is a solid board, well made, but VERY HEAVY so plan on having some good mounting tools.

8163	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent compass. Reads within 2 deg. of all my others, so certainly looks to be true. Definately like the mechanical declination adjustment. That should NEVER move once you set it unless you move it. Dial has just the right amount of resistance to prevent unintentional movement. Nice size. Easy to manipulate with light gloves on. Easy to read and quickly find your bearing. The sighting window at the bottom of the mirror is a nice touch.

My only grip are the knobs are hard to adjust. Just the smallest of movements goes from tiny to max flame. They should have made find adjustments easier and some indents to hold the knob where you leave it. You get used to it and for the most part so it's not a deal breaker.

That said, it seems like a decent product. You may indeed want to add a piece of closed cell foam to the seat as it's just some thin material stapled to a piece of plywood.

Taking a look at what it can do, it has a Barometer (which also gives you the current temperature -- but keep in mind for best reading, you need to take it off your wrist for about 15 minutes first), an altimeter which under proper circumstances is quite accurate.  For those who say it doesn't work at all, keep in mind that it takes readings using the barometric pressure, and if you at first do not calibrate it, you simply will not get a correct reading.  Also, keep in mind that as the air pressure can sometimes vary depending upon where you are and the weather conditions you are experiencing, the altimeter CAN vary -- even if you aren't moving at all.  This isn't a defect with the watch, if you need to blame someone, have a chat with Mother Nature, because Suunto has no influence in that department. It also has the cool feature of incorporating a digtal compass, which works (when again properly calibrated) from virtually any position on the globe.  This feature alone makes the buy worth it.

It lists historic sites, natural scenes, camping places, etc. The maps show lighthouses which is really good as I photograph them and more importantly how to get there. They can be used with GPS though I am of the old school and have never found a real need for a GPS device. These map books and the human brain are adequate so far.
8291	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have several pelican cases that I use to haul electronic equipment and other gear for boating.  Given that I sometimes fly to where a boat is located, the cases have to withstand shock from baggage handlers, and protect the contents.  These cases with the foam insert do both.  They are also somewhat watertight depending on how you pack them and the integrity of the gaskets that surround the lid. So far they are the best case I have found for use in a rather hostile environment.

8151	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great compass overall! This compass is overkill with nice luxury features, but most importantly, it is a Suunto, which means you can bet your life on it. Suunto is one of few compasses that I trust. The MC-2G is nicer and more expensive than you really need to go in regards to a well-designed, functional compass you can trust. If you don't care about all the bells and whistles and the need for a Global needle (needle that is designed for both Northern and Southern hemispheres), you would do just fine with the Suunto M-3 for about half the price of the MC-2G, or perhaps the MC-2D/LIN coming in at under $50. But if you're ok dropping around $65-$70 on a base plate compass, you will not be disappointed with the MC-2G.

9605	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The front & rear propellers are soft, and easily jam and stop spinning.  The trick appears to be to twist or untwist their eye-screws to get the right tension on them.  I don't like that--they should be firm, and should work perfectly out of the box without issue, as long as they're not jammed with weeds.  Haven't caught anything on this yet, perhaps because I use it less because of the propellers not both spinning properly all the time.  I'm disappointed.
As a test, after changing the bearings in one skate, I put them both side-by-side on the floor and gave them a push.  The skate with the junk bearings went about a foot and stopped.

The plus or minus sign next to speed to show whether you are above or below your current average speed is sometimes nice to have.  Other than that, it has speed, average speed, max speed, and a totalizing odometer plus a scan mode which switches every four seconds.  I found it accurate especially after bothering to measure the distance in millimeters of one loaded wheel rotation.  Simple to input into the device once you have done the measurement.

291	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I work out 5 days a week, and I use these 3-4 of those days. I've had these for 5 months, and they've held up quite well. I've even used a tricep rope for doing extensions and they've stood up quite well. I'm not sure how long they'll last, but intend to research and see. I did replace the door anchor with the Bodylastics brand, as it is much better made. I have a picture of my door anchor after 5 months use. The stitching where you put it in the door is starting to fray some. If you buy this set, read the directions. There is an ankle attachment as well. I've never used it, so I don't know how well it holds up, but I will say this; use it on your ankle only. I came across a Facebook post on a fitness page where a guy tied the ankle attachment around his squat rack and did chest flys with it. The attachment broke and hit him in the back. The directions don't mention anything about the ankle attachment, but common sense should kick in and tell you not to use it for chest flys. Anyway, if you buy these, do these things: read the directions, and inspect them before and after each use.
Bass will fear you and call you dirty names if you show up with this lure, that much I can promise.

She absolutely loved riding in this little boat and it made our trip a lot more fun! For reference, I'm 5'8 160 lbs, my daughter is 45" and about 60 pounds. It was a little snug so I wouldn't recommend it for a bigger person. I paddled for hours and even dragged it across the rocky beach, and it held up perfectly!

3793	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay away from this board. A good dart board is the single most important factor in making darts fun. Get yourself a Winmau Blade 4 or 5 instead. Sure it's a bit more money but will last WAY longer than this piece of junk. Also, this board has round wires. That means your darts will bounce out like crazy. So get ready to enjoy picking your darts up off the floor. I understand that you might be attracted to the price. But also know that this board will most likely self destruct in a month or so. And if you plan on playing a lot, forget it. This board will not last at all. Spend the extra $25 and get the Blade 4/5.

8224	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very happy so far with this compass! Haven't used it much yet, but everything about it seems awesome and it's more compass than I probably need but it's a very important piece of kit and I'm happy I was able to get something so good for such a good deal. Only thing I'm concerned about at all is winter land-nav here in Michigan with it. I haven't seen a bubble yet, but last winter our temps even here in southeastern MI dipped below -15 degrees F many times and that's without even factoring in wind chill. I'm hoping any bubble that develops in this compass won't be bigger than 1/4" which I've read that as long as it is less than 1/4" you don't have to worry about it. Also, if I move back out west to the mountains I will be wondering how big the bubble gets at even moderate elevation combined with cold. But for most of the year I'm hoping this will work well for me here in MI and if I ever venture to the southern hemisphere or around the world I think this compass will give me Yeoman's service. I did toss the black clip and looped the lanyard through the hole. Much more secure and it doesn't affect the flatness of the compass on a map having it rigged like that. Only difference is you have to take the compass off your neck to use it on a map which is no problem to me. Maybe Europeans who are out orienteering are more concerned about the lanyard mussing up their hairstyle or something when they take the lanyard on and off their head! I can't think of any other reason why that could even possibly be considered as any kind of nuisance. Very happy so far, but I'll update my review if I have too much bubble-trouble with it in the cold. Don't know why Suunto doesn't de-gas the liquid they use in these. It would ameliorate this already great piece of gear.

8305	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I have used it 4-5 times so far but have not yet gotten to 5 bikes.  It will be tight with 5 bikes but I have no doubt it will hold them all.  It is a solid rack.  Quick and easy to attach to my truck.  I used to dread going biking because of the hassle of mounting my old roof racks or taking the cover off my truck and finding a way to secure the bikes in the bed.  Now I look forward to opportunities to use this rack.  My only reservation is it make me a little nervous with the bikes where the cables run under the top frame bar to be basically secured by them.  There are groves which are nice but I wonder for the long term health of my cables to be slightly pushed one way or the other to fit into the groves.  I might end up with another Swagman bar adapter for my bike to avoid this issue.  Those adapters are quick and easy to use (I needed one for my son's oversized frame).  So in summary, if you need to carry 5 bikes this rack is perfect, if you only need 4 I would go with the Swagman XTC-4 Cross-Country.

The space saving, weight avoided and durability is PERFECT if you're looking to get your money's worth while getting the most out of a home workout... such as P90X!!! Highly recommended! :)

9244	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have used cheap and expensive ear guards, but always seem to be coming back to this particular ear guard.  I train BJJ and my son uses this for wrestling.  For BJJ the worries with ear guards would be that it makes it harder to get out of guillatine chokes and triangle submissions, but I would say that this would be lower profile compared to the majority of ear guards out there.  For my son, he seems to like the velcro adjustability that this could be done easily by himself even right before a match.  This is also affordable enough that if you loss it, for the price point, it can be replaced without worries.  My son seem to loss his ear guard every two months, so I own extra pairs of this particular ear guard as replacement.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
1. Your block of "ice cream" WILL be broken into a bunch of smaller chunks.  It is so brittle that they probably all end up like that (this was the first one I ate, but one reason I passed on this stuff so many times is because I could tell by picking up the package that they were always broken).

These are great.
Overall, this is a great stove and a very cost-effective solution to provide alternative cooking methods at home, whether for seasonal use, entertaining or emergencies.  It's a great stove for car camping too.  It's much more economical to use with a refillable tank, and it works better in cold weather than the butane stoves I've also got (you know the ones, they come in a plastic "suitcase" and use hair spray size cans of butane.)  Just add a supply hose designed for it, a flame tamer if you like to simmer, and a propane "tree" if you are using multiple propane appliances off of the single large tank, and you will be completely outfitted!  We also have the stovetop Coleman "oven", which works great with this stove, as well as a propane Pizzaque (which makes fantastic pizza & biscuits btw), so a tree is on our shopping list.

6608	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This review is really more a response to those trashing the knife. Its hard to have overly high expectations for a inexpensive knife like this. This knife is great for what it is. It's a $30 and your getting AUS-8. VERY light duty knife primarily developed for fighting. Again, for the money its hard to complain about this little package including the sheath. Its a great knife to use for small tasks, food prep or basic knife needs. This knife is NOT meant to be used for batoning. All you guys using this for that live in a fantasy world created by youtube that says all knives should pass this test. TOTAL bs. This knife was not designed for that so when I read reviews of people actually mad that it broke I say really? You are mad that the knife broke after you beat it to death when it wasn't designed for that? To be clear, this knife is made in China, so you all can stop getting mad about that. ALL Seal Pups even the Elites are made in China now per SOG's website. If you get one made in Tawain, great. Only the full size Seals are still listed as Tawain per Sog's site. The knife is fantastic for what it is. At $30 bucks I don't see how you can't like it.
Good buy, I would suggest anyone looking for a good "fun" board to play with friends look no further than this board and at 20~25$ its a good price compared to other boards that can run anywhere from 40 ~ 90$.

The sheath is a little weird, but I used the knife to cut the snap and flap off the back of the sheath and only wear it horizontal on my belt.  It's comfortable and easy to get to when I need it.

9491	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good quality Bowstring wax.
Some reviews say the bands are too long or short for certain moves. If they are too short don't double it, instead of stepping on middle and raising both ends, step on one end and raise the other end. If they are too long, like for certain leg moves, then double it. The door strap makes length a non-issue for me, I just move closer or further from the door. For leg stuff without the door, I put the wrapstrap on one ankle, connect both ends to the metal loop and put the middle around the other ankle for side steps.

The red base has a flat surface with the two holes for the hose to be inserted. The hole to the left has the arrow pointing up indicating this is for inflating. The hole on the right side has the arrow facing down to be used for deflating items. The handle is easy to twist off and pull out.

I suggest you dig deeper into and spend the extra money for these Bushnell Binoculars instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bushnell-H2O-Waterproof-Fogproof-Roof-Prism-Binocular/dp/B00CQY7BBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bushnell H2O Waterproof/Fogproof Roof Prism Binocular</a>&nbsp;in the 8x42mm (currently $75). There is such a SIGNIFICANT difference in quality overall, ability to clearly focus, and user friendly features. All the lens covers are attached so you don't have to worry about losing them, and because of this they don't really need a case (in my opinion..). They're water and fogproof, which is great wherever you live (and especially for us as we live on the bay).

It is somewhere around 1.5" to 2" thick (I have not measured with a ruler, just estimated) and filled with a material that is pretty shock absorbent.  Not as thick or absorbent as gymnastic tumbling mats, but much better than some of the other options out there.  I do the various beachbody workouts like P90x and Insanity and it is much better doing plyometric/jumping exercises on it, and doing ab exercises or even yoga on the floor.  You could get 3 or 4 of them and use duck tape to make them into a larger area mat as well.

Although my father's World Class pistol scope leaves nothing to complain about, Tasco does have a less than stellar reputation for marketing sub-standard optics, and frankly, considering how little I paid for it via this site, I wasn't expecting much from my recently purchased Tasho World Class 3-9X 40 scope.

A true breakthrough is that this stove can take regular (unleaded) gasoline, in addition to traditional "white gas" fuel. That white fuel has gone up and up in price. Yesterday, a gallon at my local hardware store was $13! You figure that out, compared to a gallon of gas. To be able to fill the stove with regular gasoline makes this so affordable, and easy to use, with gas you can take from a 5-gallon fuel container, or even siphon from yard equipment or your car.

9586	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Best purchase I have ever bought to protect my boat. I thought they were ridiculously large at first in comparison to some other fenders I have. After using on various docks, they are awesome!! Deliverere fast at fair price.
2. The door anchor is a joke! Number 1 complaint by far. Highly recommend you purchase an additional one for 10-12 dollars more with a big base. Trust me if the door is even slightly looser it will snapped back and it hurts! This was a hotel solid door that it snapped back so not even a hollow inside home door. And yes I double and triple checked that it was solid behind the door but when you are doing multiple reps and pulling at full resistance the door anchor can move to the wrong position.

7163	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this scooter when I was ordering some helmets because we always seem to have extra kids of all ages playing at our house. This purchase was an instant hit at our house. My kids, their friends AND my husband zip around non stop. I love how adjustable it is. It can really be used by a 2 year old or a 12 year old. Then it folds up so small and easily stores in our outdoor toy box. Great addition to our outdoor toys. Very happy with this purchase.
The quality is outstanding and the bang for the buck is awesome. My problems with it are not related to the quality of the product, but since it is being sold as an all-in-one solution, some people might want to consider how they will be using these and adjust accordingly.
6579	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have used this knife for nearly a year for outdoor cooking, splitting small logs, cutting rope, boxes, and whittling wood. This blade is very strong and holds a sharp edge. The knife is very light and carries well on the body either as a sheath knife or wrapped around the neck with paracord. I have found the steel to be quite rust resistant and not prone to damage easily. The rubberized handle has a good grip but is not the most durable material if abused. SOG is a great company and they guarantee most of their blades for life. I have used them at least twice for warantee work and they do a speedy job of repairing/replacing. Of course, the best thing about this knife is the price. I have paid 3 times the price for other knives and then goten rid of them because they pale in comparison to the Field Pup. The blade shape lends itself to do most chores. The only thing its not best suited for is heavy chopping or batoning because it lacks the size and heft.
6989	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My 9 year old loves this scooter. She had a budget version from a big box store that she used for 3 years. Immediately upon riding this scooter she was in love with it. She is super impressed with how much better it rides.


After 10 years, the battery contacts and circuit board are corroded enough that once side quit working.  They do get a lot of sweat in there from wearing them.
7528	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Got this for my grand daughter.  Took her some time to get use to it.  Then the fights started with the grandson who was to little to ride it.  But he tried.  Only thing I didn't pay attention to was that it didn't have a kick stand.  It takes some abuse from falling over.  But she loves it.  Great price.
6507	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great frisbee! It's easy and painless to catch. Also extremely easy to throw. I highly recommend this for casual frisbee throwing.
1388	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	very good and good price.  Plan on buying another for my older Weber kettle cooker that I have reconditioned.
I like that it is sturdy enough for rambunctious kids, and does not deflate even after days in the hot sun.
The one negative is that it's very hard to regulate the output of this stove. There is a very narrow range of the knob between full blast and off. There were a couple of times I tried to bring something down from a boil to a simmer and it ended up shutting off on me altogether. Once you use it a few times you start to get the hang of it, though. I was really glad to have bought this for our trip.
3145	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Super cheap and the rubber tears very easily. I was trying to use the patch kit within 1 hour of buying it.

The burners are Coleman's standard 10,000 BTU units, for a total of 20,000 BTU capacity.. They are well made, super easy to control and produce a LOT of heat. I was able to bring a quart of water from 50 degrees F to a boil in 3 minutes. Simmer control unlike many camp stoves, is fairly straight forward and easy to manage. There are a LOT of competitors to this, and many don't even come close to the heat output, or simmer control of this stove!

5059	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	To keep it as simple as possible the product is a blue padded mat just like the ones at a gym.  The only difference is that this one is only two feet wide and clean.  I wish it could fold into thirds and that the mat was bigger but it works as it is suppose to.  I use it to do simple exercises.
7740	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This respirator is fairly comfy, always seals well, and comes at a reasonable price. I've used it while bleaching mold, spray-painting ceilings, caulking with nasty outdoor-only rated caulk, cleaning with mineral spirits, and it's quite amazing to take it off and realize how much I stunk up the room but didn't know it. Definitely a must have for any DIY-er or professional. I've had one for a few years now and now think it's one of those safety items everyone should have.

Not very challenging if you work out a lot, but it is definitely better than nothing.  Would recommend for the purpose I stated above or for a pure beginner that does not have gym access.

3148	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought 2 of these mats to use for a Girl Scout sleep over at the aquarium.  The girls were sleeping on hard cement floors an needed some padding.  I inflated with a pump ( you need one with a skinny nozzle tip) and it did take a few minutes to inflate them, but they held air and were comfortable.  I would recommend having a separate pillow as this is pretty much just flat.  The mat held air all night and was pretty comfy.

3543	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a cute little soft hockey stick and a super soft ball to smack around with it.  I would have preferred a super soft puck over a ball, but the tiny size means it is meant for the littlest of kids, and they will have fun with it anyway. It is small, a little toy for the toddler to 1st grade sized kids, but not much like hockey.

786	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These resistance bands are nice, but wish they were shorter for what I wanted to use them for. I finally figured out what the black plain piece was for, to stick in a door, in order to use bands that way. I am mainly using the stronger black band with handles and red one to stretch, just using my hands. I guess I need two more handles. I really wanted the chair gym months ago, but HSN would take too long to ship it. The other three bands are okay to stretch together. The ankle strap is okay if you find the right place to use it. The directions do tell you not to wrap straps around any part of body, but I did it anyway. Sometimes you get tired of using the door! The metal hooks along with cloth piece attached to them are nice also, but cloth fits more comfortably having it hang from the larger part of hook.
9443	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I'm left handed and wrist strap releases aren't comfortable, even the ones made for left handed people. I love this release and so does my right handed 10 year old daughter.  If it came with a lanyard or at least the allen wrench to adjust the sensitivity it would be perfect.
But over all, these are a great set of ears to have. I recommend it to any shooter. The low profile and snug fit is fantastic for shooting. Also, I wouldn't recommend playing around water with these. They don't seem to have any type of sealant for water protection, so I wouldn't test that area out.

5965	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Was very hopeful my children could enjoy this trampoline inside during the hot, hot summer afternoons. Unfortunately the trampoline was very difficult to put together. Several of the legs did not want to attach and it seemed warped from the beginning. After just one week of use one of the legs completely folded and bent in on itself. The entire trampoline was completely unsafe for use. However Amazon was excellent and their return system worked perfectly, very fast and efficient.

4904	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great
3195	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have no problems with leaks or anything. Works great and I've within the last few months slept on it so many times. I am 5'8 and 180 lbs. Though I am going to invest in a self inflating one because carrying around a pump for this while backpacking is a pain and blowing it up by mouth makes me almost pass out and takes FOREVER.

8118	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I did not expect a boomerang to be this shape. At first this toy can be frustrating to use because you have to figure out how to throw it properly. I highly recommend to use this toy in a large space because this thing flies up and around is a large loop. You may need to do some tweaking to the fins at the end to make the toy work properly.
It appears to have a metal ring surrounded by some kind of rubbery compound so that it is easy to catch and doesn't hurt your hand. It is open in the middle so it is easy to srap your hand around the ring to throw it. You can throw it side arm like a normal frisbee, or throw it with a baseball throw which works just as good and actually better if you want to throw it out and have it float down to the catcher.

7032	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My son loves this scooter!  It's easy to adjust the height of the handlebars and easy to collapse for storage.  He is 11 and uses the handlebars at the maximum height but it is still a good fit for him.

There are some obvious changes that have been made over the years of the production of the classic propane stove, mostly cosmetic. I do like that this particular variant has a buckle style latch instead of a simple friction catch as I have seen those friction catches fail, a lot over the years.
love these grips
9306	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Good quality; good price. Slightly more visible than I'd like.
The only problem I've had with it is only sort of related to the ball - I took it to my 8 - 9 y.o. team's practice, and at the end of practice, my ball (size 4) was gone, and instead there was the same ball in a size 3.  Obviously, someone picked up the wrong ball by mistake.  So, it's the generic appearance and lack of attention paid by my player to the specifics of the ball.

4342	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This product felt very cheaply made and didn't flex very easily. We treated it with care and yet it still broke the first time we used it, while adjusting its angle after mounting it on our bike. The mirror just cracked into several pieces; some fell out. Since part of why we bought this was that it was specifically described as shatter-resistant, and we're riding with a toddler, this was troubling.
2124	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Got it quick you get what you pay for
Cons:
8329	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Mounted to a 20 year old Marlin 60 using the provided 3/8" dovetail mount with no issues although this set up looks like it could over tighten with a little too much force.  Very easily sighted the scope to 50 yards and the gun was putting CCI high velocities in a tight group.  Great scope for plinking or paper as visibility is clear and bright in the daylight.  Everything was in focus, nice and crisp, no adjustment necessary.  The crosshairs are easy to see and thin down near the intersection.  I found the adjustable eyepiece helpful to set the distance from my eye in the shooters position.  Comes with a clear and yellow protective cap system and you can shoot with out removing these which is a nice way of keeping the glass glean. Windage and elevation require a small screwdriver, but this is common.  Setting these parameters was easy and the settings worked smoothly and yet felt solid.  I found the 9x magnification to be sufficient at 75yards but lacking at 100yrds.
I would NOT (Update Nov. 1st, 2012) recommend this scope for a 20 gauge slug-shotgun.
Things I don't like:
346	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	A lot of pieces = a lot of options = can get cluttered and complicated. I use the red and black bands. I tried contacting the company to get the free orange band that they offer, but I never got a response. Perhaps they will see this review and send me the orange one. I currently use the red and black together. Not sure what the velcro loop is to used for.
I would say if they installed foam inserts at the corners, damages would significantly decrease.  As it stands the only thing protecting the corners is the cardboard box, which isn't even labeled "fragile".
9824	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The rods biggest eye was bent almost flat as well as numerous scratches and dings in the enamel, this is a sign of how bad this product is made and definetly won't stand up to anything more than a makerel.  Was supposed to go fishing today... I guess not... This is absolutely terrible rod and i hope they make this right for me.
946	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The problem with elastic bands is that the resistance changes as the bad is stretched out.  Depending on what you use it for, this may not be a deal breaker.  For stretching and flexibility work it is ok, but if you intend to use it for strength building this is not the right tool for the job.

4846	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Very poorly made. Used it one time and it tore the stitching at the edge the first time someone stepped on it. Don't waste your money.
2495	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Buy it for the fruit peeler.  If it had a corkscrew it would be the perfect pocket knife.
992	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This product is good... Nice price... But not GREAT... It does the job... I had a previous set of these resistance bands and I can say that after a while (1 Year Or Less)... If you aren't careful with the bands... Some of them could break a lot before... So be careful... It's a good product if you know how to use them... I've bought a new set two weeks ago.

6203	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It was very difficult to write a review for this product.  On one hand, it performs well and is well worth its price.  On the other hand, it has a cheap feel to it and it is a bit clumsy (inconvenient) to use.

The remaining 4 whistles were not significantly different from one another and none of these 4 were even close to the top 3, with the exception of the Acme Tornado which, to my ears, was rated the fourth loudest. Not surprisingly, both the cheap whistles were barely heard, but VERY surprisingly, the Fox 40 Sharx was no louder. In fact, my son actually rated the cheap aluminum whistle to be just a bit louder than the Sharx. I rated them the same.
Once I set up the instrument, it worked very well.
It is quite heavy though and I would not recommend it if you're looking for something to carry around if you don't have a car.
Great price too
6102	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Works well, cleaning is a bit of a pain but I also hate cleaning soooo...

8049	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	got one already, got stuck in a tree, I could see it for a long time, lol. then with the leaves coming down and all, it came back to me!!! I bought a replacement in the time being. it has a great response. pretty big/wide flight path so you really should be in a field not near trees (trust me, lol). the wind angle makes sense too, since the way you throw it, the wind carries it back to you on that last turn. the shape of this makes it easier to use than the classic boomerang shape, and while I would only get a few to come right back, I could usually get them close and take several steps to get it, lazy lazy, lol. it is a great beginner boomerang, and is easy enough to use, you probably won't want to try any thing else for a long time.

4595	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Right out of the box this thing is defective. One of the wind shields fell off when opening it. Upon inspection, the one that's still attached is held on very poorly. You'd think they'd have a better fastener to hold on the wind shields, but they don't. I guess that's what we should expect from Coleman since they have their products made in China, which makes them pieces of junk.

4299	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Unlike another reviewer whose review I read, I found this pedometer to be inaccurate.  It indicates many more steps than I actually take and is off by over a tenth of a mile in distance walked.  I was especially disappointed when I learned that a friend and his fiance had purchased a different pedometer (for the same price as I paid for this one) that records their steps and distance travelled extremely accurately, even though they are completely different in height/weight characteristics.  Moreover, theirs has a "talking" feature which tells them how many steps they have taken, etc. And, it looks nicer, with a black and silver case.

The bearings came too crooked to even fit onto an axle so I had to remove them and reset them. The rubber molding is wobbly and has a high spot when spinning (runout) I imagine if I actually used these wheels riding on a scooter I would be bouncing down the road as if they had a flat spot. I didn't return these because for my project it doesn't matter but I wanted anyone who would use these on a scooter to know not to get these.

102	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We purchased this for our 5 year old son - he loves it and plays on this all the time on cold/rainy days. HE has no use for it outdoors or when the weather is better - he prefers the skateboard. Older kids seemed amused with the board, but for shorter periods of time - 5 minutes here and there. The board is clearly not for everyone, but I have found playing a youtube video with some trick ideas helps spur more activity. It's also a good way to practice balance for young ones.

Pros:
8217	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Doesn't have a secure attachment for the lanyard.  My lanyard and compass separated while orienteering and I lost the compass somewhere in the middle of a field.
6747	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Solid set.  Love American made products!!!  Not sure if the pole length is an issue.  We were able to put it in the ground without any problems.
The handle strap on the sheath uses velcro AND a button to hold the blade, its only slightly more secure but it is completely unnecessary and only makes it more difficult to secure your knife
5836	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This looks like a nice set, but I bought it for my preschooler and it was way too big, even wrapped around as tightly as possible. I saw other reviews here that this worked for other people's little ones, but I would not recommend it for a child of average height/weight under the age of 7 or 8...
2347	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I searched probably 100 knives when shopping for this back in 2001. I got it because I loved the blade style. Now, after having used it for daily carry for 6 of the past 8 years (I got a Kershaw Cyclone, black, serrated blade about a year and half ago) I see several other benefits to it.

4411	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Have used this on several car camping trips for over a year.  No problems so far.  Seems fairly rugged.  Easy to clean - although I haven't had to deal with any major messes yet.  It's true you don't have very fine control over just how hot the burners are, but I have found that I do have enough control to do some actual cooking without burning food.  This does more than just boil water.  I've never used the more expensive types of camp stoves, so can't really say whether they might be better, but this has worked well enough for me that I can't imagine why I'd want to spend the extra money on a more elaborate grill that might be more fragile.  I'm happy with this one.
Overall I would highly recommend both 12ft and 15ft rods. They are decent quality and cheap.
7811	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I am using this respirator while cleaning mold and need it only for that reason. Tons of mold spores go into the air when you are cleaning it because they are usually sitting on the surface dormant until they are disturbed. When you use negative air pressure to pull the mold spores outside of the house it is very possible for you to breathe in black mold or toxic mold that could make you very sick instantly. This respirator works very well and is easy to breathe through once you get used to it. Putting on the filters isn't too bad either and you will find it pretty easy. The straps are strong and lock airtight to the face.
8025	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My two year old was all about Dora the Explorer's new fantastic gymnastics episode when Santa brought this for Christmas. At like $7.95 then it was a great little something to put in a box with a new leotard.... Little did I know it would be the hit of ChristmAs! Perhaps her favorite present of all time.
This stove is made in the U.S.A. Those who complain about cheap Chinese manufacturing may have a counterfeit, not a real Coleman. Are there counterfeit stoves out there?

I think the lighter gauge bands are pretty useless for strength training unless you are a petite woman, child, or doing some rehabilitative work.  I'm not exactly sure who uses a 2lb band.  Maybe for stretching?  But the red and black bands are heavier gauge and excellent for male strength training.
1127	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I highly recommend theses bands! I love the door anchor that comes with this set also! I previously used a cheap set of resistance bands (Gold's Gym, I think) and these are so much better. Such a good workout with these!!

Upon shipment arrival my new Spalding Tack 29.5" did need some air but I've found that to be typical plus if you own a basketball you should expect to need a ball pump once in awhile.  I'm partial to "tacky" (sticky) balls because I just seem to shoot better with them (better rotation since I can't palm a ball) - this Spalding was right up my alley with the stickiness factor.  Nice dribble, nice feel - actually the best sub-$25 I have used and probably my future choice for outdoor ball.
802	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was a little skeptical seeing the price of these, but I was really surprised with the quality of the whole kit. Nothing feels like it will break, and it all stows away in its case, which is perfect for living in a cramped apartment. The handles rotated easily, and it is ridiculously easy to setup for your next exercise. I'm 5'10", and it didn't feel like it was over stretching when standing on the bands.

I blew it up with a foot pump. I wouldn't recommend not having a pump as this was even a little tiring to blow up with the pump. My only complaint is I wish there was a bag or container to keep it in. I keep having to awkwardly shove it back in the box it came in and that doesn't offer a sealed way to store it

Sometimes I fold it in half just to sit on the floor with my grandkids. That doubles the thickness and its actually pretty comfortable. One time I got up to go to the kitchen and when I came back my dog had taken my place. Ever since then Ive left it out on the floor for him so he has some support for his old bones. No puncture holes from his claws, so far, but they're kept trimmed pretty short.
A bad purchase and decision on my part!

3176	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for lightweight camping. Fits in a small tent. Long enough for a 6' man.
Factoring in the price I'd say you can't possibly do any better than this. It is a big on the heavy side, but the extra weight is worth it in my book for a good night sleep when hiking 40+ miles.

1983	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product at this price point. Easy easy easy, intuitive. Just open the package and start bird watching. The one-touch focus is a no brainer. Perfect for neophytes and amateur bird watching. The case is adequate at this price point. Relying on the Amazon best seller status is spot on for this product. Knowing nothing about sophisticated optical devices, you cannot go wrong with this pair. Pleased with the fact that you can view crisp, in-focus images without any kind of eyeglasses, regardless of your prescription thanks to the superior focus quality of this item. Only wish is that the lens covers fit a little more snugly, would snap on, and maybe came with attached lanyards for each cover. However, this small fact is irrelevant given the price point, quality and ease of use. At this price, buy several. One for the car, one for the front yard, favorite voyeuring spots around the house, stocking stuffers, office grab bag gift. Affordable, practical, something virtually everyone would find a use for.

2213	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I bought these as starter birdwatching  binoculars for my son who recently got into the hobby.  I got these primarily for the price and the decent reviews, hoping that Bushnell had improved their quality over the last 20 years...  but, I wasn't surprised when my son said that the focusing mechanism broke within 2 months of his receiving them and it wasn't due to misuse or dropping them:  the plastic housing for the set-screw cracked, which no longer allowed proper focusing (and I couldn't repair it).  Actually, I should've known this would happen with Bushnell because my initial birdwatching binoculars were Bushnell and I remember them becoming fairly useless soon after I started using them on a regular basis.  It's been Nikon or Minolta for me ever since...  I guess I  should've started my son on one of those as well.  So, on to the "store" for something better for the new birder.
I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I won't need it. If I should need it however, it's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products. This is a more "handsome" looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades, but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner.
2336	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great knife!  Takes a good edge and holds it nicely.  The SOG sharpener works okay also but leaves a bur on the edge so i recommend using a diamond stone or ceramic sticks to put finishing touches on it.

Thinking about getting a second set so I can have more of the heavier bands. I like how you can combine different colors to get just about any weight.

Cons: I am just worried that the magnet that I have attached to the wheel is going to fall of some day and this would make this whole unit useless. The magnet is in a plastic casing and is attached to the spokes and it does not seem to be very secure.

Features that are Nice, but I don't need:
Pros:
6971	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	No issue with the build quality, but the wheels are pretty small, and it is definitely too small for anyone "grown up size"
1018	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This resistance band set is great. In fact, I like it so much that I'm ordering another set! I love the ability to add weight by attaching another band, instead of having to deal with two handles in my hand (like the bands that have permanently attached handles). The door anchor, and ankle strap work perfectly, and the carrying bag is a nice touch, as well.

Cons:
8041	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my grandson - to keep at my house for when he visits.  Fits perfectly on twin size bed - stays put, even when sleeping or playing inside the tent.  He, as well as my nieces and nephew, love the tent.
7868	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	The battery access (it doesn't come with any) is absolutely stupid. I guarantee you will be breaking the plastic muff ring after it's aged and dried out for 2 years.  I had to view an independant online video on battery replacement because it required a massive amount of effort to unsnap the muff cover the get at the battery compartment, and I'm very surprised it didn't crack in half. PASS.
4350	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertised.  No problem in assembling it.  Very good for people with knee and leg problems.  No pressure on the joints.

4764	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Worked great. I don't know why I waited so long to buy one. It makes camping cooking very easy and the space it takes up is minimal. I would recommend to anybody. It will also make for a good emergency grill to use outside if the power goes out. Only use it out side.
2891	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Fit perfect, just like the originals.
6714	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Well, saved $10 from other places by getting it here and totally love this buy!  Great quality, toatally sharp (including tip) and perfect size.  I've always wanted one of these knives and am glad I bought it. g-
  So when my pontoon steering cable went bad, this is what I went with.  Glad I did, it's a nice setup, and much more comfortable to drive.  You don't need to change steering direction very often at these speeds, and I rarely "grip" the wheel 90% of the time we are driving.
  (c) This little unit is the noisiest pump I've ever owned.  Yeah, all these little inflators make noise, but this one can drown out the noise of a train passing 50 yards away.

3105	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I really like this mattress.  I bought this for a backpacking trip and used it along side of (2) other different types of self-inflatable pads.  Being new to backpacking; I am in the selection phase of having the right equipment.  My wife slept on this one and found it to be comfortable, the built in pillow is nice too especially if you are used to sleeping with a pillow.  I blew it up in about 10 minutes without seeing stars and unlike the thin self-inflators, this offers better insulation, comfort from ground irritants (stones, sticks, etc.) and keeps you out of any standing water that may accumulate from rain due to its height!  It rolls-up tight and is more compact than a lot of self-inflators, but it a little heavier; which shouldn't be a surprise since the weight is specified.  The only question I cannot speak to is its longevity, but given its construction and a bit of care; I don't see why this wouldn't last a while.

I've added several new exercises to my routine as a result of this purchase.  The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5:
1900	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great binoculars for the money. It's a good balance between magnification power and weight. Focus is easy to use and very smooth.

8454	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I installed this on a Ruger Mini-14 (223). It's great from 10-100 yards, very stable and consistent. No drift yet, I've put about 400 rounds through the mini so far. Easy crosshair adjustments.

1128	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is the second set I have purchased and the hooks for the bands are not as nice as the first set so I am only giving it 4 stars so far. Hopefully they last longer than the last set (lasted about 6 months). But at this price it is still cheaper than a gym membership.
2344	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I own several other SOG knives. This is the largest I have. It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring "flip out" operation. This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others. But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand. It is a quality looking knife.
6054	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Worked fine for 3 weeks. Stopped sensing the sensor. I could move the magnet past the sensor and hear its internal reed switch click open/close. But, the computer wasn't detecting it. Computer could be manually turned on. But, still, it didn't detect anything happening at the sensor.
3395	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	my 5 year old son loves it.  he wants to play every weekend with it.
Overall, and I don't think I am overstating this. I am nearly 50 years old at this time, and I fully expect this stove will outlast me, and likely be handed down in my estate. It's just that well made.

2. The only concern for heavier people is that the raft looks funny.  Because the material is so thin, it isn't very rigid.  It doesn't retain its shape as well if you're heavy.  Other heavier reviewers had no problems using it, aside from looking a bit silly.
2613	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought 3 of these for my kids, and they are very good balls to get started with. Good size, not too heavy, and seem rugged. Many memories of Spalding products back to my youth.
7830	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Sure, you can get better hearing protection than this.  You just won't find a better product in the price range.  I know several people with this exact model, and none of them have any issues with the functionality.
1830	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've used this for a few weeks with my T-Ball team.  The bases have held up really well.  They seem to be constructed of durable material and should last a long time as long as you're not using metal spikes.

2514	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I would say this is the perfect size knife to put on your keyring and keep in your pocket.  Just a bit bigger than the ones I was carrying, but not too big.  Two blades, a nail file, scissors, and a few other things -- and of course the toothpick and tweezers.  Perfect.

3742	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I haven't had it long, but I just came back from a 5-day trip where I used this unit multiple times.  It pumped my twin air matress up in under 60 seconds.  One of the guys on our trip was impressed with it so much that plans to buy one from Amazon as well.
Not perfect to play catch with, but it's a great change of pace from a traditional disc.
6220	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use these for playground duty at an elementary school where I work part-time. Highly effective and quite loud with the proper force! No peas to get stuck and the plastic construction is not as cold in the Winter months as a metal one

The binoculars are very simple to use and provide good viewing from moving boat on a stable image off at a distance.  Extremely simple toggle system let me get right on the best focus.  Just press down with either left or right fingers.  I found it much easier than the ring type focus mechanism.  They are quite light as well compared with some more professional/pricey binoculars I have tried.  It seems they were about a pound with case and lens covers.
5686	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great for adults, would have to cut the velcro straps for kids.
I am 5'5" and sitting down, my feet touch the other end of the raft. You could probably fit one adult and one small child or two children.
Anyway, this fits the bill. It's soft, supportive, durable and effective for me. It's a little heavier than the Wave Mat and is perhaps not quite as wide, but it's way more comfortable. It's heavy for backpacking and the valve is, well, it's pretty bad. But for $10 (less than $9 when I ordered), it's an amazing device.
5034	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Comfortable and thick. Very convenient to stow and large enough to do pull-ups and stretches. Looks and feels professional grade.

1764	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These things are awesome.  They clean up, as much as you need them to clean up, with a hose or just throw them in a bucket.  We use them on both grass and the cul-de-sac hard tac and they work just fine.  I'm very happy and the kids absolutely love having bases they can run, jump and stand on.
8235	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is one of the better made compasses on the market today.  It is pricey for what it does.  The MC-2 Pro is exactly the same but the gimbal mount for the magnetic needle is different and does not allow as much verticle movement so it only works in the hemisphere you buy it for.  Unless you are traveling and exploring in both hemispheres, the less expensive version is just fine.  I would recommend either one of these, depending on wheere you plan on travelling.

4199	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We loved to build with this block in the snow, however, snow conditions had to be just right. It didn't work on powder days. We then took it to build sand castles at the beach (another weekend) and it was perfect to build a sand block city versus the usual sand buckets. The snow/sand does go throughout the holes on the handle. When you remove the block, two icicles poke up from the top.

The speakers shut off when things get too loud and they gradually come back on shortly after any loud sounds stop.  Nice natural stereo sound that elimimates the neednto constantly tske you muffs off when chattinf atnthe rangenornwhilst hunting.  They enhance your hearing by amplifying low level sounds.  You can hear a mouse fart if you're wearing these.
6613	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Knife is very nice, but the sheath is terrible.  One of the two buttons was shipped broken, and the other is impossible to open.  Would be impossible to take out a knife in an emergency, or if one was in a hurry.

1130	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Nice handles too.  The clips on the handles make it easy to combine multiple bands for extra resistance.  At the price, I don't see how you can beat it.

First, I was able to put it together by myself in less than half an hour (I'm a 120 lb female). I put the non-screw ends together, positioned the bands evenly to allow the two sides to move easily, placed the two sides together at a 90 degree angle with each side resting in the "curve" of the other, place one foot on the frame on the ground and pushed the other side down with my other foot. The two sides slid right into place . I squatted down and screwed in the screws.

Over the years, I have used approximately twenty different bicycle lights by brands such as Cateye, Cygolite and Planet Bike.

If you don't mind the large mass of four AA batteries on your handlebars and have under twenty dollars to spend, the Bell Night Trail bicycle light is the way to go.

9210	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Very uncomfortable boots.  Metal does not extend far enough on your leg thus it puts a lot of pressure on your calf and shin.  The additional pads are inadequate. I will attempt to modify based on boots i owned years ago

  Now inflating and deflating. I have a special tool for inflating pool floats with a bike pump. Using my large flow bike pump, it still took a very long time to inflate with my daughter and I swapping out every few minutes. We tired of the pump. Deflating was easier by just sitting and folding with the valve open. It went quickly.

2605	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	My daughter said "the grip wasn't the best, and it didn't bounce as well as other balls she has had in the past". She is only ten years old but she loves basketball and the ball was for her so I thought you should hear her point of view. The ball has been serviceable and is very good for the price.  I must also say that it has taken a beating with all my children and the neighbors children as well giving it a torture treatment every day , yet it still bounces and it still is in one piece.
The Bear Grylls has some cool features (like the fire steel, whistle, and sharpener), but you can probably fit at least 2 of those items in the SOG's front pouch, and wear a better whistle on a cord around your neck, and it doesn't seem as well made as the SOG Seal Pup.

Not to be left alone for long in the city.

2087	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a very nice set of binoculars for the typical price this is sold for these days. The focus is fast and stable and offers very good vision and field of view for the amateur bird watchers and more. It comes with a basic case, lens covers, neck strap and tiny lens cleaning fabric. The set is well protected during shipment by its own packaging. This is probably the best one can buy for under thirty bucks these days, possibly even under fifty.

1693	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a great home or school practice net. The metal poles are solid construction and the yellow net is easy to see. This net is 6'X4' which is great for home use because it does not take up the entire yard, but is large enough for practice and play. It contains stakes that keep the net from tipping over, but the poles are heavy enough that it will stay in place under most circumstances. The net is attached with Velcro strips which makes assemble easy, but durability in the weather could be questionable. It comes nicely packed in plastic and can be assembled by one person. Overall the construction, and quality is very good.  The only concern that I have is the long term effects of the weather on the Velcro strips.
7286	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My daughter loves the Razor. It is durable, well made and pink color is nice and bright. Light enough to bring it with you anywhere.

2600	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This ball needed air straightout the box. My boys were unable to play with it and now I need to purchase an air pump. Will not purchase again should have brought from a local store.
Also, you can find lots of videos about how using those bands. 100% recommended.
2114	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Was skeptical due to a few poor reviews. Pulled the trigger anyway and am very pleased. At this price it's a no brainer. Easy lens focus, solid and good optics. Four stars because minor blemish's on eye cups and wish both eye pieces had focal adjustment instead of just the right eye. Like other reviews protective caps not attached. No biggee. Put them in the included carry bag or your pocket/purse.




9065	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I enjoy just wearing these around the house.  They last for years and are very comfortable.  They came in the condition described by Soffe.
These are a great addition to anyones work out gear collection. They are durable and able to fill a variety of roles from additional exercise routines to aiding with physical therapy. A recommended purchase.
I will be using these for a while.
All in all, this compass was a great buy and I like it. Having the 1:24k Romer scale referenced would have been nice given I primarily use 7.5 topos for back country excursions, but the 1:24k scale is definitely not essential if you're familiar with land nav and using a map and compass. And for me, it's not a big enough deal breaker and worth the hassle to return it for the USGS version. I still use an MGRS Coordinate Grid reader/plotter, which references several map scales, including 1:24k. So, receiving the metric vs. the USGS version of this compass isn't a deal breaker for me, but may be for a buyer who really just wants a compass designed for 7.5minute/1:24k USGS topo maps.
The only minor things is that the lock shakes a little but, I couldn't find anyway which would fail.
2745	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Why buy a dumb inflatable pool toy for the kids that will obviously leak or pop eventually when you could buy this cool little raft and actually have fun with it. I didn't know it came with a pump and 2 oars so I was happy when I saw that in the box.
817	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Came right off. High quality.

For the price- you can't beat them. I use them often and have never been disappointed with the quality or quantity of exercises these bands can perform. You will not be disappointed by this product!
7494	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The headset bearings failed after a month of light use. The company does not support this product and sell replacement parts. Stay away unless you like cheap Chinese garbage.

Basically an inexpensive toy for the hockey fan and their children.  Recommended, I suppose they come in other teams as well, but well the Bruins probably have one of the strongest traditions, so a good team to select if they don't make for your team.

If you're looking for a cooler to hold drinks upright, sadly, this isn't it. The few bottles of soda we brought had to be placed on their sides, so definitely no 2-liters, bottled sodas, or beers will stand upright in this cooler. Cans will be fine. The little button on the top of the lid opened the cooler easily, but I can foresee sand or something getting stuck in there and making opening the lid a little challenging, or the button giving out after many uses. So far that hasn't happened, so the 5-star rating remains. I'll update this review if anything changes, but for now, my wife and I are very pleased with this cooler and look forward to taking it out again during our beach trips this summer (and hopefully many more)!
5047	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I own a boxing gym. The prior ab mats lasted me for approx 3+ years. I wish I could recall the name brand they were. These Everlast Mats, I ordered 4 of them, all 4 ripped the very first week. They were not abused, just simply sliding up against the wall to put them away, or if anyone scooted on them, they tore that way too. Very strange.
8923	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Worked out great, color was good, fit was good.
3593	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Best "flying disc" ever (almost said "Frisbee").  For playing catch in the backyard or park or wherever, this is easily the best flying disc I have ever used (I am 51 and have been an avid "flying disc" player(?) since the '70s) .  It is super stable and can be thrown in any number of ways.  It can be thrown very softly and float to the catcher or it can be thrown very hard and fast if that's your thing.  I like to throw it sidearm so that it curves in toward the catcher.  I also invented a new way to throw it which allows it to slowly float to the catcher.
2. hooks on bands are great.

4818	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I've always trusted Coleman for quality. I guess that honeymoon is over. The stove does what a stove is supposed to do, it heats stuff. But I'm really not sure how long it will do that for. There is no quality here. The outer metal case is extremely thin. It had a small dent when I received it and when I saw how thin the metal was I figured I should just be happy it made it in one piece. The hinges for the side pieces are riveted in place....with small, thin aluminum rivets going through paper thin metal....they're all loose...except for the one that had already popped out....that was rolling around the box when I opened it. No blame to the seller here at all. I got what I ordered and the damage was all concealed damage that came about because of poor quality control and poor construction. This is a poorly made product with every corner cut to keep manufacturing costs down and margins high because it has the Coleman name. I kept it because I needed it right away when I got it but I'm back in the market for a new stove and Coleman brand will not be one of my sort options.

As for stride length, the machine generally is best for average framed and height wommen as well as shorter men: Fitness Quest suggests putting one's feet towards the back of the large foot platforms generally helps solve that problem--it's not optimal, but machines at this price and quality level don't offer much adjustment (it's good that the platforms are long and large)....

It has a sturdy steel frame and durable rubber tires, which we expect will last a long time. The adjustable seat has two settings, which is currently on the lowest height so it'll grow with him as he grows taller.  He's able to reach the pedals without issue.  He's about 40 inches tall and 32 pounds.  The seat also sits in an upright position, which I think gives him confidence and comfort while he's riding.  The double deck in the back is also great for another child to sit or stand on.  His 1 1/2 year old brother loves to sit on the back of it.
While I say I am overall satisfied it is mostly for the price and the size.  That being said, these are basically pool floats.  They even have printing on them warning not to use as a rescue or safety device.  I have no idea why they use the word "Fabric" in the description.  One side basically has a pattern in it that looks like denim.  Its all plastic.

2795	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love this boat.  Two brothers use it together and independently to tool around a relatively small pool.  It's their favorite pool toy.  I like that it's big enough to accommodate them both, and small enough to work in a small pool.  The oar locks are a great feature, and easy to remove if we wanted to.  I didn't try the small included hand pump, but am glad to have it to keep by the pool for small inflatables needing a boost.  When using a bicycle foot pump, I did find I had to push right through the one way valve membrane to get it to attach well enough to fill the boat, so the valves are no longer one way and must be closed quickly.  This isn't a problem for us, and is a worthwhile trade off to be able to use a better pump.  It appears to be durable.  No problems so far with rough use by rough and tumble boys.

On Second Thought: I couldn't figure out why I had ordered a set of bands that required metal brackets for a door.  If you've ever used a set of metal brackets on a door, say to just hang clothes, you know that they: 1) scar the door; 2) usually prevent closing; 3) scar the door frame.  So I rechecked the product display on Amazon only to find out that the bands were supposed to come with a cloth door anchor.  Instead, they substituted the metal brackets.  I returned the whole set.  The cloth door anchor does not mar and permits you to use the bands on trips.
Never having used an exercise band before, I went into this experience completely cold, so I offer my observations as a rank novice.

I was looking for something that would hold two large pots, would heat evenly and cook fast. Most importantly, it had to be wind resistant as we sometimes get gusts up to 20 kts.

My one complaint is that the bands are a little longer than  I would have liked. I know many bands allow you to hold them hand to hand around your back and do push-ups with added resistance or other chest exercises. I'm not a small guy and these bands are too long for me to get any resistance hand to hand around my back. It's not a big complaint, more of an annoyance and I guess the length has it's purpose somewhere else.
5192	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I'm still feeling out the grip of this ball and what I think about it.  Change can be hard, and I sometimes want to stick with the traditional grip.  However I have to admit that it is nice to be able to grip the ball better.  I also need to evaluate how well this ball will handle usage.  I play mostly outside which can cause more wear and tear on the ball than indoor courts.  This is probably the most important factor for me, and I'll try to come back and edit my review over time.  I am also still evaluating how the ball behaves around the rim.  So far I haven't seen too much difference in that regard -- I'm trying not to blame the ball for my misses.  :)  The ball has kept its air well note.  I'd say that if you are on the fence with this ball, just go ahead and drop the few dollars and try it out yourself.

I use these bands on these hooks to work different muscles.  I also ordered the FitDeck (I think that's what their called) for resistance bands and it gives me ideas on how to use these bands best.  I looked on youtube too for some ideas.  These bands are actually fun to use.  I have to figure out a certain routine for myself still but I do like them and they seem pretty sturdy.  I store them up on the back of the door so the cats (I have two) don't get at them.  They love things that hang and they attack (ugh).  I would recommend these as long as they don't break easy...if they do, I'll update.

8330	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Let me begin by saying I have many rifles and a range of scopes from the least expensive to high end Leupold tactical scopes. I purchased this scope to put on a 223 Remington 700 stainless varmit and worked up loads based upon the slow twist barrel. This scope has seen hundreds of rounds and continues to please me when I dial up the power to test target grouping. The light transmission is very good up to about 32x and then gets more dim but still useable. In overcast conditions you would probably be better served to keep the power below 32X. This unit represents great value for $150. My Remington is the synthetic varmit model with a Jewell trigger and is deadly within the 223 cartridge limits. I can routinely shoot sub 1/2 minute 5 shot groups with hand loads. You don't have to walk out to check your target, just dial up the power and see the group.

The vice grip type tool that hold the faces flat is somewhat a pain to first set up but works well on repeats. Keeping things lined up while fastening is the hardest part of the job. The pocket joint is very stong and is not that noticeable. Works well in both hardwoods and softwoods with the supplied screws. The screws are also great to use by themselves.

1214	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was a bit skeptical about exercise bands having never tried them. But my trainer at the YMCA thought it would be a good change along with my dumbbell set at home. So I read a lot of product reviews and these were rated highly by people. I like them. I printed off a ton of exercises my trainer gave me and am learning how to do each one. I do wonder if the bands couldn't be longer as the set at my YMCA is considerably so but I guess I get the same workout. I am still playing around with what color (or weight resistance) to use for each exercise. And if I travel on vacation I can take them with me which is cool. So far I have had absolutely no problem with any of the bands - they all seem to be high quality and durable. Let's see where I stand 2 months from now.

  (b) There are no lights ANYwhere to indicate if the battery is charging, or fully charged, or defective.  It has been (I believe) more than 25 years since simple, INEXPENSIVE circuits were developed to show these battery states.  On a $40 inflator, why not spend the extra $2 (or less) to install these circuits and a couple of LED bulbs?  I am positive they could pass this cost on to the consumer -- I mean, who wouldn't pay a couple of bucks more to know how the charge-cycle is going, or to find out the battery is defective BEFORE the next camping trip?
I looked all over the local area for a dual-fuel stove, and all I could find in the sporting goods and discount variety stores were the Chinese-made propane stoves.  Didn't want 'em -- don't want to lug around propane tanks, and I expect to get better gas mileage from the liquid fuel.  Amazon had this Powerhouse in stock, at a $20 discount off of MSRP, and they shipped it to me free in just two days.  All around, I couldn't expect a better deal than that.  We'll be using this hottie for summer and fall camping trips, and while I hope we won't need it for emergency circumstances, we're ready for any future power outages.

Turns out that Leatherman products are not what people make them to be! I was very disappointed with my Wave for a multitude of reasons, which I explained in detail in my review. The interesting thing is that I got a bunch of "not helpful" votes, which is quite funny, considering that a "not helpful" review is a review that is either too short, doesn't provide any real information, or is blatantly biased. Which was clearly not the case with mine. So I can only think that there is a good number of Leatherman fanboys who just don't like to see their favorite product criticized and react by childishly clicking "not helpful".

They are too flimsy and the very limited use of two less than three year olds has already caused them to slant out of true. On the other hand, something about the look of the trike makes it the one my grand kids choose as their favorite. Maybe i will find an old one in a junk store or estate auction.

8457	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	For the price you will have a hard time beating this scope. While B&L's, and Leupolds are the standard to judge by, this scope has in my opinion, held par with them. I own 5 of these on calibers from .17 to .338 Federal both bolt and semi and have yet to have an issue. I have used other scopes in this price range and don't find them to even come close. One even dropped the horizontal crosshair during a hunt from recoil. If you have the big bucks go for the gold, otherwise this is a solid unit at a great price.

3325	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The Intex Camping Mattress is a bargain.  It requires a bit of ingenuity to inflate easily, but once I adapted my little air compressor for the job, inflating became easy and routine (used an inflating pin for a soccer ball and stuck it in an inverted inner top of an eye-moisturizing-drops bottle; the wide end of this soft plastic thingy fits the mattress perfectly).  I've used it on one 5-day camping trip so far.  It is comfortable and firm.  I deflated it every day to conserve space.  Before my trip, I noticed that the mattress loses air after two or three days (one expects this; no big deal).  It's still working fine; the fabric side is grippy enough so that a slippery sleeping bag doesn't slip around, and the bottom side is of heavy enough gauge material that reasonable care will keep it from being punctured.  I'd buy it again.

6665	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Came in a pretty awesome packaging in my opinion but other than that this knife is amazing. It's extremely sharp right out of the box and holds an edge fairly well. I've used it mainly for opening up boxes, cutting ropes/wires, so nothing too intense yet. I'll probably bring this with me for camping if I ever go on one though. Sheath it came with is great but the straps that would lock the blade into place came undone and I had to re-sew one part of it back on. With a little tinkering with rope and the already added MOLLE straps it was pretty easy to turn it into a horizontal sheath on my back. All in all, I definitely recommend this for light work and I can definitely see this holding up to very heavy work.

1.  Needle - Suunto is perfectly level, and highly visible, as it should be!  The Silva needle was also very visible, but dipped down on the red side so much that just a 1/4" tilt of the baseplate caused it to bottom out.  That's why I returned it.  The K&R needle was hard to see because the "doghouse" is a plastic notch on top of the compass dial, and the entire tip of the needle is encased in a plastic luminous material.  In daylight, this made it tough to see, and at night, the needle tip didn't absorb enough  light to make it glow enough.  Double fail.
I've read reviews about the degree lines not matching up, and I was anxious to see if my compass had this issue, but I didn't see any issues with the degree markings on my compass.
691	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very well built . I have large hands and was concerned about the handles but was pleasantly surprised to find the handles are comfortable and strong.

The waist strap is adjustable and the Velcro is very sticky. It comes with instructions that are very helpful. I thought I could just take it out of the package, put the ball in and go but you have to open the hole to fit the ball in. I tried to do it without the instructions and immediately found I needed them. Within minutes he was kicking the ball around. My 15yr old and husband also have used it.

1871	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought these for my wife for bird watching, she really enjoying them. We are not field bird watchers, just observe them at our bird feeders in back yard. These are good for that purpose because of the wide field of view that makes it pretty easy to find what you are looking for out there. It is surprising how difficult it can be to find what you are looking for with powerful binoculars and a narrow field of view. I had a pare like that years ago and traded them as quick as I could.

She's not so good at steering yet but she's coming along. I'd say it will probably be too small for her by the time she's 2 and a half but for the price, its worth the money. It required complete assembly but came with good instructions and will only take about 5-10 minutes if you're minimally skilled with simple hand tools.

A good "BIRDING" Binocular, I use the for "BOATING", they don't take up a lot of room like larger 7 x 50 binoculars do, at 7 x 35 they have the same view as 7 x 50 (you won't be able to tell the DIF bet. 35 and 50 Fld of view). If they go overboard, it's NOT a big loss. excellent gift for a "BOATER" !

This is where the Craftsman really shines. All the tools on it are no nonsense, for real, every day tools. The knife has 2 cutting blades, a wood saw, a metal saw/file, scissors, pliers, can opener, bottle opener, flathead and phillips screwdrivers, chisel, awl and hook (plus tweezers and toothpick, of course). These are all well made, sharp, quality pieces and because it has been limited to these, the knife may be carried in the pocket. This is a huge advantage because it doesn't matter how great a tool is if you don't have it with you when you need it.
2356	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I know this MultiTool is old school but it is very unique. It's somewhat fiddly but once you get the hang of it it's pretty quick and easy to access the tools. It's a little slower to get to the plier head, and it does lack the gear assisted plier design. But...using the pliers is way more comfortable than the SOG pocket plier due to the flat smooth hand griping surface. The pocket plier has sharp edges like the old Leatherman PST. It has a lot of tools compared to it's compact size, and it has room for more like the adapter for the bit tools (accessories available from SOG). When using the blade the handles have some play. This is because the tool uses the two outer tools to lock the handles together better. Since I don't use the file as much I swapped positions of the plain knife with the file. Now with plain knife use the handles with respect to one another are more secure.

It was the perfect size for weeks 1 and 2, and a little bit off for weeks 3 and 4. However, the quality of the band is excellent. It is very sturdy and the handles are comfortable in your hand. They have a lot of different levels of resistance, so you could probably make a good set with these varieties. I would suggest this band, but maybe not for the Jillian Michaels Body Revolution (unless you buy a few).
9635	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I did a dual cable version of these on a hopped up bass boat years ago and loved it.  No feedback does take a little more effort to turn the wheel, but not much.  With this setup you can literally take your hands off the wheel, hit a wave, and the boat will go in whatever direction you left the steering at.  As a side benefit if you do get thrown out, and for some reason the kill lanyard failed, well, at least the boat isn't going to circle around and come after you :)

I pulled it out at the rifle range today during a snow shower and was pleasantly surprised to get a reading of 101 yards to my target from the bench about 1 yard back of the firing line.  The snow did not affect the results of the rangefinder at all...probably had more effect on the bullet path.

6051	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I have used this electronic odometer only once, and after I put all the info into the device (26 inches each wheel) it said that I had ridden my bike (a 26 inch hybrid) for almost 11-1/2 miles. So my unit is VERY inaccurate, since I googled the distance and it added to only a little more than 8 miles - 33 percent less. Other thoughts: As I started to put the computer on my bike I saw that the mounting "hardware" consists of only several plastic zip ties, as though the manufacturer even concedes that it won't last way too long (or perhaps that the user will upgrade to something better?). Everything else that I have placed on my bike has mounting hardware that's much more permanent instead of these small white zip ties.

2483	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought them primarily to play with my 6 year old son who wants to play rough at times.  These are much easier on me than regular boxing gloves or general rough-housing.  The surprising thing is that my 3 year old daughter likes to play with them just as much as my son.  When I arrive home from work, they frequently meet me at the door with the Boppers on and ready to go.  Taking on two kids at once can be a bit of a workout, so that is an added benefit.

The metal version has wider, curved handlebars. It also has a seat that sits further back from the handlebars and has 3 heights.

I'll revisit this review in a couple months to give a accurate update on exactly they held up.
5849	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We bought these for our daughter while learning to ride her bike without training wheels.  They are a bit big for a small 8 year old, but they stay on fine - just a little bulky.  We had a cheap Barbie set of pads that came with some plastic roller skates, but they were hardly padded at all.  These gel pads are well padded and comfortable.

7865	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Thank you for the nice ear protectors! I have already put them to the test and they work great since my ears have become more sensitive over time and a product like this is like heaven sent. I did not mind the battery installation being a little difficult since maintenance of your equipment requires you to know how. It did come apart easy enough once you know where to install the thin flat screwdriver to separate the ring from the cup. I like it's ability to compact to take little room in a range bag by folding up like a ball.
2601	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I got this on Amazon for $9 (and with Prime free shipping). I take my basketball very seriously and this ball has good grip, comes inflated, and feels nice. But then again at $9 its an amazing value and doesn't feel cheap at all.

749	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice set of resistance bands that appear to be made to last.  These are much different and of better quality than the bands you'll find in certain stores.  The metal hooks work extremely well and you don't have to worry about them breaking in the middle of using them, and the handles also appear to be made for the long run. I've used these now for several workouts doing things like face pulls, wood chops, pallof presses and more, and they haven't seemed to lose their shape at all.

5536	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The small Size 4 ball is perfect for preschoolers. Our 4-year-old loves kicking & playing with soccer balls (in fact, she calls all ball games--basketball, baseball, even catch, etc.--"soccer ball" for some reason), but the standard size is a little large for footwork. This one is just right, much easier for her to manage well than the larger balls.
Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.
- door attachment- Mentioned above, but my favorite attachment. A lot of overhead tricep moves hurt my elbow but with the door I can pull down instead and it feels good and strong. I have other straps and resistance bands but these are way nicer. I use the door thing most in the 2 times I've used the kit, and I can't rave enough about it. Use it for inner or outer thighs while standing, to help with situps or add resistance to them, use it to work on pushups while standing, or rowing moves. Its great. You can change the workout just by turning around.
6165	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is my third Victorinox Swiss Army knife.  (I lost the first and still have the second.  I only bought this because I wanted more tools).  These knives are incredibly durable.  I've never had one fail me.  With some imagination, the tools can be used for many more things than their intended purpose.  They are also much smaller and lighter than a Leatherman or similar tool, which makes them convenient to have on you at all times.  They're perfect for those moments when an unexpected need arises and you don't have full size tools with you.

It did take a few tries for me to get it lit the first couple times because you have to have the gas turned on the very least amount it can be, literally only turn the knob one millimeter or too much gas will come out and you will not be able to light it. The flame and heat is very strong, have a good quality pot/pan so you don't scorch your food or the bottom of your pan. I would recommend this stove

The door attachment is GREAT too!  This is a perfect item for any fitness buff.  Perfect for people who travel a lot but can't rely on hotel gyms.  This kit has almost everything you need.  The carrying bag is nice too.

I haven't used the ankle strap, cause let's face it, my legs are legit as they are now.  I'd buy these again, but hopefully I won't have too.
I like that there was no assembly required, so my son was able to hop right on as soon as we took it out of the box.

1227	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchased these bands to use with P90X.  They seem to be well made - I did not feel like they were going to break while I was using them.  The handle can slip making them a bit uncomfortable to use, but that doesn't prevent them from doing the job.  I had never used bands before, but they were much cheaper than buying more dumbells....after a while, I decided I liked the dumbells better.  However; these are GREAT for when I am traveling and want to workout on the road.  I would highly recommend taking a Sharpie Marker and writing on each band the resistance level because unless you use them everyday, you won't remember which band is which.

2020	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Does the job well at a very good price.  The case is light weight, wouldn't provide any protection if you dropped it.  The focus paddle is a bit loose, could be a bit stiffer, I think, for better feel.  There is that black effect that happens if you don't get the glasses at the correct distance from each other, I forget the name for it.  But, over all this is an excellent value product, would have been $140 or more 30 years ago.
2573	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	My kids really like the Spalding Varsity outdoor balls so when their old ones wore out I decided to order some new ones. I however did NOT receive the Varsity ball. What I got was the Spalding NBA Junior Outdoor. Which is similar to the Varsity but the grip doesn't quite feel the same. I'm just going to live with my purchase because it was only $13.99 and do not want to hassle with returning it.

9653	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I didn't buy this item from Amazon but I have fished with it.  I first recieved the Hi-Seas Grand Slam brand of fishing lines as part of promotion for buying a fishing reel on another site.  I had little faith in the line since it was a promotion but used it anyway.  I was so impressed I decided to try their black widow brand.  I bought the 12lb test and have caught a few striped bass in the 12-25lb range with ease and no breakage.  I use a improved clinch knot and it very easy to tie, does not slip or break when tightening my knot.  Only problem I had at first was wind knots but that might have been because I put on too much line, I'm not use to the thin diameter when compared to regular mono fishing lines.  Because of the thinner diameter you can have a little more line on the spool than standard mono which is ofcourse thicker, but after cutting off about 10-15 yards wind knots were no longer a problem.  The line casts very well and smooth, even into a strong wind.  As mention above, the line is very strong and I have caught 3 stripers well over the 12lb test rating.  All in all, a great fishing line at a great price.  Its half the price of braided but with almost the same qualities.  In my opinion you can't go wrong with any of the Hi Seas mono fishing line brands.

4781	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased one of these for a camping trip in August.  I tested it before I left and noticed that even on low the flames looked really fierce and hot(and loud), like a jet torch instead of the nice mellow low-setting flame on a kitchen stove top.  I figured I was being a bit picky and it would probably be fine.  Well it wasn't.  I was constantly burning the outside of all my food(and I do know how to cook well enough to not burn everything) on the lowest possible setting.  And the lowest possible setting is very tough to get on this grill.  The flame would go out almost every time I tried to adjust to flame that low, and that caused another problem.  The only "pan" I brought was a cast iron griddle. Now I have a burning hot cast iron griddle with food on it that I have to pick up in order to relight the flames that just went out.  I have heat proof gloves for this, but the grill got the cast iron so hot that the gloves that are rated to 480 F started to melt.  Needless to say cooking was the worst part of that trip, and it took a week to get the taste of burnt cooking oil out of my mouth.  I returned the product to Amazon as defective very soon after the camping trip.

I didn't put too much lube on the O rings, and with my fingers I wiped it around the rings leaving only a light coat.  Then reassemble.  Now the valves can be adjusted neatly and precisely to reduce flame for simmering and easier control.  I don't know if the factory used a valve lube that gives the valve that rubbery feeling that makes it hard to set the flame precisely, but once I did this operation the stove is a pleasure to use.  If it needs to be repeated the job takes only a few minutes with few tools.  Hope everyone finds this post without having to go through the learning curve.  Please give a thumbs up to save everyone some trouble.  I changed my review now from 1 star to 4 star and think in the long run this is the best propane camp stove out there and will last longer than my Blue Rhino...which was good but the regulators flake out much too soon to be considered a good long term stove.  BTW, this stove is for our outdoor kitchen (under the porch and not in the rain) and we use it almost daily.

I used a microfiber cloth I used to clean my phone screen to try to clean off a bit of water to avoid a water stain. I tried to clean the right goggle, as you can see it scratched it up irreparably!! They work great and don't fog for me. 2 stars because I will be seeking a new pair in form of replacement if at all possible because this isn't acceptable. You can't expect someone to not try to maintain their equipment but ruin it as such when an attempt is made. No, it isn't just dirty it became scratched from a harmless cloth!
These take a long time before they fog up, and many times they don't at all. They rarely leak. They stay snug without feeling too tight. None of this is 100% though. Some days one of these things seems to happen, but it is never consistent. It probably just has to do with how I put them on.
6725	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol. This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster. Held its edge, the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet, this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments.
5311	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I lap swim 1-3x/week, 1000-2000yd each time. When I first started my swimming routine, I bought these goggles.

6044	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	As with all the bike accessories that are in the big-box discount stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Meijers, etc. (and the bikes, themselves, for that matter), this speedometer is designed primarily for casual or child use. Keeping that in mind, here are the negatives:

8120	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The instructions on this boomerang are so easy to follow that my 12 year-old daughter had it coming back by her third throw. Compared to all the other boomerangs I have seen, it is the best flying at a low price. It is very forgiving when thrown at angles causing it to dive. The instructions on all my wooden boomerangs warn that at a certain angle, they will climb to their last flight and dive to the ground causing them to break. This one has hit the ground like that with no damage. It is best to throw it in a big, wide open field, as it flies quite far with minimal effort, and as it is fairly soft, it may be best to avoid direct impact with surfaces hard, rough or sharp.
5889	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	They fit my six year old daughter just fine. Given their adjustable nature they would probably fit kids as young as four, depending on size. The elastic in the straps is strong enough to hold the pads in place, but not so tight as to cut off circulation. My only concern is with the propensity of the Velcro hooks to pull up strings from the straps. In time this will probably cause these pads to become unusable, but careful use and storage should extend their usable life long enough to justify the expense.

8299	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	First- Mounting system to the vehicle is iffy.  The Design Crew at "Swagman" state that the correct way to install hitch bar into our standard 2 inch receiver is to use the threaded hitch pin.  This means that there are only 2.5 inches of the hitch bar inside our factory mounted Pathfinder's standard hitch.  The threads make the bar tight in the left to right motion, but it remains very wobbly in the up and down motion. We do not trust the 2.5 inches to hold the rack loaded with our 5 bikes.

Bottom line is that unless you are ultra serious about your hobby and/or want to impress those who are impressed by such things, i.e. expensive stuff, then I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this unit.  Will I buy it?  Probably as I need another back-up scope and when I consider the price an then the quality I am getting for my dollar, this is attractive.

Free shipping on knives would be great, too, but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items.
139	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I'm doing some upper body rebuilding after an injury and thought I'd try the Black Mountain Bands. I find them a great alternative to free weights and something I can pack easily when traveling. The door anchor that is included can be used both in a door stop or you can slip a dowel through the loop to stand on or to use under a door for a different pulling angle. I have two bands now and intend to purchase more as my resistance needs grow. Also, you can actually double up the bands as the pull handles are padded enough to hold two in your hands (I wear medium sized gloves, so smaller hands might have trouble with this). Also Black Mountain makes a set with removable/swappable handles to make multiple-banding easier.

 Unfortunately, instead of popping a door open and swapping the batteries, you have to pry the inner ear cups out, which sucks to do, and then swap out the batteries, then pop them back on which takes a bit if you are doing it for the first time. After you do it a few times, you get the hang of it. But still, there could have been easier methods to change the batteries. Also, make sure that these things are off, because if you leave them on, battery acid tends to leak. And the product packaging says to take the batteries out when you aren't using these. Really? yea right, like i'm gonna sit there and work to pop the batteries in and out of the pain in the (censor) process.

5500	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Whoever designed this at Rubbermaid needs to be promoted or at least rewarded.  The design is a perfect solution to tight space behind the seat of your car or truck.  Why?  A. It is simple.  B. Rubbermaid resisted the urge (I'm guessing here) to install a drain plug.  A drain plug would only be one more thing to break.  This cooler is light enough and ergonomic enough to enable one to pick it up and pour out the water while holding back the ice with their hand.  C. It is essentially, an insulated rectangular bucket with a lid.  D.  Oh and by the way..the lids are well designed too.  Why?  Well, there are two lids, side by side.  So one can be opened by the person in the beach chair or passenger car seat without needing to open the entire lid to reach for a beverage or baby's milk.  E. The keeper is a good design as well because it can be used to secure the lids in place.  Then, after use I use the keeper to hold open the two lids to dry out the cooler.  It insulates well.  I have been surprised of the need to dump ice after a two day trip in the mountains.  This cooler is never out of my Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.

I use it with my exercise video that requires one. The first one broke after 8 months of use and the second one is already splitting in places and looks like it will break any day now. I've only used it for 4 months. I will have to try a different brand because it should really last longer than that when used properly, as I do. It hurt when the first one broke. It snapped during use and smacked me on the leg. (Imagine a VERY large rubber band snapping you from fully stretched) So, needless to say...I don't want to experience that again.

1643	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This 12 x 6 Franklin Premier goal has impressed me with its quality.  The frame is black, powder-coated steel that is solid and durable and fits securely together with 8 screws with wingnuts (2 in each corner) that hold it tightly in place.  It stands upright with no leaning or wobbling.  This is a higher quality than previous Franklin goals I have used.  It is an improvement for sure.  It assembles in about 10 minutes.  The only weakness is the set of velcro straps that secure the very good net to the frame.  These will fail over time, and I suggest buying some zip ties for a lasting means to connect the net to the frame.  It comes with six steel u-shaped stakes that hold the goal structure firmly in place.  These are needed with kids 10+ years old.  I think this is an excellent backyard or schoolyard goal and can be used with small sided games for youths.

I had looked at the higher btu stoves, by Camp Chef & other manufacturers.  They are a lot more expensive, and somewhat a PIA to pack up and take camping due to their bulk & more complicated set up process.  Canners love them because of that high btu output and their ability to manage very large canners & pressure cookers.  They also work great for cooking large quantities of food.  The problem was that I wanted a multi-purpose stove for cooking for 2 people, camping, and canning...all in one.

3501	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My bike broke the day this light set came in the mail.  That might make you think it wasn't useful, since I haven't had a bike since, but that isn't true at all.  This light has a low powered LED mode for when the batteries run low, and it can last nearly a week left on when in that mode, bright enough to do autorepairs under or navigate around the woods.  I use this light during blackouts, as a nightlight and as an emergency hazard light in my car since it has a strobe feature(the headlight I mean).  The taillight is useful only for a rear hazard light that I keep in my back window ever since the electrical system in my car went out and I was stranded with no hazards to warn other drivers.  Even the taillight is bright enough to use as an annoying red flashlight in an emergency (an I have).  The only downside to this light is that there is a nicer one, also by Bell, but I was too late to get it as I already have this one.

Keyring--sure Victorinoxes made before 1969 had a much more durable lanyard bail.  In most cases, Swiss Army knives other than Classics would be way too big for and likely weigh more than a typical set of keys. I personally use the keyring as a lanyard bail.

When it became apparent that it was finally too small, we bought her this new one.  It was purchased in September of last year and ridden occasionally. Last week, she was riding it at the park, and pieces began coming off. The cotter pin, the bolt thing that goes through it, the spring... We had to go on a major hunt to locate all the missing pieces. Fortunately my husband was able to repair it - however, for the retail cost of these scooters, I find it inexcusable that they can fall apart so easily!

I don't see any sharp pointed areas etc. Encourage a love of hockey at a young age.
UPDATE: June2017. My review has changed with this 1st time out fishing this year. The line spool (which moves up and down along the main shaft) has begun to have a pronounced tilt on the shaft as it moves. This results in a rub against the bottom surface of the pickup rotor assembly with each crank rotation, and in a bit of resistance in the turning of the crank each turn.  Lubrication of parts is sufficient, but it appears that the fit of the Spool is just sloppy on the main shaft.  I believe that the "extra noises" which I had mentioned in my 1st review last Autumn were directly related to this problem.


The fact that it comes already broken up makes for easy eating.  I can munch a piece at a time rather than eating the bar all at once.  It makes it last longer.

This is probably because the water seems so "pure" and clean.

On the positive side, the metal guards are better positioned than previous models to block wind from the sides. This stove seem to use propane more efficiently than our previous stoves but that could be due to age/wear.

We took them to the gunsmith and the same thing. He recommended throwing them in the trash because he has never been able to make one work. EVEN Master Lock themselves could not give one single example of a gun these would actually fit well . The fine print that comes with the locks state the same basic thing. Folks there are much better locks out there for the same or a bit more money. If you have a magazine type that a cable lock will fit that is a much better idea for them. Look for a lock that has two posts, one to fit in front of the trigger and the second to fit behind the trigger immobilizing the trigger itself.  A gun case is important as well however if you have the weapon for home defense you cannot actually keep it unloaded in a case or safe and actually think you would be able to get it out and loaded before the bad guys get to you or your family. I believe after a break in the average time you have to be prepared to fire and defend yourself or family is 4 SECONDS. Have something that will allow you to defend AND secure the firearm. Herters has a nice electronic safe that will pop open instantly with a wrist bracelet or finger print. Many other examples out there as well but please, If you need a trigger guard for local rules then find something that will actually secure your weapon and not just look like it's secured. The life you save may be your own or a family members.

Several complain about a lack of durability and/or lack of quality in the construction.

2185	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for my son to hunt with. I got a pair for safety award from where i work. I could buy a more expensive pair but these work for what we need. They work great early in morning and late late when it is hard to with just my eyes. You can see better when it is getting dark a few minutes when the deer seem to move more. Especially when it is bucks only you need to know not shoot.
5819	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I bought these for a seven year old who is learning to skateboard.  These are not a great fit (much too big) for his legs, and the plastic dome portion just slips around.  He also has trouble putting these on himself and it takes me quite some time to help him.

3669	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for a lightweight backpacking snack. From what I remembered as a kid they are very tasty, and I was not disappointed! I've read other reviews complain about they come broken apart - but that's normal/acceptable - it in no way effects the quality of this product. The packaging of this is bulky - almost 0.4oz per! Luckily this product stays fresh in just a ziplock bag for at least a week. I put most of these in a gallon ziplock and saved several ounces in weight over ditching the stock packaging material. Gave some to my son and he loved them as well - they make a great/unique gift to kids.
3792	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Board is holding up pretty good so far, i tend to play on it every weekend with friends. I do get a few bounce outs around the bulls eye area but thats expected due to not going with the more expensive one with less webbing. The darts it comes with are decent for starter darts. I would recommend this board to anyone.

Surprisingly, the tops and bottoms of the pole are not interchangeable between the two poles. One didn't fit the other at all.  I put a little nail polish to distinguish between them, problem solved.  Also what other folks are saying about needing a light (very light) sanding and some lube between the pieces is spot on.

6200	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	This is a cheap pedometer.  I can't speak for how well it works because it broke less than 10 minutes after I opened it.  Setting it up was relatively easy.  There are no labels on the casing.  So once it was clipped shut, I had no way as easily identifying which side to open from.  Sure enough, I opened up the wrong side and exposed circuitry.  I snapped it back shut, but now it doesn't work.
2543	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Pump is large and inflates items well, however, the handle broke after using it only 5 times. Do not buy unless you only need it 4 times.

9810	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Bought two of these for my sons, 4 and 6 years old.  They love it.  It has a real look and feel and the darts (arrows) fly fast and pretty far.  I told them this was their training one and they take it very seriously.  The darts destroyed the target, ripped right through them after a day of use.  My only complaint is with the orange sight...the arrows knock it off every 10th shot or so...annoying, but easy to replace.

7747	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Good hearing protection. While not the same as the older 7s models, these still perform pretty well. Smaller design and they do exactly what they're supposed to do. Pretty comfortable to wear and they adjust easily.

The garage contains 4 balls, each of a different hue. So it is only natural to level up and buy a full-size soccer goal for my backyard. I had my eye on this for awhile. All of my requirements were satisfied:
The blades--typical Victorinox.  For some reason, this "used" knife was still razor sharp with what appeared to be the factory edge despite being heavily used.  The large blade has an umbrella stamp that my Fieldmaster doesn't have, which I guess was typical of older knives.

6127	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Glad we bought this size. Great heat output and also simmers very well. We use it while car camping, but it is nice to that we can use it if the power goes out to do some cooking. I'm not a big fan of a lot of the camping junk that coleman slaps there name on, but this stove is awesome.  And no other brand has anything like it that I've seen. I've only ran coleman gas through mine. Works well and cleans up nice. I do recommend this to friends.

8564	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This has been a great addition to our hoop--works perfectly and provides a very consistent return.  Our hoop is at the edge of a back deck, and this keeps us from having to jump down from the deck to chase the ball.  The product is made of lightweight plastic and seemed flimsy at first, but it looks like it will hold up for quite a while (we've had it for a month).
That same afternoon of my first test, I stopped at a Subway for a 6-inch sub. The LCD screen had pretty much turned black from sun exposure, and the heat was focused into the center portion of its screen. After about 10 minutes I started being able to read the numbers again.

3339	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Simply the best.
Pelicans seem to be worth the extra 30 bucks and (hey look) made in the USA so the polymers won't degrade, weaken and crack after two years.  Fine job - I will be getting more for my permanent storage items I no longer wish to keep in wobbly Tupperware muy Grande.

5070	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	We bought these for my son for his halloween costume. They were so inexpensive, we assumed that they were just for fun. Turns out, they are the real deal. These are super high quality. Unfortunately, my son now wants to box. He puts these things on and then goes around punching his sister. He tried hitting me a few times, but I got all Mike Tyson on him and bit his ear. Luckily, these gloves added such a realistic touch to his boxing costume that they took the attention away from his mangled ear.

4662	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	You get what you pay for but I was hoping for a bit more with the Coleman brand.  Structurally this little stove seems sound but mine has impossible to control dials.  your gas is either full blast or off.  Spend a little more and get a lot better.
I would recommend this knife to any LE Officer. The serrated top edge will cut away a seat belt in an emergency but does not take away from its tactical capabilities.

The price is so low that you don't have to work at convincing bicyclists to look out for drivers who need to pass, to look out for that big truck that might run them over.
1959	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Love it. We purchased the Bushnell Falcon 133410 Binoculars for amateur bird watching and hopefully for star gazing. And it works wonderfully. The binoculars are little on the heavy side but easy to adjust focus and to use. The case and strap that came with the binoculars are of mediocre quality. It would have been helpful to have a more sturdy case and strap. Furthermore, you will need to attach the strap to the binoculars upon first use. Simply unfasten each of the buckles and slide each each end of the strap through the slots located at the bottom of the binoculars. Then, run them through the buckles twice before adjusting the length. The binoculars also come with a cleaning cloth and 4 lens covers. The lens covers fit easily but not a tight fit and can fall off easily. Hence, one less star based on the above observations for the accessories.

This trampoline is quiet - so it is good to use while watching TV.  It makes a sort of wooshing sound, but since there are bands rather than springs it is minimal.  (Springs tend to be squeaky.)  It is a bit large, but it has not presented any problems for storage.  When I want to move it out of the main room, I turn it on the side and roll it down a hallway and into my bedroom closet.  You could also easily remove the legs and slide it under a bed.
I do recommend  although I haven't used it for long so time will tell.
1908	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Took them on a hike today and must say they are very nice. Watched a turkey and some squirrels from a distance and was impressed with the clarity and how close they project. Defintely worth the little money the cost.
2616	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Kreg at a woodworking show where Kreg offered the usual special combo of the jig, extra clamps and supplies, etc.  It rapidly replaced my biscuit joiner as the tool I reach for first.

Warranty - Well I finally was able to break one of the bands, the one I use most often.  I emailed the company and Rich, the customer service representative, had a new band out to me in less than 24 hours.  No questions asked, no issue, no worries.  This as to be the best warranty experience I've had with any company.  I will continue to give my business to Black Mountain and recommend them to my friends.

6723	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great knife.  Not sure about the mixed reviews on the sheath.  I optioned for the Nylon with a plastic insert (where the blade goes in).  Works great and feels like its built to last.
1862	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This binocular is really nice. Sharp, easy to focus but, best of all, very bright image. I gambled on the junk Vivitar 7x50s for slightly less and they were a joke--hard to focus, very dark image. So I bought this bushnell for barely a ten spot more money. Wow, very bright image, focus dead on and easy. As others have said, this is all the binocular a casual user will need. My wife's 10x25 Nikon for twice the price (also on Amazon) are very nice and light weight especially if you need more power. But these Bushnell's are the best value for sure. Bright and clear.

3773	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I'm reviewing this dart board from the standpoint of design and quality, but not from any expertise in dart throwing.  It's a good, solid (heavy) dart board made without staples, which is important for obvious reasons: it doesn't rip and tear around staples because there are none. Rather than being cardboardish as many boards are, this one is made of Sisal fibers, for strength.  It's probably going to last a lot longer, even with frequent use. Just being stored can age those made with cheap material.  You get 2 sets of 3 darts. This company makes good equipment and I'm very pleased with it.
I bought this product from target, actually, and they only sold this brand so I didn't have the chance to check reviews, etc, or go with a more trusted brand such as kryptonite. Don't make my same mistake!

8673	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	this equipment is definitely effective, it really tests out your strength, the best part is that it's durable and challenging. I would say that the length is kind of short, I would suggest adding two or less inches to it because if you're a tall person, well you won't like this much because it's not that tall at all, but it's a great quality and really durable. I have had mine for a year and over now, and still loving it. So I would recommend this to someone that isn't 5'9 and over tall

8337	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I recently had my old Weaver 4x scope break through contamination of the gases inside. It was over 40 years old. I could not find another Marksman model scope like it. Thought of this Bushnell loved the price it turned out to be a bigger better looking scope more stock features. Came with scope mounts, I am a big fan of Kwik-site Corporations see thru iron site mounting systems that was on my rifle. Don't know what I will do with the mounts that came with the scope. My Kwik-site's don't match the scope perfectly but I only use the scope to spot squirrels in the trees and drop my eye to the iron sights to make clean shots anyway.

Another reviewer felt that this rebounder isn't durable enough for serious soccer, and they may be right; I don't plan to take this out to team practices, but you can tear up just about any equipment if not treated properly.  It handles hard shots from me just fine, even the ones that plunk off the bars.  I just don't see this being an issue unless you're shooting from close distance with maximum velocity.  That's not what this device is intended for.  Use a real goal for that type of shooting.  At this pricepoint, I only expect this rebounder to last a couple years max, any more is gravy.
5430	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great goggles. These do not hurt or pinch my face.  I swim about 3x a week and would not be able to do so without these goggles!
While this is a great little tool, I have only ever used the knife, scissors, and flat head driver. The extra weight of the unused tools is quite noticeable on my keychain. I will be switching to the SD classic.

7679	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great mask. I primarily purchased this to use when power washing tractor trailers because I use some very corrosive soaps and aluminum brighteners (containing hydrofluoric acid) to clean the trucks. I have one for both myself and my helper. We both have large heads and facial hair but I still find that the mask creates a good enough of a seal that I do not smell any of the vapor, or feel effected,  from the chemicals nor do I feel like anything is  getting into the mask. I have also found myself using this whenever Im doing woodworking projects or even cutting my hunting arrows. Just whenever I feel like my breathing and lungs are at risk this is my go to. It is very lite and non-intrusive. My favorite part is that it doesnt fog up my safety glasses or sunglasses when Im using it. Cant tell you how frustrating it is to be working, sweating and not being able to see jack in front of you. With these thats not an issue with it exhalation valve in the front. Not like wearing a paper mask where everything escapes through the top and into your glasses. Also its easy to just pull the top strap off you head and let the mask just hang when you are not using it. Im constantly putting it on and taking it off so its nice to have it hanging their comfortably and not being a nightmare to put back on and take off time and time again. It is 100% worth the money.

3565	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The 5- and 3-year old grandkids love using these sticks and balls for indoor hockey.  The balls are soft, and the sticks are padded -- which may help to minimize damage to the kids and the house.  The plastic covering looks like it may not last, however.
5828	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good product was exactly as we expected. No problems getting it when we needed it we are happy customers :)
1482	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The board and cylinder have been designed pretty well.  The cylinder is made up of discs that are held together with a long bolt with washers.  I would have preferred a more solid piece, but it is ok.  I would recommend this product to others to improve balance and coordination.

The sizzors problem I fixed by getting a leatherman Micra. The rest  I just live with.

9275	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	as advertised
9170	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I can cast it relatively far and it does help catch fish.  If you get no strikes after working an area, nothing else will work.


7200	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic basic scooter! Very sturdy, very rugged. It's held up to a lot of drops, a lot of riding, and a lot of fun.
  I installed this on my 17' Boston Whaler with a 70 hp a few months ago. Ive now got 50 hours on the new helm and could not be happier with the decision to spend the extra money. The previous owner of the boat had a regular steering system on it and the boat would pull hard to the side if you ever took your hands off the steering. A++++
9450	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have put 500 arrows across the FlipperRest II  and it has taken a few knocks in the field - still working well with no damage to flights. I cut up the old leather pad to make a cushion (no plunger installed) and that has worked. The Flipper replaced a bear rug and the improvement in grouping was immediately noticeable.
Resistance:  I am a serious weight lifter.  These were able to take me to failure and kick my butt! (Also able to figure out ways to do cardio type workouts with lighter resistance bands and hi rep exercises)

4611	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This stove is awesome. Very Durable, Reliable and Portable stove for all occasions.  This is my second one purchased. I use this stove on planned  camping trips, spontaneous one day trips and as an outdoor Kitchen to compliment my grilling area.  I would recommend this product highly.
6759	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This Horseshoe set is heavy duty. After getting the stakes pounded into the ground my cousin and I played horseshoes for hours. I live in the desert so the shoes took quite a lot of abuse, hitting rocks on the ground, and they didn't miss a beat.  This set is great.

6359	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Ive owned 2 of these and you have to be very careful if a less experienced person throws it and it happens to glance off a tree chances are the solid internal plastic ring snapped. It is very cool while it works but is very delicate I wish they made a more sturdy version.
8661	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Recommended by my PT to help with balance.  I use it every day as part of my morning routine and It definitely is helping.
We live on a calm lake, but because waverunners and power boats often violate the no wake zone close to the seawall, this 'boat' stays in the pool. And visiting kids just love it.
3142	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works great!  For the price it can't be beat.  I recommend a pump though.  Also, this is a camping pad, not a twin blow up mattress.  It is more narrow, but good for smaller people and kids.
9329	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	The standard for fishing line for many years.  I've been using it for over fourty years myself.  Can't go wrong
