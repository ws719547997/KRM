It's nice to be able to do all light work such as mounting raceway or putting together furniture with just one tool.  So far, it has been excellent and it's the first tool I grab when having to do any work that involves screws.  I also had to install a threshold in the patio and this is where it really shined.  I adjusted the torque to its maximum and set the speed to low and was able to drive the screws two inches into the concrete (holes were predrilled of course).  Not a problem and it stopped exactly where I wanted it too.  This was after my 18 Volt drill ripped the head off the center screw, though.  Oh well, you live and you learn.

6853	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this ladder about 8 to 10 years ago to use in my business.  Thank goodness I haven't needed it that often as after only a few uses, the plastic sleeves that align the sections started unseating causing the ladder not to be able to fully "nest".  You can take off the feet at the bottom and pull the sleeves out until you get to the one that has unseated and gotten misaligned, reseat it, which is not always easy, replace all the others above, making sure that each one of them is properly seated, and it will then become useable again for a few more times, if you're lucky.
6643	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I frequent a woodworking supply store and look at every table they have. I've never seen a Rousseau setup put together to compare. I just went by the reviews and the claim by the manufacturer. It sounded like a good buy as well as a good idea.
Blade change is relatively easy. Two thumb screws, top and bottom secure the blade in place. Clearance to the lower thumbscrew is good but not superb. The upper arm pivots up so you can position your work piece for inside cuts without having to completely remove the blade. Simply loosen the top thumbscrew for the blad, lift the arm, set your work, lower the arm, tighten your blade and go for it.

For many of us we have multiple routers, generally sitting in their cases until used.  I thought this was just the reason to put one of them to better use.

So why the four stars?!?!?!  Well, as stated, this model has been around for a long time. I mean a *very* long time.  Long enough to design an improved case layout to allow for an unshifting collection of bits and a special place for the very shiny, but not-so-cheap and decidedly overwieght close-quarter angle attachment with that odd thumb? brace that usually manages to fall off before you reach whatever it is you're trying to reach.  Battery life is fair, not great[you will need the two batteries], and the charger could be faster.  These issues may appear nitpicking to some, but for the hundred bucks Milwaukee has been collecting for each of these and for the three decades they've been collecting, are these things really too much to ask for in return?

4279	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I looked at the PC, and did not like the plastic components on the fence.  I already had a DW, and was not happy with the alignment problems between the fence and the blade.  Of all three, the Makita is the best.  The fence is attached to a surface machined parallel to the blade, and is also more substantial than the DW.  Don't  worry about the lower amp motor, as the blade is very high quality, and the wood from the slot comes out as shavings, not chips as in the DW.  I like this tool.  I would buy it again.  I can't say that about the other two.

3363	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am a BEGINNING woodworker, and it only took about two pain free hours to put this base together flawlessly. A stop at Lowes (the hardware superchain with the blue and white logo, in case the name is removed), and I had the 2 x 2 x 36 inch oak struts (finished size 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 x 36) that I needed right off the shelf for about half of the cost of the base itself. The unit levels perfectly and rolls effeortlessly. It stays where it belongs even though my shop calls for the base's movement to be in the same direction as my cuts. It will move if you push real hard, but this is more due to the fact that it is presently on polished floors than anything else. On a concrete floor I do not believe it would budge. The base is absolutely steady. And, if you ever need to use it for another machine, all you'll need is to either recut the existing wood, or get new wood. As I stated, a great product.
At first we were worried that these 25 W bulbs would not be bright enough but not so - they produce a nice, even and bright light and don't cast noticeable shadows like the 40 W bulbs did. These are much more suited for the job and also work well for makeup application. Recommend them to anyone who wants to tone it down some like we did.

4287	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I wasn't expecting this to be a fabulous plane for my first real plane at this price.  I was just looking for something that worked well and that's what I've gotten.  I'd been using some 5 dollar micro plane for a while for some small things and some things it was never meant to handle.  Just figured it was time to step into a real plane to properly handle larger jobs and to see if I really wanted to start going down the rabbit hole of plane ownership.  Keep in mind I did not go through the process many do of trying to make sure the plane was perfectly flat and and what not.  The sole seems to be flat to me.  no major problems with the machining.  I did give the blade a basic sharpening by hand and was making great shavings in no time.  This thing has found a permanent place in my regular tool tote.  I honestly can't believe I went as long as I did without a decent block plane.  I suppose the more I use it the more I will want to make sure it performs as well as it can so I will need to get some proper sharpening items and if i get really motivated I might see how flat the sole is and take care of that if it needs it.  Those seem like good skills to have for when a person steps up to a higher quality plane and they want their investment to perform at it's best.  The Stanley Sweetheart planes are looking nicer each day.
I consulted with someone in the industry who has a great deal of experience with PC (and other) motors and collets.  He had never seen a 7518 with a TIR as high as I had measured.  So, I guess it was either an anomaly or my measurement was off.  He did agree that the TIR I had measured for the PC collets was typical of what he has seen.  I decided to return the 7518 for a replacement.
The sole plate is very stiff steel, 1/16" thick - rolled at the edges for strength, and is attached to the saw in four places - it doesn't flex and works exactly as expected.
Another great design feature is the quick release. Pulling back on the black knurled collar "spits" out the bit with an affirmative click. With some practice, you can get it to spit the bit right into your waiting fingers. No more needing to twist the chuck and readjust with every bit change. This TOTALLY makes me a faster worker. Well done.

The potential of a good saw is either limited or fully realized depending upon the quality its side and out feed support.

The fence is attached with two screws, and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined, parallel surfaces, and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt, it is.  After aligning the fence, the machine works, but out of the factory, it was not even close.

When I received the tool by UPS, the tip of the tool was protruding out of the box and the plastic tip was missing.  I called the repair center and explained how it arrived and they wanted to charge me again for the part and shipping. Again very rude and sarcastic.  I will buy Paslode in the future.

The cabinet is beautiful, well constructed, and works well as a contractor unit.  However, I needed to purchase the "large plate" in order to fit my router, and am now stuck with a plate that with poor clearance to its optional rings.  The rings need to be shimmed every time you change them or your work witl catch on the plate. If I had to do it over, I would have spent the $$ on an Incra table top/fence.

I was concerned that it did not come with a case, so I figured I would just build my own. However, the blade comes in a red heavy duty plastic blade "rack" that has the outer blades and shims on one side and the chippers on the other. The blades are held in place with knobs that screw into the rack. The rack also has a nice comfortable handle for easy carrying. Thanks Frued! This rack makes a case unnecessary.
The final installed guard is solid.  I don't plan to relocate my table saw's ON/OFF switch to the supplied switch bracket but I installed the bracket anyway.  I have found that it's the perfect spot to attach one of those magnetic base task lights.  Delta sells a light made just for the uniguard but the mounting holes for it are out on the detachable part of the uniguard.  This would put it closer to the blade for brighter light but would also require you to deal with the electrical cord when you remove the guard for raised panel cuts.

Third--plane in the right direction. Most woods, particularly hardwoods, have a certain slope to their grain. Feel the wood, with the grain, from one side to the other. Your hand will probably slide over it more easily in one direction than the other. The direction that your hand slides over smoothest is the direction that you should be feeding your board into the planer. It will give you a smoother board and save your blades some wear.

The base has holes for four 1/4" attachment bolts.  I drilled mine out to fit the 5/16" bolts I had on hand and didn't run into any problems.  The clamps will exert a lot of force which can be increased or decreased by raising and lowering the rubber foot.

The 9403, 4x24 sander is powerful, has good balance, good belt tracking and easy belt change.  This Makita also picks up a very decent amount of sanding dust, has comfortable handles, a nice soft-start, and, most importantly, chews through stock with ease. This belt sander is possibly the best 4x24 on the market. I am very, very pleased with it.

3756	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Following some of the other review suggestions, I bought the set and installed one plate on my table saw and one on my radial arm saw.  Between adding a link belt and the stabilizer to my table saw, I now have virtually no vibration in the table saw.  With the radial arm saw being direct drive there was less noticeable difference for vibration, but the saw cut is beautiful.  I especially like the 3.5" size of these plates in that they take away very little cutting depth from my 10" saws.  I would recommend them as a simple and inexpensive way to upgrade the quality of your saws.
2051	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am an amatuer woodworker.  I bought the 7518 to put in my Bench Dog router table about 5 years ago.  I did lots of homework on routers and a majority rated this router high on the list for router table use.  I found that it has plenty of power to spare and will handle any bit that will fit in a 1/2 inch collet.  It has five speed settings (10,000 to 21,000 rpm) which handle all of the cutting I have ever had to do.  The on off switch is a rocker panel style (but I run my 7518 through a "Rousseau" switch that is mounted outside my router table).  You do not want to be reaching inside a router table to turn off the power quickly.  (The Rousseau is a better switch than the Bench Dog or any other method because it has a "crash bar" over the stop button that is near impossible to miss with hand or knee or anything else you might use.)  If there is a drawback to using the 7518 in combonation with a router table, it is the inability of being able to raise the moter up to change bits as some of the newer plunge routers are able to do.  (I solved this problem by purchasing the Benchdog Promax Router Lift from Amazon.  Addmittedly, I could have continued using the router plate insert and just keep taking the router motor in and out by lifting if out of the table, but the Promax solved several other issues as well, thus justifying the money spent).

4984	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great drill for making holes in tight spaces.  I have gotton by over the years with a 3/8 inch electric drill and spade bits/hole saws to make all of my holes, but I dislike the spade bits because they take forever and quickly wear out, while hole saws often bottom out when cutting anything thicker than 2 by lumber.  But this drill, combined with Milwaukee's and Dewalt's resharpenable self-feed bits, makes drilling holes almost effortless and I can now reach spots that I could not have before.  The lower RPMs combined with the extra long side handle keep this high torque drill under control when drilling large diameter holes.  I purchased a reconditioned unit for the equivalent of about 3 weeks of fees at the local rental center and it looked brand new.  I have had good luck buying reconditioned gear and I tend to trust this stuff because I believe that they have been carefully examined and all the defects removed.  There's no doubt that this is a specialized tool, but if you have a lot of plumbing and/or electrical work to do than it may be worth getting.  It will save you a lot of time, grief, and sweat in the long run.

There's a lot of positive talk about the new Xtra Clean T308B blades out there. I'll be reviewing them when my first set comes in. It's hard to find customer reviews though. People tend to stick to what they know, I suspect.
My two gripes are the small adjustment knobs on the fence and the power trigger. As a middle aged man with the beginning stages of arthritis, I find the knobs can be difficult to loosen, a little bigger or an oblong rubberized knob would be nice. My other issue is the lack of a thumb safety on the trigger. It's easy to actuate the saw just by picking it up if you aren't paying attention. I get used to it myself but others who may be using the saw on a big project with me have commented on it. If you are a lone woodworker that becomes familiar with it, I imaging you might view the lack of a thumb safety as a good thing, one less annoyance. For me, the lack of one is not a good thing for the general population.

3099	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After seeing some of the reviews on this Dewalt DW911 radio and the reception issue I was a little worried it wouldn't work in my rural area. I found it pulls in FM radio stations from 25 miles away and I have it inside a metal building most of the time and is better reception than I expected. Both AM and FM reception seems to be on par with every other radio in our area. Everybody in our shop has their own radio and listens to their own different station. My Dewalt 911 is now the envy of the shop and I can hear my radio above the other radios and all the other noise in the shop. I like the large speakers and although the bass may not be as great as a home system it sound is great and carries a long way which is what the radio was designed for. No problem with not having a CD either as I just plug in a CD to auxillary port if I want one. Maybe it is a little spendy for work radio but it helps pass the time at work and works great for me.

9464	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this because I thought I could use it in construction for those places where a circular saw or reciprocating saw couldn't get, but I found this so powerful and it eats through wood so fast that it's hard to control precisely. I haven't really found a good use for it in the construction of my home and was worried if anyone else tried to use it because it's a beast. It will eat through plastic, PVC, and wood like nobody's business.
That's my serious face.
The balance, vibration, and longevity of this machine is far superior

Once you have installed the unit on your saw, you are able to remove it and re-install it as necessary pretty quickly. However, it does take some time and you should "group" your cuts to reduce the number of "changeovers" you need to make.

6217	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had some Rigid blades. Those were garbage and would bend or get stuck or dull too quickly. I paid the higher price and went back to Milwaukee. These blades cut through nails and 2x4 like they were not even there at least with my Milwaukee electric saw and last about 3x as long as the rigid blades. On drill bits, saw blades, nails, screws and  tools, made  in the USA is still the best. It is worth extra money to say nothing of how much safer the blade is than the Rigid blades. Nothing more unsafe than a dull blade or one that wears out quickly. Amazon gave me a great price and shipping deal. So thanks.

I was deciding between this one and the Kreg. This one has a smaller footprint and is made out of nice-looking wood. The Kreg doesn't have the enclosed cabinet, so it is not going to reverberate like this one does, and it includes at least one featherboard. (but costs $10-20 more)

  If you are planning on doing the mile deep gloss level of polishing, you will need the 2400 speed range that this Makita gives you. (As well as the other speeds) The polishers that only go to 1750 is not what you want for truly incredible gloss. Especially when using high build finishes like urethanes, and well cured lacquers.

- When I was researching this saw, I read several complaints about the sliding arm bearings "shifting" or being a shaky (which would result in inconsisent cuts, of course).  These people obviously do not read manuals.  Just adjust the bearings using the tool in the back of the arm.  It takes maybe 30 seconds to do a very thorough job of getting the sliding arm very tight (tolerance) and exact.

1603	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I read the reviews before I ordered. I couldn't understand how it could be so cheap. Well I do now. No one actually says why iy is cheap. It is the material it is made of is like a cheap flimsy and it bends easily. BUT If you hang it up plug it and leave it alone it is five stars all the way. It looks good hanging there and is certainly worth the money it is being sold for now. No its not a high dollar neon sign but it is official licensed and looks just like the bates motel sign. Also note the bulb behind the vacancy part of the sign is a twinkle kind of bulb so the vancancy word looks to be shorted out again just as the real psycho bates motel sign looks in the movies. I think I got my moneys worth.

2530	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have been using the scroll saw daily since I received it about a month ago.  Even though it's a "Type 2", it seems to be working just fine.  I had to tip the table a degree or so to get it to be perpendicular to the blade.  No big deal, I just changed the angle indicator to 0 degrees once the blade was perpendicular to the table.  I thought the price at $455 with free shipping was the best deal around until I found the saw plus table and light for $50 more somewhere else.  Oh well, I'm pretty sure that's one of Murphy's laws.

5182	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Porter Cable has a design flaw with the trigger locking switch.  To use this in a router table, your must lock the trigger on and use a switch located on top of the router to turn it on.  The problem is the switch lock breaks easily and the router will not function properly.  I found this out the first time I used it in my table and sent it away to be fixed.  After the fix, the repair lasted 20 minutes.  I am now looking for another router to use in my table.  I will only use the 7529 for hand held applications where I constantly hold down the trigger myself.  Porter Cable should have a recall on this. I am not the only person with this problem.  I posted my problem on a tool chat room and other woodworkers shared the same story.  If you want to use this router for a router table, get another router.  Save yourself the trouble.

That tape has amazing sticking power, and is much better than regular duct tape.

I gave this unit four stars but if they had included the missing features (so easy) I would gladly give it 10 stars... I hope someone at Bosch is reading this.  Maybe they could add this feature in and before it is released allow me to test and review it; of course I wouldn't give it back...

6658	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this chop saw having been a longtime customer of Milwaukee tools.  The saw works well, but does not have the "fit and finish" that most loyal Milwaukee customers have come to expect.  Careful inspection of the tool shows a "Made in Taiwan" label, which explains the relatively "cheap" appearance.  The saw looks like a red off brand in construction with a cheap "Milwaukee" logo sticker on the blade guard...the name is not fabricated into the case like on most large Milwaukee tools.  That being said, the saw has worked OK for me thus far, I have cut rod steel and angle iron of various sizes without any trouble, but the saw is only about 4 months old....we'll see how it does in the long term.

I used it with a magnifying glass for coin collecting.  I used it when cleaning the dog's ears. He'd lay on his side on the couch, and I'd clip the light to the edge of the afghan and direct it so I could see. (A couple years ago, my wife gave me a head lamp that works even better.) More recently, I clip it to the toilet seat to illuminate the target during those nocturnal visits, improving aim without blinding me with bathroom lights.

To be fair, when it runs- it feels fine.  Balance is fair.  It tracks well and the dust collector works reasonably well. (By the way, Amazon had this shipped WITHOUT the bag!  I had to sort-of make a big deal about it because it IS advertised as having the bag).  Gotta be careful!

  The factory inserts have the advantage of working with all different size blade thicknesses. They also work if you are tilting the blade, to a 45 degree angle for example. These zero clearance inserts do not do that. You have to buy a new one for every type of blade and angle. (Unless you are willing to defeat the zero clearance advantage.)
7579	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent tool to have on the job.  It is perfect when adding nailers for drywall when all you have is the bad left over studs.  Also good for straightening studs that have moved or twisted since you framed up the project, not a tool you use a ton but needed when it comes right down to it, very handy!
7999	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Very poorly constructed.  Flimsy sheet metal.  Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame.  Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part.  Reasonably sturdy with all 4 legs on a flat floor, but I suspect it will prove wobbly on an uneven surface.  Definitely not for the serious DIYer who works with heavier items.  Next time I would look for something much sturdier.  Made in China.

The Bessey corner clamps are real a fantastic way to align and clamp the corners.  A second clamp to apply the pressure to the joint and it is done.  There were a few casting burrs on my clamps that needed a file to smooth, but none on the clamping surfaces.  Glue peels off the clamp easily.  I bought two and together they will be adequate.  Four clamps would make production a tad faster but certainly a pair is the way to go.  Missing a decent hook or suck to make storage any thing but tossing in a drawer.  Classic Bessey quality.  I've never been disapointed with Bessey and it is why the red clamps are my default brand.

I have used many dozens of different hammers over the years for everything from roofing to framing to finish work, and this Estwing is still one of the best hammers ever made and I love it and would never ever part with it.  It is beautiful, functional, and of the highest quality.  Forget all the fancy new fangled MIG welded, titanium, fiberglass, death-on-a-stick, carbon fiber, replaceable face hammers out there.  This is the one you want.  Once you have this one, go ahead and flirt with others--you will always come back.
173	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Wow this is bright, and has multiple uses! I started reading at night to help me get sleepy for bed. I couldn't keep using my bedside lamp because it put out to much light and would keep my wife up. The fix was to buy a decent book light and this is more than decent. It is bright, consumes very little power, and has uses outside of reading books. The obvious use is for reading but if you are a handyman type, any time you are working on electrical wiring, it can be clipped to the edge of an outlet box, hole in the drywall, to your shirt, etc. This has come in handy more than once. Highly Recommend!
901	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great price on these.  The jury is out on how long they will last compared to the more expensive bulbs I have purchased in the past. Will update this review if they turn out not to be the best replacement option.

9330	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	There are two things that I wish DeWalt had improved upon. First, the stop  collars are fixed to the counter bore cutters.  I wish the stop collars  could move separately from the counter bore cutters, as such a counter bore  could be more than about 1/2" deep.  I've not actually tried to  countersince with this, though I have not reason to believe that they  wouldn't work great.  I am using the drill bits for some pilot holes  through 2x4s, and I did notice the bits struggle a bit.  They work but they  are not like a hot knife through warm butter.  Time will tell how long the  bits last.
The blades ARE very easy to put in!  Blade changing has always been a pain with other saws so I don't know why this is so easy. I barely tighten the knob (wimpy girl) (no wrench needed) and the blade is in. Maybe there is something inside the blade holder that is different and holds blades in place better than the others without the excessive tightening.
5909	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I got these to use with my Black & Decker PSL12 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Piranha Outdoor Pruning Saw (which I also got on Amazon).  These new models use a clamplike devise to grab the blade.  These work perfectly and they did not cost much.

Too late for me to return them, as I loved the tool so much I bought a bunch of different sawing blades to have on hand and just got around to using these.  The quality is definitely not up to Fein quality and it makes the company look bad.  I cannot recommend these at all, consider them a total waste of $36, and wish I could rate them a zero.

* The hose is lightweight and flexible enough (and long enough) that is was not really a hassle to use. Having a hose hooked up to the sander takes a little getting used to, but after a few minutes I barely noticed it was there. The hose is flexible enough not to knock over everything else on the workbench.
The light works really well with the swivel head feature allowing it to shine where I need it. I also have the light with the flexible head but it's too big and bulky for some applications. This makes a perfect addition to my toolkit.

7278	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Absolute  garbage. I had one of their old workmates and it was fantastic. Times have changed. I don't know where this pile of junk is made (I would guess China) but nothing was as it should have been when putting it together. Everything was misaligned and what should have been a 20 minute assembly turned into a 3 1/2 hour adventure with nothing fitting correctly when it was done. This thing claims it has a "550 capacity" but I wouldn't trust it with 40 pounds. I ended up having to bore out the metal pieces where the plastic brackets fit because of the way it lined up, the front piece lacked room to open up because their was lack of room between the boards from a factory were cut incorrectly. Bottom line, I'll likely end up tossing this pile of crap out into the trash, don't waste your money.

808	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Assuming they live up to the advertised average bulb lifetime, these are a good deal. However, I was replacing two brands of lights, and whereas the two previous brands were close to the same size as each other, these were bigger. So big, in fact, that they do not fit in the puck lights, and barely fit in the outdoor lights. At first I thought, "Well, Mea culpa for not looking at the dimensions in the product details," but those dimensions are of the box(es) not the bulb. These bulbs all say 120V 20W JCD G8, but these a touch longer and fatter than the other brands.

I just bought the drill recently but I feel confident reviewing it now as I can tell this thing won't let me down. Just as stated many times before me, this drill has some power! One thing I did want to comment on however was that I was a little worried about how 'variable' the variable speed was. I have read plenty of reviews where it is commented that this drill is basically an on-off switch, or starts at half rpm and jumps up from there. Not mine! I feel that I have complete control over the speed and trigger and have so far had no issue bringing the rpm's way low when needed. The adjustable side grip adds a nice comfortable grip for added control, and I had forgotten how much I miss a keyed chuck as well. So far this has been a nice and needed addition to the tool box. I'm sure it will quickly become my workhorse for medium to heavy work

I don't know where I got my gene for organizing and taking good care of my tools, but it certainly wasn't from my dad.  That Estwing hammer got left out lying on the lawn in the rain more than once; it was literally used hard and (not) put away wet!  So eventually, long after I had graduated from college, one of the rings in the handle broke apart thus allowing the rest of them a great deal of play and slippage, thus practically ruining the hammer.  I honestly don't remember whether I asked permission, or if I just stole it, but either way, I took that hammer--MY favorite hammer--from my dad.  I carefully cut some sections of thick leather to push into missing section to get rid of the play and fill in the channels of the tang (it's like an I-beam) and then I wrapped waxed linen cord around and around to finish filling in the void and bring the hammer back into working order.  It worked out really well, and the handle was firmer and more secure than ever.

The base seems a bit clunky (large) but I suppose it can't get much smaller and still have room for the batteries. Definitely good for the price! ($9.89) Probably would make a good gift for people. And I can see this being used for travel, though I'm sure some company also makes sleeker and tinier (and more expensive) "travel booklights". (This is already pretty small though!)
2538	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The stand is very sturdy and relatively easy to assemble. FYI it does not readily fit the Delta 40-694 as I thought it would. There needs to be some modification done first. I cant fault the stand or the manufacturer for my mistake. After I made the necessary modifications the saw fit fine. Hope this helps anyone else because this stand is recommended along with the Delta 40-694 and it isn't readily compatible.
472	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this about a year ago and am just now getting around to reviewing it.  Its perfect in every way. The clip is strong, the light is bright and even has two settings, and the bendable extension allows you to position the light at any angle.

3775	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Just received my DW3178 blade from Amazon and see it is now made in China. Looked carefully on the Amazon site and couldn't find where it is made. For me there are too many other choices to buy a chinese blade, no matter how it cuts. Also wish Amazon more clearly showed country of origin.
But who knows how yours will come. I hear the switch is pretty weak and fails a lot. I don't know. I may not know because I use a foot switch.

If you have a nearby Harbor Freight they have surprising consistent spring clamps for cheap. They look like the other cheapies, but with better quality control (ironic to say that about a product from HF). Other than that option, I'm sold on these clamps.
7420	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A little more expensive that the the normal screws from Home Depot, but better quality. For some reason they even seem to grip better. They are the screws that come with the Kreg fastening system ( a must for anyone doing woodwork) and are a first class product that works well for the system as well as general use.
the nuts supplied with my base did not thread properly on the levelling feet, but a second trip to home depot took care of that problem - strange thing is that the nuts are also 5/16 just like the ones originally included!
3534	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I recently purchased this sander and must say it is the most aggressive sander I have ever seen.  It puts my pneumatic sanders to shame in sanding. I will say that it is kind of heavy and awkward to hold.  After sanding two  hours with it my right hand was quite sore and tired.  Other than that, it  is an excellent tool.
  This is a very good saw blade.  I've never had a saw blade that cuts rips of 3/4 plywood so thin you can see light through the pores of the end grain.  This one does it without shattering the cut off.
I'll also mention that the blade choices for these are a bit limited so make sure you look into that at the same time you look at this saw.
Packing and shipping was good too.
This is a very good saw, but remember to play with your tools before you buy them. And think of the end user if it is a gift.

Once I got it together, the surface is not level, the boards do not align properly. The handle part where you bolt on the last board were not even so I had to take that all apart and due to the tension on the bolts, it was a serious pain in the butt. To top it all off, when I raised the front bench to make it 90 degrees the first time, the whole orange handle mechanism completely fell off and I can't figure out to get it back together so anytime I want to use the handles the whole thing lifts up instead of being locked in position.

The item was shipped immediately and I received it within 3 days. It truly is just a large piece of molded plastic/composite that is designed to fit 20" diameter trash cans. Even though I had 3 different style trash cans laying out behind my house, I fully expected to have to go purchase a trash can to fit this unit, based on a lot of the other reviews.

There is a reason a Veritas is 4x the cost - tighter process controls, thicker A2 blade, some design improvements.

However, one does have a tool that works very well for low cost + time to tune it.

The recip action really works nice when cutting through 6x6, wet,pressure treated fir. I tried both ways and it really made things quick.

I misplaced my previous Vix bit and mounted a piano hinge on a box using the old mark, center punch, and then drill routine - time consuming and tedious process.  Used the Vix on a second project to mount a piano hinge and took less than one third the time, and the hole placement was also more precise. Excellent value for the money.

The speed adjustment is easy to use and the saw responds well and keeps a smooth action through its whole speed range. The on/off switch is big and easy to use right on top. One saw I tried it was down under the table another had it half way back on the side of the arm.
4129	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It fits perfectly and makes cutting easier. It really should come standard with the saw, but I didn't mind buying it separately.
9241	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The battery works great and holds a charge for a good amount of time but... it doesn't fit snuglyl in the charger which I find irritating.  It wobbles a bit and you have to be sure the contacts are touching then make sure it's somewhere where it won't get bumped.  Other than that, it's fine.  You should know that the Paslode Framing nail gun I am using is an older model purchased around 2005.  My guess is that it will fit fine in the newer chargers, but I haven't checked that out.
3278	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They are awesome on my 716XPS, they hold the crown at the exact angle so you don't get any miss cuts. I'm not sure how what the max size crown is that they'll fit but they work good.

Unusually long extension cord which I like as it minimizes need for an extension cord and when an extension cord is needed it keeps the connection out of the way.
2469	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This router is OK, but I thought I was buying something "Made in USA".  To my surprise, the package said "Made in Mexico".  I would have bought a different one had I known.
5005	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It's a great tool on a framing jobsite. It makes cutting 3X(1 cut)  and 6X(2 cuts) very easy.  The depth adjustment is a big plus as well.  You can easily adjust for special notches and material thicknesses.  The two drawbacks so far have been the lack of a ladder hook and the blade guard.  The guard is shaped in such a way that it can sometimes get stuck on the material being cut.  Overall I like picking up this saw to cut 6X material over the much heavier BigFoot.
It's not totally plug and play, but for the price is great. If you have a shop vac you probably have the skills to get it together.

It arrived a day earlier than expected (good job, Amazon!), and the packaging was nice.  That's about all I can say that's positive about this plane.
I think the other reviewer may have had one of the first 788 lemons that I have heard about.
Overall I'm very glad I bought this tool.
  Pro or amateur[those that simply do something for the love of it, none-the-lesser], many woodworkers take pride in their work; precision is a good part of this sense.  Here again,  "Board Buddies" helps achieve that level of precision by gently keeping the board against the fence and tracking true.  They do this with ease, without complication, and RELIABLY, often exceeding a shifty feather board.
stationary pad is loose and will not tighten fully, will not tighten enough and after only a few simple use's began to slip. I contacted Irwin and they promptly sent me a replacement without requiring me to return the old 1 (just had to send a picture prior to replacement) new 1 is only slightly better. I have the larger models and they are great.
1610	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say about this self releasing collet with locking nut: it locked the router bit down properly when tightened and released the bit with loosened. This is a nice feature as I didn't need to tap the side of the router shaft before the collet came loose.
2) The saw doesn't vibrate hardly at all in fact I don't even have mine mounted yet. I have simply put it on a work bench and the saw stays put.

Im 300 lbs and i use it to install garage doors lifting 100+lb panels into the top section position - legs always stay locked and i never even hesitate to go up it blind - had it several months now and use it all day every day - hope they never stop making it - if they made a 3 ft one i would be in heaven i could install 8 ft tall doors with it and get rid of my other ladder taller completely and save alot of room in my truck

This is their overall reviews:
However, the handle is slippery as hell if you're wearing gloves.  I have the Mechanix gloves with leather palms and once I have accidentally thrown this hammer across the room after some tiring demo work.  Without gloves it is no problem to grip the handle, and it very well may be that once I break it in some more the handle gets more grippy - but for now just be warned that this is one slippery handle.
The bit can not employ the full bite. However this makes a 2 X 4 pressure treated stick into a very nice hand rail for the outdoor ramp. I rounder all eight sides and sanded smooth. I do not use the OEM base anymore.
2120	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	august 27, 2013.  have used it for a while now. it really works. this particular sander really spreads the dust around.  good dust collector is important
2633	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It's a solid stand but it has minor problems. The instructions are not detailed at all, some of the parts had to be slightly twisted to fit, it does not include securing screws for the scroll saw but comes with extra short screws. The back height is adjustable but they don't tell you which hole to make it level. The stand is very solid once put together though
Step forward, backward, or straddle, this is a great step ladder.
7452	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Very good, sturdy clamps. I only rated them 4 stars because Rocklers surefoot is a much better design with equal the quality. Use galvanized pipe, same price & it won't rust or stain your work. Also for some homebrewed clamp pads take some scrap 3/4" fir plywood, it's relatively soft & doesn't split, cut it into roughly 2" x 3 1/2" pieces. Then drill a 1 1/8" hole towards one end & paint it with polyuerathane. Slip it over the pipe & screw it to the clamp faces from behind with #6 x 3/4" sheet metal screws. You'll wind up with decent clamp pads that won't stick to glue or come off of the clamp.
5043	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great snug fit.
1063	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition.  They give off a nice warm blue glow.  I'm using them in the main home theater room and have them connected to a remote dimmer receiver module, which is controlled with a remote X10 type controller.
Surprisingly, this dado set is worth the money for the serious woodworker who no longer wants to struggle with shims trying to get a snug fit, or the unattractive arc a wobble dado produces.
Will work well for a homeowner that will use it occasionally.
 Not to be slamming the Bench Dog, but, the Bench Dog 10-010 Crown Cutter lays loose on the table,,,and you lose 5/8 - 3/4 inch of cutting capacity both in hight and width. These stops from dewalt fasten tight to the table and you lose nothing in cutting capacity. You need all of the cutting capacity you can get when cutting wide crown molding!! Maybe I'm just so used to the small stops that I'm resisting change. But having a loose jig on a precise cutting tool would surely lead to cumulative error,, wouldn't it??? A loose piece of crown on a loose jig? Granted, you can have the Bench Dog attached to your saw, but doesn't that defeat the option of cutting on either side of the blade? And what about safety when its not fastened down?
9631	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent design, materials and construction. I bought two. These are the best accessory for your cordless driver, hands down. Saves valuable time.
3597	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It is remarkable how cheaply made, but dearly priced DeWalt tool accessories are. This is another example. Just a bunch of fittings and a couple of stamped steel guides. They even managed to screw up the DeWalt label stuck to the face of the guides. One was wrinkled and would have prevented reliable operation. Had to pull it off and clean off the adhesive residue wih solvent.

 With the flawless results I got with the Freud, I am wondering why I paid three times the price for the Forrest. The Forrest Woodworker II is designed for Table Saws. The Freud is advertised on the package as being ideal for Table Saws, Radial Arm saws, and Miter and or Compound Miter Saws. I am keeping the Forrest for the table saw, I have spoken to Forrest owners who love their blade, even a year after using it. They love not having to change the blade for different kinds of cuts, and state it is still sharp after a year. I'm expecting the same kind of results from the Freud. Both of these blades have 5/8" arbors, and are a 1/8" thin kerf. The Forrest has a thinner 3/32" model as well, but some of the reviews indicate some inaccuracy on that model.
4446	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this fence system & love it.  It installed very easily in about 30 minutes.  I took care to get it leveled up well & to have the fence sit about 1/64" above the saw table so it doesn't chatter when I move it.  This fence is vey much like my table saw Biesmeyer fence, just smaller.  Much better than the melamine covered particle board table & fence system I had purchased.

1854	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I really like this edge guide a lot.  The only trouble is that the screws that mount it to the router don't come with either the router or the guide, and it's not a size that most people have in their shop.  It seems to be a metric M5.  I had to go chasing around to find the right screws.
6259	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The only blade to get for cutting limbs.  Heavy duty, gets the job done.  Will definitely order more.
9325	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This hose has some weight to it so it lays flat & seldom kinks.  I just drag this thing around on the ground to wherever it's needed without having to worry if it's getting hung up on something.  And if it does, I give it a snap to free it.  I wouldn't say that I abuse this hose but I'm not nice to it either.  I'm so glad that I bought this.

6900	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a light weight pipe wrench with excellent bite. It is easy to use and handle. I bought another one.

5663	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I can not stress enough how much I love this table!!!!!!  Initially, I'd bought a different (cheaper) table.  It was plastic and whatnot, but low and behold it got STOLEN!  I know, right?!  I hope that guy's lying in a ditch somewhere.  Anyways, joke's on him because that table was a piece of crap compared to THIS one!  It doesn't take long to put together, but once it's done you've got a very NICE table!  It fits all kinds of routers!  I use Dewalts in mine.  Completely adjustable and even has a hole in the back for your power cord!
8572	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Its an Estwing hammer, what else is there to say.  I've owned dozens of hammers over the years, and these are simply my favorite for most jobs, especially framing work.  I love the handles, the heads, and the balance.  You simply can't go wrong with Estwing.
For me, the large diameter hole in the table to allow use with raised panel bits is the main reason I bought the PC table. I normally have my 2-1/4 HP Makita RF1101 fixed base router permanently installed in it and it seems adequate with most things I use it for. I haven't had any issues with burrs in the table top casting that others have mentioned or with the insert rings popping up during use, even without the fence installed.

  - Much easier to empty (especially with the wheeled dolly) than the usual fight with the dust collector bag.
6210	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I give it a star for price as I purchased on sale at a local Woodcraft store for $16. However, I will be returning it. Woodcraft's website says this fits 2-1/2" shop vac hoses. Wrong. A standard 2-1/2" vacuum hose is too small to fit over the connector and too large to fit inside it. In fact, they are similar diameters. ONly the fact that the cyclone's connectors are a thicker plastic than the vacuum hose, make them somewhat different diameters both inside and out. I do not want to take time to force fit or search out adapters to make the connections work. It is also true the lid fits loosely on 5-gallon buckets and you would also need to rig a way to strengthen the fit so dust did not escape and so the lid did not fall off when hoses are moved or the bucket bumped. A total dud in my opinion.
4929	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this from Amazon in April of 2007.  In those (almost) 4 years, I have formed some strong opinions.  Please allow me to share them with you.

The table has two angle braces that bolt at the lower end to the bottom of the saw cabinet, and bolt at the top end to two horizontal supports that extend from the top of the saw cabinet.  For some reason, the two bolts that are used to attach the bottom of the braces are radically different from one another even though both bolts perform the same function.  There is no mention of the reason for this in the assembly instructions.  These bolts are inserted from the outside the saw cabinet and the nuts are connected from inside the saw cabinet.  In order to connect the nuts to the bolts you have to remove the injection molded plastic motor cover.  It is almost impossible to connect the nut to the bolt for the angled support brace that is the furthest away from the saw motor cover.  The distance you have to reach into the saw base to attach this nut is much longer than my arm.  I couldn't hold the support brace with one hand and at the same time wrap my arm around the cabinet and stick my arm in the motor cover hole to attach the nut.  This is definitely a two person job, and one person has to have very long arms.

8968	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A DYIer so maybe I hoped for more, but boy does this hose get wrapped around itself easily!  That said, it got me through my job putting up 23 squares of shingles, with just a nick or two.

You'll need an hour to get it ready to work.

Go ahead and give it a try.
4071	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I give the blade set 5 stars, but I was extremely disappointed with the Freud packaging.  It's cheap.  It falls way below the quality I've come to expect from Freud.  When I opened the case, the blades had been jostled around during shipping and the blades were no longer fixed into position.  The teeth of some of the blades where in contact with each other.  I checked for any nicks on the blade teeth, but fortunately found none.
As delivered it was good.  I cleaned it thoroughly and everything was at least of the quality you'd expect at this price.
8012	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This works if you need a flat chisel point but not overly wide.

586	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Highly recommend!  Ignore the (1) replies; switch works fine.  If a concern, take the batteries out when you travel, or don't toss in a backpack with a lot of other objects, or tape it; use common sense.  The light beam covers each page well; paperback, hardcover, or Kindle2, attach it to the top or bottom spine or front or back cover, or back of leather Kindle cover; firm grip.  Best light I own, EXCEPT for the one light/one battery Flex Travel, which is my fave.  I feel a person would have to be extreeemly picky not to be able to use and enjoy either of these lights, and they (all colors of XtraFlex2, not just black) work well with a Kindle in a cover.  Clip it to the back cover, not the kindle itself, plenty of room.  Long life and clear light at the right shade, good coverage. Takes very basic knowledge to figure these out.  Very forgiving, unless you drop and step on it. Don't look directly at the light, but its OK to turn into the eyes of a person reading over your shoulder with bad breath. Get a Kindle2, at least.
6119	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	An excellent, low cost, solution to your dust seperation issues.  Prior to purchasing this 2-stage cyclone seperator I could only vacuum fine dust and debris from my wood shop.  Larger bits of debris would forcefully get sucked into the fan blades of the DC blower and bang around before shooting out of the back side into the dust bag.  I feared that my DC blower would get damaged from this so I sought out to purchase or build a seperator.  I have a small shop, approximately 13' x 10', and a standard 50 Gallon seperator, although idea, would be too large for my space.  This seperator fits onto a 5-Gallon hardware store bucket, which I already owned several of.  It takes up only 1 sq ft of floor space and I can easily suspend it, tuck it away or move it with out any issues.  The only concerns I have are that the lid does not "snap-on" to the bucket and does not have a tight fit.  I fixed this by running a couple of layers of plastic/vinyl tape (any wide, flexible tape would work, i.e. duct tape) around the rim of the bucket, now the lid fits securely.  The 5-gallon bucket handle fits tightly over the seperator to help hold it in place.  Additionally once the DC is running the Suction pulls the seperator tight against the bucket too.  Lastly the 2 1/2" ports don't securly hold in place the hoses, i had to add tape to the end of my hose connectors in order to create a tight friction fit into the ports.
4089	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use these in my Craftsman multi-tool, and they are great.  It is amazing what they will go through and how quickly.  Just remember that it is a WOOD blade and NOT a bi-metal blade or one for wood with embedded nails.

I have used 1/4 sheet pad sanders by Makita, Dewalt and Black & Decker. I can't understand why anyone would want one, they are noisy, uncomfortable and vibrate.

My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist. I did like the heft of the machine. It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.) I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective. All in all, not very good.

When the assembly of the out feed table is complete, it's clear that you will never want to disassemble it even if the saw needs to packed up for moving across the Atlantic.  The pain of re-assembly would be just too strong of a deterrent.
548	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am very pleased with this product. There is more than adequate brightness whereby I can read a book or magazine in a pitch black room. You can either use 1 LED (low position) or 2 LED's (high position). Both will give you more than enough light. Buy with confidence.
The modifications are relatively simple.  Viewing the saw from the outfeed looking towards the saw's back, there is a space between the 4" dust connection and the conduit box where you can install the right vertical support.  By  placing the holes for the left supports an inch or two off the left edge, all the slotted brackets line up pretty good.  I am not going into detail on the dimensions because you'd need a drawing to give you every detail.  You may need to do a partial assembly to estimate the location before drilling the holes.  Just know it can be done if you use the Delta instructions and  a little ingenuity.

4278	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	OK, it's my first biscuit joiner, I'll admit, but I have only nice things to say about it. It received an excelent rating in the Taunton Press tool guide and was one of the mid priced models, so I took the plunge (so to speak) and it has definately proved itself . I've used this tool for quite a few projects and it has worked smoothly and flawlessley. joints come out tight and perfectly aligned. There is only one drawback that comes to mind. It seems to be an excepted fact that the dust collector, as with most biscuit joiners, is not worth using. If you use the dust bag it will plug instantly. As someone else here recommended, I just turn the discharge nozzle away from me or to the floor and sweep up the chips later. I did connect it to my home central vac system with a rigged up adapter once and that seemed to work well but isn't always so convenient for me.
If you've never owned a toolbag before and are considering trying one out to cut down on weight and the awkwardness and impracticality of carrying around large rigid tooboxes, I strongly recommend giving the Gatemouth series a try.  In case you haven't read it elsewhere, here's a few of their features:  Very durable rip-stop nylon-like construction, with over-reinforced seams.  Material construction makes the bag itself practically weighless, and able to fold flat when empty, and even when full able to conform to many different constricting shapes when forced into a small area that rigid toolboxes cannot, plus that makes it able to accommodate large and odd sized tools.  Super reinforced bottom and lower-sides to handle the rough-tough usage that a toolbox suffers.  Oversized, reinforced zipper (you'll break before this zipper does).  A massive compliment of pockets, both inside and out.  And the "Gatemouth" opening, which opens to the same size as the rest of the toolbag (guaranteeing that if the tool can fit in the bag, it will fit through the opening).  (And just in case I haven't said "reinforced" enough:)  Reinforced nylon handles that can carry pretty much anything you can fit in the bag.  Seriously, this is a quality product and it's at a steal of a price.
Lenox blades are the  toughest, best made blades for recip saws.  The brief history is that they  were designed for plumbers to cut through pipe and were once only available  through plumbing suppliers.  Not anymore.  The secret is out and you can  even get them from Amazon!  At the end of the day these blades have more  teeth left than the crowd at a barroom brawl!  You can "kill"  one, but it takes alot more effort.

4878	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Essentially, BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable, because they look similar, except for the color,  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable, anytime anyone has used mine, they get them too !
5545	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This thing is a toy.  It took FOREVER to put together because the manual is so bad. The bridge is a joke, tightening it so that you can use it means that you're slowly tearing up the particle-board top.

I know... some people will tell me that is dangerous. I disagree. The board buddy rollers hold material down and perfectly stationary. Assuming they are adjusted adequately, the board will NOT budge. I've been working with large wide boards and long thin boards like this for decades using much weaker hold downs and never had a problem. But do not let me convince you otherwise if YOU think that is a dangerous practice. If a method does not seem safe to YOU, the YOU should not try it.

Sonin's readings were the same 8% even though there was a 10% difference in the readings from Surveymaster. 8%-12% would be considered ok for wood, but 18% is not.

  (...)  Put the first project together using this system, then I came to the glue up, and the cheap clamps did not do the job. All that perfection, so easily, and while under the gun of set up time, the clamps failed me, and I have a less than perfect edge. The dry fitted pieces fitted perfectly. Now I have to go back with a sander, and true up the pieces. That is what drove me to buy a bunch of these Bessey clamps. Smooth, easy mechanicals, great surface area that is flat, and if you get the knack of clamping them at the right pressure, they create a flat platform on the base of your project. All in all definitely 5 stars, I know I will be adding more to the collection. Highly recommended. Bite the bullet, and start or add onto your collection. They are worth it.

Personally, I've not found anything any better than these crown stops (in thier proper application). As far as I know, there are no other crown stops that fit this saw. As far as accuracy,,,after determining the distance from the wall to the top face of the crown, I rip a scrap (1x whatever)  exactly that wide. If it's 18 inches to 24 inches long it will lay all the way across the saw and I can set both crown stops against the scrap and tighten them down. I've never had one to come loose or bend. Most crown is fairly light and using the upside down method of miter cuts demands the accuracy afforded by some kind of stops or a jig like the Bench Dog.

It's incredibly smooth and feels great in my hand. It's very powerful and can shape wood beautifully. The foam backing pad is really thick and plush so it can handle corners and edges without squaring them.

I also like the plastic holder.  Someone had written a review complaining about it.  It holds the blades securely, and separate from the chippers.  The holder has a handle, and provides for storing the case either vertical or horizontal.  I don't find it to be flimsy.

Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any. I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud. I have many others in the past. I would put the Hitachi up with the best! No vibration! Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant. It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely. Why do people spend all that money on accessories to "raise and lower " the router in a table??? A waste of money. It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great. Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models. The soft start is nice. The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you) The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 ! Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer. I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect! I think I'll go rout something...

7807	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I was a kid growing up, I would often help my dad with various projects around the house.  Especially at first this mostly involved me standing around a lot and running and getting him tools and supplies when asked, and one of my earliest memories of fetching a tool for my dad was getting him a hammer.  I went down into the basement and grabbed the nicest looking hammer and came running back with it.  "Oh, no, sorry, but I wanted your grandfather's hammer--the one with the brown leather handle," he said.  "Could you please run and get that for me instead?"  I was perplexed.  I knew the hammer he was talking about, and it was a rusty, beat up looking thing with a weird handle!  Why did my dad want THAT hammer?  Just because it had been his dad's maybe?  I didn't know, but, I ran down and got him that hammer instead.  I soon learned that when my dad wanted a "hammer" he wanted THAT hammer--evidently his favorite hammer.
Almost all circular saws have a design flaw in common, which is that they are factory-set for blade-to-shoe alignment. This manufacturing short-cut makes saws easier & cheaper to mass-produce, but it means the user must sacrifice accuracy, especially when using a saw-guide or straight-edge. Most DO NOT have any way to conveniently adjust blade-to-shoe parallelism.

It glides nicely over the wood and does not leave any gouge marks as some of the 3x21 sanders do.  Nothing like a big 4 inch sander for professional looking jobs.  I can't say enough about this Makita sander.  Any professional work workers would totally understand.

Also, the instructions suggest cutting 12 inches off both the top and the bottom of the main "J" shaped steel tube if your fence is less than 52 inches (mine is).  Based on suggestions I read here on Amazon reviews I waited to cut mine and I'm glad.  In the end, I cut just 9 inches off mine for a perfect fit.

2290	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Expensive? Yeah. but NOT as costly as cutting off a thumb or a kicked back 2 X 4. This is designed to support whatever you're cutting, so you can SAFELY keep material under control. It is well made (albeit in Taiwan) with heavy- duty parts -  rods, plates and hardware. Mine came with STANDARD 1/2" SAE nuts. Try using adjustable wrenches to install the rods to the plate and the screws underneath.  Also if you leave just a little looseness in  the installation hardware under your saw, you can easily slide the extension in and out to accomodate your lumber. You may want to lightly lubricate the rods. If I had a complaint, it would be that this should come WITH your DeWalt miter saw instead of as an extra.
The point has been made that what the DD costs will buy a lot of bits. That may be true if you buy cheap bits, but would you buy a new bit for every project? And what about your time to go to the store to pick the darn things up?
My complaint is the dust collection bag.  Almost seems like a 3rd party manufacturer for just the bag.  Main issue with it is the zipper.  Right out of the box, the little pull tab on the slider body part was missing.  I use a pliers to open the zipper and then it's still hard to do.  The zipper has very little "clearance" between the teeth and the slider body so it gets gummed up pretty easily with sawdust (which it should be designed to deal with).

As the name implies, it dampens blade-vibration. All saw blades have slight imbalances that produce vibration at high speeds. Anything that reduces that vibration, improves how well your saw cuts.
Keep in mind that like most people who would buy this product, I'm not shy about putting things together.  In addition to woodworking, I do machining and metalwork, welding, carpentry, and a lot of electronics fabrication too.  But it really makes me mad to have someone steal my time to increase their profit margins.

Conclusion...dont waste your money on these!
  I bought the Incra TSIII-32 table saw fence, installed it on my 10" old, circa 1950's cast iron table saw, and was amazed at getting instant accuracy to .002". A whole new world opened up to me, and I was amazed at how easy it was to automatically measure and cut without any slight off angles binding the wood. Put the first project together using this system, then I came to the glue up, and the cheap clamps did not do the job. All that perfection, so easily, and while under the gun of set up time, the clamps failed me, and I have a less than perfect edge. The dry fitted pieces fitted perfectly. Now I have to go back with a sander, and true up the pieces. That is what drove me to buy a bunch of these Bessey clamps. Smooth, easy mechanicals, great surface area that is flat, and if you get the knack of clamping them at the right pressure, they create a flat platform on the base of your project. All in all definitely 5 stars, I know I will be adding more to the collection. Highly recommended. Bite the bullet, and start or add onto your collection. They are worth it.

6357	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As a homeowner and avid do-it-yourselfer I found these the be well constructed, strong and easy to use. I have only one suggestion. The pilot holes feature a guide to start the hole before using the larger countersink bit. This guide has a small ball-bearing detent to center it but it doesn't quite center it. You have to take a little extra care to make sure it is centered. I marked the clamp and guide to make sure it was centered each time before I used the starter bit. Additionally the countersink bit would not fit entirely into the hole, forcing me to move the clamp to finish the hole. I had to leave one clamp In place while I did this to keep the cabinets aligned and move the clamp and check the alignment to finish the countersink. It's not bad but requires care and planning. Still, I like the clamps.

Hellsya! Especially when that speed is doubled.  As with all powered drivers, the inverse rule of higher speed=lower torque ability applies.  Hence, the greatest power differential is between lowest speed+highest torque setting["6" on the somewhat obscured scale]which can easily strip out sheetmetal and wood screws, Vs highest speed+lowest torque setting which can let you just snug that switchplate screw without hearing that soft but very unpleasant and all too familiar "crrraccck".

3588	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great stand, I installed a small table saw on it. The saw is wider then the stand's base but it is stable and does not move or tip at all.  I did have to cut the legs down 6 inches for the saw to be the right height (a grinder made quick work of it).  In all the stand is very well built made from heavy gauge steel parts, carriage bolts,and rubber feet, this stand could hold up my truck!  The only con I see is the top of the stand is only 10" wide.  If i were to mount a drill press, grinder, or band saw i would buy and use this stand again.
3881	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I shopped around and this was the best deal going. I am not a pro and I may only use this 1 or 2 times, but I wanted one that would do a good job and was not a peice of junk. This was perfect. Moderately priced, good quality and got the job done.
So, from my experience, this and the 364 are the best standard side-winder saws for general carpentry. This model is best when you need the extra cutting depth. Aside from cutting-depth, the design features and quality of the 364 and this 384 are identical. And as far as I know, these are the only two production saws now being made that have the base-plate adjustment built-in.
I generally enjoy the saw and have a great deal of confidence in it getting the work done. I would give it a higher review, but it's not a tough tool, just a good one.

1780	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been a woodworker for over 35 years & this is my go-to finishing sander.  Over the years, I have tried a multitude of different sanders from various manufacturers, including the high end ones like festool, & none of them even come close to this sander, IMHO.  Not only does the sander remove wood relatively quickly, but it also provides an excellent finish to my work.  The design makes it extremely comfortable to use & control.  I've often sanded with this for several hours a day & have not had any issues.  The product is also very well made.  It will last a long, long time, even with heavy usage.  However, the pad & perhaps brushes will periodically need to be replaced.  I highly recommend the sander.

I have to say this blade is as good as the good reviews. It cuts very smooth. Make sure you cut your hardwood at a fairly fast pace, and the edges will come out smooth enough that you will not need to sand them.

Never had much wear on the rubber handles, either.  These to not transmit the rebound and shock into my hands.
2651	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality. This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper (my little mouse sander does better job) and as for other features, I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect. But my variable speed option still works though.  After using it on a project for about 20 hours, the bearings went and I had to get it fixed.  Once this sander quits on me, I think I'll opt for the Porter Cable.
I do not like the way the speed control is implemented.  Many years in the electronics field has left me with a real dislike of slide switches.  I think of them as a failure waiting to manifest itself.  And while I admit there may be some benefit to a stepped speed control in my application, I have a preference for continuously variable controls that I can tune to find the "sweet spot" for what I am doing.  As expensive as this unit is, I would like to have seen a solid state control.  If Porter Cable wanted to really address the upside down under a table market, a plug in remote speed control with continuously variable speeds and an rpm display would be the cat's meow.  Just make sure it is the real RPM, and not some fake number.  This wouldn't be a difficult improvement for PC to make, in fact, I have considered modifying my router to add it myself. Of course, when you have Black and Decker running the show, and you are selling the 7518 very successfully without it, why would you bother to update the product?
You should also know that this tool can be used in either the "push" mode or the "pull" mode whichever one suites you best.
3196	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I received my Bosch 39-15 yesterday and putit immediately to work.  I am re-doing a basement room and had to cut many boards for trim.  Out of the box it was in perfect alignment.  Quickly read the instructions and off I was.  I didn't experience a problem with dust any more than my chop saw by Dewalt.  It is very smooth.  The unit has a very smooth glide and moving the saw head to make the cut is effortless.  It took me months to decide which unit to buy.  This was the must sturdy unit I evaluated and it's ease of use helped me make my decision.  Amazon had the lowest price.  Ordering on line was great.  So simple and fast.  It was delivered in five days.  If you want to save a lot of money, buy this unit.  There isn't a saw that can compare to the quality of build on this saw.

  Even though I like these best out of all of the bar clamps, there is a limitation in bar clamps, in that the bar will bend when under pressure. Under normal gluing pressure, which is slight enough to mate the two surfaces firmly, but not enough so as to squeeze the glue out, their isn't a problem. Even if you need to exert more pressure to mate the surfaces, your final pressure should be slight.  Why am I concerned about this? Well I first bought these clamps thinking they would create a perfectly flat bed to lay your project in. If you are using the longer version, this becomes especially apparent. When under more pressure, the bar of the clamp is no longer straight. They all do that, it is inherent in the design of a bar clamp. An I beam shape would solve it, but is impractical, even on a tiny scale.

How much is one's time worth?  That's may vary but this blade and it's multitool can make it worthwhile, that's for sure.
This is a quality product, or at least mine has been.

Solidly (!) built, has enough weight to remain in place, light enough to hoist onto a low table or low bench (table is 16" high).
Would order another one if needed.
It adds mass near the CENTER of the blade so that tiny weight-discrepancies at the edge of the blade produce less wobble.  Less wobble = better cuts.
Note: Be sure to make sure the Arbor on your saw is long enough to take this whole set at its fullest width. Mine comes up a little short. you should always have at least THREE threads showing when the blade is installed. Mr RIDGID 4513 comes up short.

It seemed to work best on non-glossy paper. I had no trouble using this with regular paperback books. When I use this with a E-ink or a glossy page, such as a comic book, it has a lot of glare. I wish the light had a dimmer wider pattern setting for these sorts of books. You can usually find an okay angle with E-ink. This can be very frustrating with comics since you are continuously looking in different areas. I have the same problems with lamps and room lights in general so it is not just the book lights fault. It's easy to move a book when your by a stationary lamp, but when the light is attached to the book you have to move the light. This is my only complaint with this light and if they would have solved this problem it would be a perfect and amazing product.
I didn't need to touch the edge adjusting screws, the fit there was perfect.

They all take expensive batteries, don't shine bright enough, shine to bright, won't adjust the way I want (hate them all).  This one is perfect!  It takes triple A batteries, I use rechargeable, it also has an adapter with a long enough cord that it doesn't get in the way, it has two settings, light up the entire house and perfect light for reading in bed, and it will adjust any way you want to.  Wish I had found it a long time ago, could have saved me hundreds of dollars.

2474	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this saw to replace a 12 year-old Dewalt circular saw that still functioned but had significant signs of use. At first I did not like this saw because the handle and base are quite different than the Dewalt saws.  However, after a few uses, I have to say that this is a better saw.  It glides nicely for straight cuts.  The levers to adjust the cut depth and bevel are large and easy to use.  It is also surprisingly quiet and smooth in operation.

but not sure if that should be the case with a brand like Dewalt.
I have been using the table with a Triton MOF001 router and I had to drill my own holes for the mounting plate as well as the height adjustment tool.  I found it slightly difficult get the holes placed properly since there were so many other pre-drilled holes in the plate already.  Placing the template would result in placing a hole that would join a couple of other holes.

Aside from being stamped steel instead of cast aluminum, this modern version is every bit as functional as the originals, if not as cool.  Yes, they cheaped it up, but the same parts are there, doing the same jobs, just for less money.  If they were still cast aluminum, they'd probably be $200 or $300 these days.

I have been through several random-orbit sanders -- DeWalt, two from Bosch, Makita, Porter+Cable, and others.  Always, when I'm done sanding, my hair and face, and all surfaces in the shop, are covered in dust.  For days afterwards, I have to vacuum up the dust.  The dust flies around, the dust is all over my work clothes, the dust makes its way from my shop into the house.  It is dirty and it is unhealthy -- it is very dangerous to breathe fine dust particles.
So how does this all translate in the real world?  Wonderfully. . .if your criteria are precision over brute force and versatility over speed. This model has survived many years with little modification.  All the controls are placed where they should be placed, feel how they should feel, even after many years of use, and even after enough time has passed that most of the fine print etched onto the plastic housing has become unrecognizable.  The heft is enough to let you know you don't have a toy in your hand [approx. 14.2oz w/batt], but light enough for either gender and even for those challenged by limited range or motion that would restrict the use of a "manual" screwdriver, and balance is good [about 55/45 w/batt].

4935	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one, but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again.
The meachinism  for loading and unloading sander belts is very good.  It is easy to place  the belt in the sander and then tighten it up securely.
Buy one - you won't be sorry!

They lock tight, move smoothly and are made from steel just as thick as my DeStaCo's. They are also very affordable, which is more than could be said for the DeStaCo units.

9074	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I don't have a lot of cutting time on this blade yet, but I'm very impressed so far.  Cuts are clean, and fast.  I've been building a lot of outdoor furniture with PT pine, and the stuff I'm getting (2x4s) are stored outdoors and are always very wet.  Well I do dry them as best I can (stored under cover with lots of air circulation) but sometime they are still pretty wet.  My old blade cut them but it was slow work.  The blade was gumming up pretty bad and I was starting to get some burning even at a crawl.  Well this blade arrived just in time for me to do some onsite work (building deck railing benches).  Most of the wood was precut, but there are some custom cuts that need to be done onsite.  This blade worked like a charm (especially for the long angle freehand cuts I had to make.)  It zip thru PT lumber like nobodies business and does not bind or burn at all.  I use a table saw as much as possible, but for knocking down 8 footers I find the circular saw easier to use and much faster.  I will buy this blade again when the need arises.
Sometimes Amazon sells these as reconditioned. They make for a great deal.
Finally, this set is not cheap.  That may be a problem for a home woodworker.  If you can't afford it, the Freud set would be a good alternative.  If you want a set you will probably never have to replace, from a company who will resharpen it to a like new finish and balance, this is a great tool.
Estwing started making high-end tools in the Midwest over 90-years ago and they're still going strong for one simple reason.  They make the best tools you can get.  Amazing old school made here in the United States of America quality for an incredibly good price.

My only concern is for the gasket-like ring between the pad and body that helps with the dust collection and keeps the pad from increasing in speed when lifted off the work surface. In the instructions, it says that this ring is consumable and needs to be replaced once it's worn out. The kit comes with one spare ring but I have not been able to find these things anywhere so I'm worried about what I'll do when the second one wears out.

8660	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Used it to cut two inch concrete paver blocks and worked great.  Had to cut both sides then used a masonry chisel to break in two. Cut about 30 concrete blocks and still has cutting edge left.
8854	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Like almost everyone else here, I put off buying a premium combination square because of cost, and made do with cheaper combos, simple engineer's squares, various rules, etc.  Further, I hesitated because opinions on Starrett's quality varies among machinists and from tool-to-tool.  Many prefer Browne & Sharpe or Japanese lines like Mitutoyo.  In the end, I finally broke down and bought the Starrett, really as much because it's the only commonly-available premium combination square as for any other reason - and couldn't be happier with it.  It is accurate and smooth.  It's actually one of those few tools where you feel the quality every time you pick it up.  It's a pleasure to use it, so much so that I intend to pick up one of the 6" versions as well.


Also, the bulbs are individually packaged/wrapped within a bigger box which is great when you don't need to use all 10 at once - that way they stay stored more safely until needed.

The light is not so bright that it glares but is powerful enough for what he needs.

4385	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought my set a few years ago contempalting doing Dovetail joints.  I just pulled it out to use with my PorterCable 1501 router.  It would not fit my base plate.  Fortunately I found my old porter-cable router that has a base fixed in one place excepted the guides. I tried the 3/8" guide and found it to be  off-center or out of round. It would not fit in the router base.  Probably had it to long to get it exchanged. I've bought a lot of other Freud products and have been pleased, but this one surprized me.
Increased mass acts as a "heat-sink," drawing heat away from the cutting-edge. That improves cooling, which reduces pitch-build-up and increases blade-life.
I sold one of these when the house was built and kept one.  I have enjoyed the use of this saw and the only thing I can saw negatively about it is that the safety trigger sticks a bit (the little button on top).  So I needed to be aware that just because I took my finger off the switch, it stayed running sometimes because the trigger was still engaged.  I think it has something to do with putting pressure on the safety switch at a slight angle that causes it to bind.  I can't really fault the saw for the switch or the way I squeeze the button, and the saw is so accurate, it would be a disservice to blame Makita for the way I angle the pressure on the safety trigger.
290	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The light I got was an apparent Chinese knock off, it was in a plain white box and is poorly constructed.
Despite a few quirks, I very solidly give it FIVE stars.

  Also, if you are using angled cuts for short width pieces, tiny inaccuracies such as this, are not an issue.  The issue arises when the angle cuts are long as the slight inaccuracies become visible in the finished product.

6667	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have had this Model 1000 Dowel-It jig for several years now and it still works great for aligning dowel holes. I find it to be very accurate as well as simple to use with centering marks that are easy to read. It's made in the USA and will handle stock up to two inches wide. This jig and a biscuit joiner are two tools that I use often for shelf making. I particularly like that there aren't any loose insert bushings to deal with on this jig like many other dowel jigs use. I'd say that 1/4 and 3/8 inch dowels are probably the two sizes I use the most, but this jig will also handle 3/16, 5/16, 7/16 and 1/2 inch when needed.  Overall, this jig has held up well to my use and for what I cost, I think it was a good value.

 Due to its low power draw it can be used with smaller extension cords and smaller generators if being used where power is not available.  It has a long flexible power cord, a great sight line, no vibration.  The only thing I could think of that could be improved is it could use a more aggressive blower to blow the cut line clear.  But I suppose that if had a higher output blower on it someone might complain that it blew sawdust in their eyes.  As it is it doesn't do that but I find myself blowing the cut line clear on long cuts.  Cross cuts on 2x material aren't long enough to cause a problem but ripping 8 foot long sheets will cause the cut line to become obscure without some kind of help.

I prefer the barrel grip b/c it is easier for me to control. However, the handle model has all the same features, just a different grip configuration, so the choice is purely a personal one.
A few useful tidbits:
7565	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good rip fence. It actually comes with three thumbscrews. The new model Milwaukee saw uses one thumbscrew, & the old model uses two, so all three are included. I have owned both models, and the one with two thumbscrews works better. The new model I have now has the one thumbscrew that goes in at an angle & tends to turn the rip fence at an angle when tightened. It still works good, the rip fence is great, but the saw itself could have been designed better.

Patio furniture? II is fine.

The saw is well constructed.  I didn't have to make any adjustments out of the box.  It's noisy as all tools having universial motors are.  Motor brush life will be short for heavy users because of the dynamic braking feature.  The blade stops very quickly when you release the trigger.  A quieter induction motor would make the tool very heavy and probably usless.

2. Several holes were woefully misdrilled. Rather than screwing directly into the wood, most surfaces are joined by machine screws that thread into perpendicular metal cross dowels. This is great for the durability of the table. There are a series of pre-drilled, intersecting holes that accepted the screw and cross dowel, respectively. However, two or three of mine were misdrilled with the cross-dowel hole in the correct location but the would-be intersecting hole 2+ inches off. I had to drill a few myself.

The blade was stamped 'Made in England' and doesn't look bad actually - its well machined and finished for an 'out of the box (rather bubble) blade - but I have no idea of how hard it is, and thus edge retention, at this point.
This was the first set of raised panel bits that I've used and with a little patience and time to setup your router correctly it made beautiful doors.
The other thing worth mentioning is that if you have the work secured with a clamp, and can get both hands on the top grip, you can cut a perfect line with great control also. If you already own the top handle as I do, try cutting with it by grabbing the barrel instead and you will see what I mean.
Vacuum attachment is easily removed, I don't like my clunky vac hose dragging along while I'm edging (personal quirk maybe).

Usually followed by pointiong out that theirs only cost one third that much and had all these extra gadgets.  If it's the right day in the shop I point to a work in process and ask them to find one place where it is the least bit out of true.  And by 'least bit' I mean not at all.  This usually settles the argument right away.  When legs are square and cut right tables don't wobble.  When cases are square drawers fit perfectly, etc, etc.

This one is amazing, I used it to caulk seams at our 50 y.o. log cabin. I used dozens of tubes of caulk last weekend. You do need to disassemble and clean it after 30 tubes of caulk, went well and worked like a top when done. Before each tube was done it pushed out one loud pop of caulk but it was easily smoothed out. It was consistent and saved my hands. I'd highly recommend it but you do need to clean it out with some light solvent that dissolves the caulk but not the plastic/rubber.

  It does a decent job, but not as smooth as an older Freud 60 tooth that is no longer available. Of course a 60 tooth will give you a smoother edge than a 40 tooth, but both blades will rip a 3/4" piece of oak on an old Sears 1HP saw without a problem. The Freud TK306 in addition to not being flat toothed, also left a line about every eighth of an inch in the cut face. It was only a couple of thousandths deep, but deep enough to change the cut edge if sanded out. When their are other alternatives out there, I would rather not have to sand and alter my edge. Maybe it was just the one that I received, and others might not have that one protruding tooth, that probably is the cause of the problem.
136	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great light. This one is very flexible and does its job with no hassle. Even works well on a paperback.

The saw is much to easy to break or bend if not placed in some kind of case when transporting it. The size of this saw makes it very hard to find just the right size as well....
Another thing I've noticed in some reviews is that those who do not like these have the T-bar (Biesemeyer) style fences. Those fences do not lock at both the front AND back like fences on contractor saws.

  The insert blocks the blower from being able to get to the wood, so it is only cleaning off the top. Having used it both ways, it is nowhere near as good as eyeballing the blade.

6233	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw, besides having all the latest features (orbital, replaceable cord lock, keyless blade change, etc) this kit ALSO includes the Milwaukee Job Saw. It is a hand tool that accepts the same blades. No need to purchase this separately. It only has 2 blades included so its best to buy a blade kit (I prefer the 11 blade kit).
that's the easy part.
The bevel adjustment handle is large and sturdy and easy to adjust.  Bevel cuts on this saw are the best I have ever experienced.  It will cut bevels up to 51 degrees or so like butter.  No bogging or binding whatsoever.
The 7518 weights in at 18 pounds, which means you will need to be muscle bound to use it for delicate work.  For hand-help purposes I prefer one of the new 890 series, which offer 2.5 horsepower in a smaller package.  But where I find the 7518 unbeatable is in a router table.  Here you can take maximum advantage of its power and precision - especially for the rigorous tasks like running big panel-raising bits.  Used this way, I have nothing but superlatives to say for the tried and true 7518.

I bought the trashcan to go with it from my local home store and some of that foam weather stripping to line the inside of the lid where it makes contact with the can. It works great. Also, the flexible hose is supposed to go inside of it. I had the cheap grey flexible hose so it wasn't a snug fit. I would imagine that the clear stuff would fit more snugly. But that didn't really matter for me. I'm using this as a permanent set up so I just put a bead of caulking around the connection. Air tight, baby!

After assembling this one, the first thing I did was cut the drive belt between the two adjusting handles. The belt was not synchronized and I could not get the jaws to close evenly. The table release levers are too far forward and there is no place to put your foot to hold the bottom down as you lift the table. B&D took a well-designed workbench and ruined it.
5756	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A good replacement grinding wheel at a great price. I LOVE my Drill Doctor drill sharpener. I've thrown out countless drill bits as they dulled from use. With the Drill Doctor, I don't think I'll ever buy another drill bit again. These replacement wheels seem to be OEM and they perform as if they were.
I bought a newer model with the replaceable/removable cord just a few years back, and it too is going strong.
I will order the correct Riser Block and leave feedback when it arrives.
For general light use it is fine but unstable. Also the clamping mechanism is flawed and after a few years fails. I have had to make modifications to the workmate to make it usable because of that. You cannot clamp anything "really" solidly - excessive torque will lift the top surfaces and cause even more wobble. Beware this is an amateurs workmate. I use mine mostly as a table or a sawing platform. My bench vise does a better job of holding. had it too long to return it but I wish there was a better one.

8858	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this to cut off the bottoms of existing trimwork while installing new hardwood floors that replace carpet.  The carpet runs up to the bottom of the door casings, and the hardwood is thicker, so you have to cut off the bottoms.  Rather than peel the things off the wall and reinstall them, just cut them in place with this guy.  You can do about 95% of them - all you need is enough room to pull the saw.  I had a couple trim jobs that needed a power tool, but that was only because I couldn't get the saw in and pull it because of space or obstacles.  Flip over a piece of the flooring to use as a guide, saw along the top, and you're ready to install.  The results look great - a custom fit.  This is about as fast and MUCH quieter than the power tool.
3209	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought this base for my Rikon lathe, which weighs about 150-lb with its stand.  The corner supports seem to be well made and the wheels are heavy-duty.  After reading several reviews, I decided not to use hardwood for the 4 sides - the thought of drilling all those holes, in the right places and perfectly perpendicular, didn't set well with me.  Rather, I went to Lowes and bought their 1-1/2" pre-drilled steel tubes (see photos).  The pre-drilled holes are on 1-inch centers, so they're perfectly spaced for attaching the tubes to the four corner pieces - I didn't have to drill ANY holes.  I'm sure that saved at least an hour of set-up time.
Next I was cutting railroad ties with a 12" Lenox blade.  I  started out in the straight cutting mode and it was slow after the first  inch.  I switched to orbital action and the blade just about fell through  the wood!  I was making straight cuts and miters on 8" x 10" ties  with no problem.  I had used a chian saw in the past, but railroad ties  always have a "suprise rock" right in the path of your cut.  The  recip blades are basically disposable, so you can save the chainsaw for  less risky duty.
5038	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This router is a terrific value if you need a powerful router to put in your router table. At this price point, one does not expect electronic start!  The router is well-constructed and heavy - I would not recommend it for hand-held routing, unless you are Arnold Swarzenegger.  The finish is not top-notch, but who really cares for a router table router.  Runout is excellent.  I also installed the Router Raizer on it, and now it is a breeze for me to change bit depth from atop the table.  If you have the extra money, go for the Bosch, Porter Cable or DeWalt, but for my money it is perfect.
No way would ANYONE who was a pro want or use this thing.  It's seriously about 2 ft tall and doesn't have anything similar to a ruler on the whole thing, meaning you're going to be guessing (a) if it's lined up right and (b) if it's going to move while you use it.

Just below the questionable safety switch is a "momentary" switch[read "must keep pressing"] allowing your thumb to easily toggle the power in either direction.  And if you aren't already aware, "reverse" can be a very good thing and just like that time you got your car stuck in the mud, being able to toggle between forward and reverse quickly can be real handy.  However, unlike that particular fond memory, you won't hear any gears grinding.

There are some relatively new kids on the block that directly compete with this stick driver, most notably Panasonic's facsimile [a worthy adversary] and newest of all managing a more innovative form factor is Bosch's Ion stick driver, both of which cost a tad more than Milwaukee's version, but arguably have some advantages over this "classic".

My use is mostly rough carpentry, including framing, trusses, and decking.  I'm mostly pulling 8d and 12d (a few 16d) nails, and the spacing on the two ends seems to be perfect for that.  I like how it grabs the nails but it lacks slightly in weight (I'd actually prefer it to be a little heavier) and it doesn't have a punch to dent the wood around the nails for a cleaner removal.  The punch (found on the Exhumer and the Stiletto) is only a minor flaw since I don't get bonus points for making the wood pretty in my uses.
The tilt lock handle is fantastic. I cannot conceive of using a saw without it now that I have it;
An alternative to installing a new wheel is to reverse the existing one.  I.e., remove the current wheel, turn it end-over-end, and reinstall.  The drill bits I sharpened did not wear out the middle of the wheel, so reversing it provided new wheel life.  Once it's been reversed, and it's worn again, a new wheel is required.

2207	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Like so many others, I went with this Dewalt light because it uses the same 18v battery as my other cordless tools. Like so many others, I am very disappointed with these lights. I also own the DW908 and hate that thing too because you can never get the beam aimed where you want it. My buddy sprayed brake cleaner on that one to clean it off and the cheap plastic fused the power switch to the casing so it's toast. The DW919 is a whole other mess of poor design and even poorer usability. The head is too heavy for the flexible neck so its always toppling over or moving out of position. You have to constantly move the head back and forth to position the beam. The beam is very weak and dim even on a fully charged battery. After it moved for the hundredth time while working on a brake job, I threw it out of the way and the flexible neck broke where it attaches to the head. Good riddance to this piece of junk. I love my other Dewalt tools but I'm going with another brand for my work lighting.

7155	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	All steel - unlike the parallel clamps,there are no plastic parts to break (I spun the plastic handle off a Jet clamp and have busted parts on my Bessy's) - the Jorgensen I-Beams may cost more, but in the long run they are a bargain as I'll never need to replace or repair them.  Clamping pressure far exceeds parallel clamps (can close joints the other clamps can not).  I-Beams barely flex.  They will last and work until someone lets them turn to rust, which is not likely to happen.  Made in USA by my fellow countrymen who have a job and support our Nation - Buy American!!!!
Template guides are useful when routing out a piece of work using a template as a guide. The appropriate size guide to accomodate the size router bit, simply attaches to your plastic or metal removable center base plate, using the template guide, and a threaded metal securing ring. The gap distance between the outer edge of the template guide, and the leading edge of your router bit, is the oversize dimension you have to make your template. The template guide prevents the edge of the router bit from touching your template. The protruding nipple-collar accomplishes that. To accomplished routists that earn a duh no kidding award, but to the new guys on the block, that is key to know, and opens up a new world, and a reason to buy the kit.

Only a few negatives:  the description said it had a 4" opening for dust collector.  It is 2 1/2" so ended up with buying an unnecessary adaptor to my 2 1/2 system.  The dust collector vent is on top so shavings falling down into the table build up and must be manually removed.  Yes, this may be petty, but I thought the purpose of a dust collector was to get nearly all the shavings. Lastly, I wish that the router plate had a hole for the adjusting key for my Porter-Cable.router.  I would rather not start drilling out holes which might mess up another router configuration.

2358	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I've literally used several of these routers until there death.  Probably 5 or 6 at least. Both as what they were intended for as well as other applications.  I own a cabinet shop and we are very hard on them. Porter Cable was once the king of routers, they have been replaced by Bosch.  This was also confirmed by a major tool company who used to use this particular trim router in a industrial pocket cutter. They have since converted to the Bosch equivalent at great expense and retrofitting.  I've also tried to replace the cord on a few of these and they are very fussy on the inside.  It just doesn't like to go back together nicely either.  Keep 2 stars in perspective as I am comparing this router to real tools like Makita, Bosch, Milwaukee, Festool.... not home owner Black and Decker and Ryobi garbage.

I have not tried any other type board bow fixers, but this did the job easily.
It seems that a lot of people had problems putting the pins in. To put in the pin I greased the hole in the vise screw, greased the pin, squeezed one end of the pin, ran the pin in and out of the vise crank hole to loosen the hole. The trick is to turn the vise screw so the hole is pointing up, lightly grease the hole AND PUSH the vise screw towards you. (This is important cause if you don't then when you push and tap in the pin into the vise crank onto the vise screw the holes might not be aligned and go in.) Once you push the vise crank onto the vise screw, align the holes, push the pin into the vise crank and feel that it is seated(onto the groove) to the vise screw hole (make sure that the vise screw is still pushed towards you). Put your hand under the vise crank to hold it while you now lightly tap the pin with a small hammer. Use your hand to hold it up while you're tapping. Do the same to the other vise cranks.

5748	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent quality hose that will not kink. The two tools that come with the hose are OK but initially they were difficult to attach to the light gray end of the hose. The gray end piece was slightly misshaped probably from packing. After a couple of tries it stretched out enough to fit on the tools although very snug fitting. That said, I would strongly suggest you go to mrnozzleinc.com site to get the ID and OD dimensions for this kit before you purchase it. I have a stainless steel version of the Shop Vac brand wet-dry vacuum and the hose is a 2 1/2" with a screw-in swivel hose attachment. The Mr Nozzle hose (black end) fits inside the existing hose attachment opening but it is held in place by friction and it does not insert very far in. One good tug and out comes the hose. The gray end is for 1 1/2" nozzles. I'm purchasing three different adapters which is equal to 2/3rds of the cost of the kit so I can jury-rig  the original Shop Vac swivel end to the new hose. I originally was going to buy the "raw" hose from Amazon and purchase some adapters to make the connections. I changed my mind and decided to buy a finished product that included a couple of cleaning tools. I figured for a few dollars more I wouldn't have to mess with the hose and get some extra attachments as a bonus. Boy was I mistaken. The description on Amazon stated: "Designed to fit all standard wet/dry vacs". That is not the case.
-  Initial set-up was straightforward, it came with all the parts, and it was easy to adjust the height of the end rollers to match the height of my miter saw.

2178	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have owned and used this saw daily for 3 years and I have never been disappointed.  It was specifically purchased for the construction of a 12' x 17' storage shed and was used to cut everything from 2 x 4's and window trim right up to a laminated 4 x 12 beam.  Mitre cuts, cross cuts and compound mitres in all materials is a breeze, but invest in the proper blades for the job and keep them sharp (goes without saying but I never cease to be amazed).
These saws: 1. cut a thin kerf; 5. are very sharp; 6. allow you to do precision cutting.
4256	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I have a 3hp Jet table saw that went up in flames last week. Well at least the motor did.
I didn't suspect much until I got the hose and noticed a couple of things. Though it seems to be hit or miss, the fittings on mine were mis-threaded as well. I tried to attach this hose to a hose reel and the fitting was very difficult to thread and only went on a few turns before not being able to go any further, even with a wrench. Also, the hose itself did NOT have the Mit diamond trademark signifying a genuine goodyear hose, and the goodyear markings that are there were put on sloppily and were starting to rub off.
The only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries. It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.

6809	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This toolbox is made of solid metal, which is pretty nice because plastic stuff breaks eventually.  This thing feels solid.  It has a nice top drawer that you can pull out.  I use this as my toolbox between going between my two houses, I keep a small cordless drill and its charger, some caulk, a level, a hammer, drill bit set, safety goggles, utility blade, small flashlight, tape measure, a bunch of screws and nails of various lengths and maybe a few other small things that I'm forgetting (ahh, pliers and a couple of screwdrivers).  It is a little bit of an exercise to get all of this into this relatively small tool box, but I actually like the small size of it.  Easy to pack into the car, sturdy, etc.  For the simple user, it is perfect.  If you're a pro, you probably need one of the metal boxes with drawers.

  Even though I like these best out of all of the bar clamps, there is a limitation in bar clamps, in that the bar will bend when under pressure. Under normal gluing pressure, which is slight enough to mate the two surfaces firmly, but not enough so as to squeeze the glue out, their isn't a problem. Even if you need to exert more pressure to mate the surfaces, your final pressure should be slight.  Why am I concerned about this? Well I first bought these clamps thinking they would create a perfectly flat bed to lay your project in. If you are using the longer version, this becomes especially apparent. When under more pressure, the bar of the clamp is no longer straight. They all do that, it is inherent in the design of a bar clamp. An I beam shape would solve it, but is impractical, even on a tiny scale.

Everything from the professional grade 1/2" chuck to the heavy duty detachable cord shows Milwaukee's committment to reliability and longevity.  I ordered this through Amazon and received the 75th Anniversary unit and it came with a steel case.  Wasn't expecting the additional amenities, but you get lucky sometimes, I guess.
I also have their hatchet. Simply awesome. I remember as a kid my dad having one of these, he probably still does, even my brother and I could not wreck it.
A great little invention!  This one replaces another I had for years and abused it thoroughly.
I am back a little more than 2 years since I bought this router and it is holding up very well.  I've used bits up to 2 inches in diameter for raise panel work and the router has done great.  The one that I had on my milling machine is still there and still working!  It sat unused for a whole year and I just recently fired it up to mill finials for some gable trim I am currently making.  I was worried that it may have froze up after sitting for so long but the motor started up as soon as I hit the switch.  Thank you Porter Cable!
This is a great little tool to have in your wood working arsenal, especially if you're just getting into woodworking. It'll last a long time and give outstanding performance once it's tuned up. Google "how to tune up a block plane" for all the different methods people use.

2964	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I originally had a R***i from[local store], purchased because I'd had good luck with all the other R***i tools I have. This was my first scroll saw, learning curve and all that. The light quit, then the upper blade holder broke from the mighty twisting of my feeble arthritic grip, I suppose. Took it back. Now being familiar with scroll saw problems, particularly pierceing cuts / blade handeling, vibration, etc, did more research, decided on the DeWalt design. Great price and shipping time here at Amazon. The DeWalt saw? What a sweet machine this is! Smooth as silk, no vibration compared to other designs until the speed is near the max,quieter than the wife's sewing machine, the table / blade zeroed right out of the box. I'll be happily sawing for years to come on this baby. I will agree with the others though, on the hold down foot, it's the one weak point of the design. Most fretwork guys abandon them anyhow. (Not a reccomended practice.) Some have the scars to prove it!

1762	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good quality machining and parts. The only complaint I have is that it is relatively heavy and can cause the router to wobble if you don't have well supported base or work surface.
2454	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well made and have everything that I need to get a straight edge  with minor correction from my router with clean results.  The only criticism that  I have is the numbering of this item.  I bought the DNP618  originally  thinking that it fit my router, the DW618, because of the numbering.  I then had to place a second order to get the correct edge guide.  The factory makes good products, but they don't know how to number their products.
5527	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My recent purchase was my third M12V. My first was in 1991 at a tool show .One thing that really impresses me is there is no vibration,no jerking at start-up. I have not had any problems with any of them-- they all are working just fine. This is a great all around router for handheld use or table use.
Keep in mind that the splitter/kickback device is removable and replaceable in seconds; also keep in mind that this splitter is for 1/8" blades only.  Thin kerf blades will not work with this unit. A three horsepower and higher saw does not require a thin kerf blade. They are meant for lower horsepower contractor and bench saws since the thin kerf allows for easier cutting pressures.
Great saw, Bosch craftmanship is superior, no problems what so ever changing blades, no complaints.  I highly recommend this product.
109	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It has taken a lot of abuse from children and has not broken!! The batteries have lasted a long time even though the kids have left it on overnight several times. The brightness settings are good too.

The uniguard is a blade  guard you won't remove.  The two split halves rotate back independently, so  you can still guard the blade when cutting very thin pieces.  And the guard  hangs from above and rests on the work, so you can use it when performing  non-through cuts.
Overall great saw - I'd reccommend it - it's well worth the price.

2575	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The packaging was excellent, in a sturdy box and the tool was well-protected inside. This unit is heavy, which helps to dampen vibration often found in other units. Access to the lower blade clamp is a little difficult, causing one to bend down and use a flashlight to get the blade properly seated. This tool uses plain-end blades - no pins - which for some might be a negative. However, this allows using finer blades than you can get with pin-end ones. I have seen some scroll saws that take either. This unit is very quiet and the large table is good for stability, minimizing 'chatter' even at the highest speed. Angle adjustment for the table is fairly easy, but I recommend using a gauge rather than relying on the scale below the table. The blower is weak, so I push the nozzle up and out of the way. I would like to have seen some sort of work light mount, but there being none, I found an inexpensive gooseneck lamp and place it on the table next to the saw. Overall, I am pleased with the tool and have used it quite a bit for marquetry and cutting parts for a wood-gear clock.

Other reviewers said that they had a hard time judging which chipper is which.  There are 4 in the set.  Two 1/8", one 3/32" and one 1/16".

4962	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great sander, well worth the money to me.  I saved thousands of dollars by not getting a new deck so it was also a bargain. I had a 40 year old Sears 3 X 21 inch belt sander that served me well for years, but it started breaking the sanding belts, and drifting the belts sideways a lot, so it was not useful anymore.  This sander did not break a single belt, and I wore out several of them with no breakage.  The unit is well engineered, and the engineers recognized that the biggest enemy of a sander doing this much work was getting the heat and dust away from the sander as quickly as possible.  It has very serious blower in it.  I didn't even attempt to use that little bag for the deck I was doing, at first I hooked it up to my shop vacuum with an adapter I made.  Then I realized that I didn't even need the vacuum, the sander had such a powerful blower.  So then I just hooked up a vacuum hose going to a 5 gallon bucket, with the hose going through a scrap cloth sheet held on the top of the bucket by the rubber seal that comes with the bucket lid.  That saved unloading the heavy shop vacuum, I just dumped the large amount of sawdust from the bucket periodically.  Do not attempt to use this sander without a means to collect the dust.  This is a serious heavy powerful tool, not for a weak person.  With the motor electrical trigger locked on, it can get you in trouble fast if you are not holding on with good support.  It also would be difficult working on vertical or underneath surfaces being so heavy.  I only did the flat walked on surfaces of my deck, which were the most worn and in need of sanding.  Then I stained it with Home Depot Behr opaque, water clean-up stain.

8953	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have not used the product yet, but I expect it to perform as it should. I bought it on reputation alone after reading many reviews about various dado sets.
Bottom line, you can not beat what this joiner gives you for the money and you can get excellent results if you use it right.
So, be prepared for somewhere between a moderate and large engineering feat to sharpen tools.  If you have a steady hand, I use the fixed cast slider directly for my chisels.  Sometimes I throw in a shim or wood jig, but I now want a steel jig, and that's a bit of a 3D design and custom made parts feat.
I compared this against the larger DeWalt, but this one won based on price. As to performance, they are probably equal.
3062	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	As a novice at routing, I was puzzled for a while when I bought router bits that would not fit through the hole in the router base. Lo and behold, after reading an Amazon review I learned that you could buy an optional sub-base with a larger whole that would accommodate larger bits. I needed to round the edge of a 1" piece of oak, and the rounding bit has a "shoulder" that needed to be above the work surface. So the larger hole in the sub-base enabled me to raise the bit so that only the curved portion engaged the wood. Evidently the thinking behind the smaller hole is to make the router more stable for hand-held use, but I found it no problem to work with the larger hole. I totally agree with whoever said that this base should come standard with the router - with as much as router tables cost, you need this flexibility to maximize what you can do in the hand-held mode.

5793	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I should have probably sent it back but thought I could turn it into something useful.  It it is definately not the plane I expected, even for this price which was $30 when I bought it.  This plane is beyond rough - there is a tremendous amount of work to do to get it even usable.  The blade is misshapen, skewed,dull, and the body is rough.  I'll flatten the blade and sharpen it and flatten the sole but for the work it will take, I should have bought a Lee Valley for this one.

BUT--if used correctly, this tool does remove paint. It is slow, paint dust goes everywhere, and you must wear a respirator mask and a face shield.
- The over-45 degree angle cuts are more a marketing gimmick than really useful - it takes more than trivial adjustments to bring this setup around.  And then you have to un-do everything to get the stops back to 45.

Thought maybe the first one was a factory defect, but worked through all of them and found that NONE of the blades in this pack cut.

In retrospect, I'm not sure why I avoided the purchase but the right job came up, a pile of old, full of barn dirt,  rough sawn Oak, that needed cleaning before planning. It only took about 2 seconds of sanding to realize this sander was going to prove to be a good investment. Now, I regularly use it to remove glue on panel glue ups. It's not the most used tool in the shop, but I've found when I need it, it pays for itself every time.

UPDATE FEBRUARY 2009 - When I bought this unit, I figured it'd be good for maybe a year or two.  Four years out, it continues strong.  It has an annoying tendency for the chip chute to clog up from time to time, which takes a bit of effort to unclog.  But it does great work, and with a little bit of care ensuring your alignment is clean, it works well.  Wish all of my tools were as bulletproof.
About twice the price - (but if it last will actually save cash)

I've also tried the beadlock system (where you drill a 3-4 hole dowel in).  It makes a super strong joint, but I find the plate joiner is easier to get a flush joint.
My only complaint about this set is the packaging.  Freud needs to come up with something more robust than a soft plastic box with a paperweight, blow-molded interior.  The interior arrived damaged from the blades.

UPDATE I was hanging out at Woodcraft last Saturday and this guy walks in...to return an auger bit.  The pointy tip on the bit was not on the same axis as the drill bit.  He rotated the bit and I looked at the pointy thing, and it was tracking a circle 3/32" in diameter.  That explains why the drll won't drill a square hole.

Then when you decide which ones  work for what you need you just replace  those blades. I don't personally buy multi blade packs except when I get a  new saw and they come with it. But if you don't really know what kind of  blades you like, try one of these. You can learn a lot with one project.

The product was packaged efficiently, the parts organized, and it assembled in a couple minutes. I bought a smaller workmate about 10 years ago and it finally gave up the ghost (mostly due to me banging it around and over using it).  I went straight to Black & Decker once the decision to buy a new workbench was made. I received free shipping when I bought this item. Very nice deal!

I just grabbed a little PVC and epoxy from the store and made it work.
I also own a craftsman router witn 1 3/4 hp and it has a switch lock which frees one hand to hold down thr router or to adjust router bit height while tightening the collet. I find the craftsman so much easier to change bits.
Then it occurred to me to file the chain for ripping rather than cross-cutting.  I had the chain filed at 15 degrees.  What a difference!  It crosscuts more quickly than ever (although only by a small margin) but on rips the difference is night and day.  It cuts at least three times faster now.  Try it, you'll like it.

6052	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I agree , this is better than any other available holsters. It does  protect your leg. Thats in itself makes it superior. In addition you get  extra storage in the side pockets. Kind of like having a mini bucket boss  right there in front of your tool bags. It's still not secure enough for me  though.  I hate when my drills take a dive. They get dropped enough as it  is. Who has the patience to strap a drill in every time they use it? I've  been on a lot of jobs and have seen hundreds of drills in holsters. I've  seen about two that were actually strapped in. The only holder I trust  completely is the Prazi Big Lugg. It is far superior for keeping your drill  stuck to your side. Just drop it in and you're good to go.  Bend over, lay  down , jump , It doesn't matter. It's still there. Impossible with a  holster. So I have mixed feeling about this product. It is the best in it's  class. But I think that class is losing favor with the Big lugg on the  market.
3872	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bosch makes great products. I have the cordless tool set which is awesome! This compliments my jigsaw. These blades last a long time and cut very well. They were great for cutting laminate counter tops. They didn't rip or cause any damage.

6142	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	For the price, it's a great addition. The cyclone top does not make a real seal with the top of your 5-gallon bucket. I took the rubber seal out from my bucket lid and glued it around the lip of the top with some silicone caulk so that it forms a press-fit seal when I push it down on the bucket. This makes a good seal, but the top is still not terribly secure, so good idea--as others have said--to wrap a bungee or web strap around the bucket to hold this in place.

7924	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These last a long time, and really only die after hitting a few nails. I always keep a spare one around. I have never found them to cut perfectly straightly, despite lots of trying, but since I mostly use them for small trimming and flush cuts, it's ok.
I bought this set as well. Why? Because when making kitchen cabinets, the raised panel bit that they provide with the 5 piece set is too small for a large cabinet. (Unless you prefer that look) So I bought this set, to pick up the 3 1/2" panel raising bit. That requires a large opening of at least 3 5/8" on the bottom of your router, and the opening on your router table as well. The Bosch 1619EVS is even larger than that. The Fein RT-1800 allows for the the use of a 3 1/2" bit, but the casting prevents you from plunging a bit that size. Not really recommended, because you might accidently adjust it into the base. Their are others also, but most fixed base 2 HP routers won't accept such a large bit. So measure first.
Getting the right width seems to be my issue, and instructions seems to be lacking. Maybe I should follow the diagram!
7823	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a good hammer. Check the weight. Hammers of the same brand vary. Some are heavier than other due to the user and task. The quality is excellent.

This is one beefy machine with tons of power to cut anything.  I tried twisting it in a cut to test it and it only slowed a little, while the P-C nearly stops!  A great buy for DIY-er or professional.

I've had Chinese stuff that broke or chipped in the most mundane applications and so I made a promise to myself to Buy USA Tools whenever possible. This basic claw hammer is American made and you can tell the difference. The grip is solid and controllable. The claw is at the correct angle and the overall geometry is perfect. Balance is terrific and will make it easier to swing this hammer like a real man.  All of this comes at a reasonable price. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for a tool that won't let you down.
7482	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Kreg is simply the best, use coarse threads for plywood, the pocket hole system is fast and simple and works great.
Sept 07 - I finally got around to working on this plane.  Took a little more than an hour to flatten the back of the blade (can't get it completely flat) and hone the bevel.  I also lapped the sole of the body.  It works slightly better now, but it's a very crude adjustment.  With more work, I could probably improve a little more, but I felt it was more work than it should have been.  Patrick Leach who is arguably the authority on planes really dislikes this model too.  This one works now, but definately nothing to write home about.  Can't say I would ever reach for it other than scraping glue and frankly, I have a #80 cabinet scraper that does a better job at that.  I'd give it away, but there is no sense frustrating someone else.

Once tightened, remove the nuts/bolts and now use the Delta 2" nut that came with the kit.

4985	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This industry standard machine offers economical flexibility, power and utility -- and does so for a very long time.  The small, tight angle head can sneak a whole bunch of torque into some very small places.  The head  can easily be adjusted right, left, up or down giving the user a lot of  options when facing a tight-place job.  The balance of the machine as well  as the thoughtful positioning of the controls make it seem as though your  hands are fully trained in its use the first time you pick it up.  The  gearing and fine working right angle drive make it almost impossible to  stop this durable motor.  (But you can do it in a pinch - an ode to the  motor design)  Last year I had to change the brushes for the second time in  26 years of use.  Most people get better wear than this, but in my  renovation endeavors I have used this machine for everything between  removing a tractor tire to a make-do winch.  Other attributes:  The  auxillary handle is built as well as the machine itself, and is very  useable.  The box is standard Millwuakee tough should last through the life  of the tool.  If you install plumbing vents in frame houses every day, you  would do better with the venerable 1676 Hole-Hawg by the same manufacturer.

As for the blades themselves, they are clearly made with care. They come razor sharp and are very pleasantly sturdy. The teeth are all cut cleanly, with no errant machining marks or burrs to clean up.

8366	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My first Dado Blade set.  Instructions for set up on the saw are non existent in the package.  However, after searching youtube and the Web, I found a video that explained pretty well how to do it.  My saw is a Delta 36-725, it is not easy to exchange blades and even more of a challenge to install the Dado blades.  (There is a blade guard that is not easily removed that you have to contend with) That is not the fault of the blade, once I was able to get the blades on and set up on the saw I made a beautiful Dado in a test piece of softwood. The results were worthy of the 5 stars I gave it.  Very nice - flat bottom, sharp shoulders and straight edges.  I would recommend this tool.  For the price, it does a superb job!
Additional Comment:  I've used the miter finder on a couple crown molding jobs and it worked great!  But I have since bought a Denali (cheap) angle gauge and because of it's smaller size that's the tool that I grab first.  It's to bad the Bosch unit wasn't made to fit in your palm and then have extendable wings for working over larger surfaces.

I finally have a machine that holds the blade tightly and is easy to thread into pilot holes.the blower works great. Having the arm tilt is an invaluable feature for me. I am not crazy about the hold down...the arms are too far apart for some of the small work I do. But other than that, a fantastic machine, and getting the stand free is a great incentive. A built in light and blade holder would nice added features.

Top-Well made and easy to attach.
Aside from the few walking human safety hazards that have reviewed this product here on Amazon, most of what has been said is true.  The box the 425 comes in is HORRIBLE, and falls apart in shipping, or even when trying to get it out of the trunk of the car and into the garage.  But you don't use the box, do you?  Yes, it can be a little time consuming to put together, but you'll get there.  Don't tighten the bolts for the top until you get them ALL on, and clamp the vise screws down tight.  Then the table boards will align to each other, and you can final torque the fasteners.
The book light is well-made and has a rugged casing.
The tray is 12 3/4" wide, 8 3/4" deep, and 1.5" high. The tray's ends are bent downward into  half-circles which rest on the top edge of the case sides to support the tray.  This approach eliminates the need for separate tray supports in the case itself; a good idea as they would be in the way when the tray isn't used.
If I could return it I would, unfortunately I put it together well after the return period had expired.
The clip is very strong and is flat on one side, so you can even use it as a stand on a flat surface.  No matter how much I twist the light's neck, it never seems to affect the light.

My overall opinion of this thing is that "Quality Control" simply consisted of making sure it fit in the package it came in.  I gave it one star ONLY because it isn't possible to give it a negative number of them.  This overpriced piece of junk deserves somewhere around a negative two or three stars.

Once in my fixture, the light is a little more yellow in tint and seem not as bright as the other bulbs I have in a bathroom fixture. This could be due to the shorter size, or the shorter size + the bulb being made differently from one brand to another.

 They have the adjusting allen head studs so you can get it perfectly flat with your saws top. Unlike the PMatic factory inserts, these are flat and true. If you take your factory insert, turn it upside down on the cast iron saw top, and press down on the corners, sure enough it will rock. The Leecraft doesn't do that.

  Another little complaint is that the blade only tilts to the left.  I was cutting some very small delicate molding at 45 degrees and the blade kept splitting the wood because of the way it was placed on the saw.  If I could have tilted the blade to the right and put the fatter side of the molding against the fence it would have worked better.

My chief complaint is that the chart they include that tells you which blades/spacers/chippers to use to get a certain width was not accurate.  I made test cuts according to their chart and measured with my calipers and the width was not accurate.  So I suggest building your own guide.  Just take a scrap piece of wood and use the different blades/spacers/chippers until you get the desired width.  Then record the configuration right on the wood next to the cut.
For the craftsman, however, I doubt there is a better hand-held power drill in this class for tough boring jobs in wood, metal and other materials. Even the boatbuilder guys love this drill and that's worthy of note because they tend to stick to powerless hand tools partially out of a sense of tradition and an appreciation for well-made things, but more practically for the extra attention to detail and precise control that hand tools allow. This drill appeals to all of those things. Aside from some lighter material upgrades, the basic design has been around for generations, it is very well-made, easy to maintain and it's precise and smooth operating, making it easy to control.

6215	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I received these is a very timely manor and was greatly surprised how they worked in the application that I was using them in.  I have used other "off branded" blades which didn't do near as well as these have.  For reference purposes I will never give a 5 star rating since that to me means perfection and we all have room to improve.
I fixed the problem using 1" wooden shims on the back rail and a couple of longer 1/4" 20 screws that were long enough to compensate for the extra depth created by the shims.
2) They suggest using a hardwood as the boards will be so thin you shouldn't use Doug Fir. Again, if you used a standard size that would not be necessary. A 2x4 doug fir is plenty strong and is about 3$ these days, using a hardwood would be a lot more expensive. I assume people who purchase this product would probably have enough spare/scrap 2x4 in their garage/basement that with a standard size you don't have to make a trip to get the hardwood. I ended up ripping a 2x4 into strips and attaching an additional strip as a workaround.

I didn't have any regular hard wood pieces sitting around to make the rails so I laminated some baltic birch together then cut that into strips to size and used that. Seems to be fine. The carriage bolts supplied are just barely long enough. Definitely not long enough to add lock washers to. I stripped one when tightening so think the bolts may be rather soft. I did notice that the nuts a ever so slightly oversize on their outside dimension so had to use a well worn open end wrench or adjustable (probably imported). No big deal really. I may go ahead and buy some longer better grade carriage bolts and nuts as I like using lock washers on stuff and having a full 100% thread engagement. The mechanism to raise and lower is simple, strong, clever and effective. All in all I don't think these mobile bases can be beat for the price. No crappy plastic parts. Should last a lifetime or two and will save my old back a lot of problems from now on.
4162	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great addition for my Hitachi C7ST circular saw.

The light really is very, very even with no fall-off or shadows within the beam. It easily covers facing pages of a hardcover book, and it doesn't quite illuminate all of a textbook. The light stops pretty abruptly at the edge, which is a good sign - there's no fade off. After so many years of using b-list, subpar book lights, I didn't think I could get one for less than $50 that would be any good. Totally wrong!

Bottom line: I can't think of anything I'd change.  Would be a tich nicer for clipping onto books if the battery box was lighter and thinner.  But you can't get AAAA batteries just everywhere, and they wouldn't last as long.  Also if the battery box was much lighter, you couldn't use it as a lamp base.
Great product, thanks.
The 1/32"+ "crown" that the brilliant "engineers" decided to manufacture into this plate make's any raised panel, edge, or joint forming work infuriating, and impossible to achieve accurately. It also looks very "cheap", the top surface is very slippery, and it scratches easily. What initially "caught my eye" and made this plate appealing were the "2in1" plastic insert rings, they looked like a nice feature. They fit extremely tight though, and removal without a hammer or pry bar was not really possible unless you modified them. Needless to say, I returned it. I purchased a very nice machined 1/4" aluminum plate from Rockler instead that it IS flat, and has an very nice anodized coating. It works excellent! I highly recommend that you save yourself the time and money I lost and do the same. Keep in mind that the aluminum plates also have different sized inserts you can buy or you can get a solid one that you can drill out for a custom size.
4990	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I stopped using my Crapsman belt sander a long time ago. It was more work than it was worth. When I ran into a particularly difficult wood that even my Lie-Nielsen planes, at the highest angles and with the sharpest blade irons, couldn't plane without chip out, I had only two options: scrapers or a belt sander.  Because of the amount I had to remove, I chose the belt sander.  So I broke down and bought a real belt sander.
4894	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This model is very quiet and has a smooth deliberate action. It makes very acurate cuts but takes longer to set up. It is a good value for the money and is $50 less than the Porter Cable model.  I was impressed by the sheer weight and balance of this plate jointer. If you want simplicity and acuracy then the Dewalt DW682K is for you!

I am not totally surprised at the fact that DeWalt is having the manufacturing problem.  I *am* surprised that they are doing little or nothing to fix it.  At the very least I suggested that they put a quality check in place at the factory to check for this problem before they shipped out the saw and reject the ones with the problem.  They have NOT done this, but instead tell their support people to ask the customer to "drill out the holes to allow the bolts to move over".  Not on a brand new $500 saw thank you!  We even asked the product manager if he could have someone in his distribution center open a box to check a saw for us and ship us a known good one; but he declined saying "he didn't have anyone who could do that".  DeWalt is a better company than this and they shouldn't be allowing this kind of poor quality.
6609	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this insert to attached my 3 1/2 hp Milwaukee router for table use.  I spoke directly with the manufacturer with my request for a template to accommodate my router.  I spoke with three people and finally an engineer I spoke with simply stated they did not provide one for my router.  No offer of any kind of assistance.  I had to approximate the layout, using the Milwaukee stock base plate as a guide.  This task is more difficult than you may assume, depth of recess and spacing of the 3 screw holes needs to be exact.  My effort is pretty close, since I had a business associate drill and counter bore the three holes for me at his prototype Lab. Even so, a Rousseau provided template would have been more accurate than using the base plate turned out to be.  I would think that providing one would be very easy for them to produce - even send to a client as an email attachment, with a depth and drill size recommendation.  No customer service focus at Rousseau that I could find.

8494	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	GOOD!!!!!!
The only negative that I've had with this is that it extends the length of the drill out about another 2 to 3 inches.  When I'm doing tight work in cabinets, it gets a bit challenging to use. Other than that, it's the only bit I always keep with my drill.


2135	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The photograph is misleading because it looks like a flimsy, toothpicky kind of support. Actually it is a very well made, heavy support worthy of the DeWalt table saw for which it was designed. I use it for supporting long boards and relatively heavy sheets of three-quarter inch plywood. I've owned my DW744XRS table saw for a couple of years, and all this time I've used "horses" for my outfeed and side supports. Talk about an "I-coulda-had-a-V-8" moment, when I first discovered the ease and efficiency of this invaluable accessory I was awestruck. If you own a DW744, these supports should be your next purchase.


2635	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The original bulb, though very yellow, was very "floody". This new bulb, and yes it is very white which is nice, is VERY spotty. It's great for looking at long-distances, but for up close work, like contractors use for working under kitchen sink's or crawling under crawlspaces, I cannot recommend, it is not just spotty but is a VERY narrow beam and has almost no flood to it at all.  In my opinion, they messed it up considerably and a white like this should have some flood do it

7660	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Gotta agree with everyone else that this is a fantastic tool.  Works really well.  This was my first time using a powered caulk gun and I was able to immediately use it like a pro.  Loaded a Liquid Nails sublfoor glue cartridge, dialed in about 25 psi, and laid a perfect 1/4" bead, very quickly.  Didn't have to wait on the gun, and didn't blow my fingers out squeezing.  A quality machine and for a great price.
The main reason I am writing this review, honestly, is to respond to the negative review here questioning whether or not these are still made in the USA.  YES, they ARE.  And according to a plumber who works at my lab, these are the gold standard for pipe wrenches.  They have a lifetime warrantee and the jaws and other parts can be replaced at a fraction of the cost of a whole wrench.  I also asked him about aluminum wrenches and he was down on them--thought this line was better (and cheaper).
9214	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	got exactly what I ordered quickly.  I needed a new battery because I lost mine so this is exactly what I needed

4776	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Lots of power and torque for fast sanding and material removal. Dust collection works well and the bag is easy to remove and empty but with one small issue. The bag connection angles upward and so you need to put the sander on end to remove the bag and not have a lot of sanding material fall out onto the floor.
1824	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good blades for a really good saw.

Holds its setting very well, no issues here.  The long edge guide is very helpful and a must when doing cabinet work.  The edge guide is low profile when the vacuum port is removed.  However, chip build-up around the base becomes a problem.  I highly recommend this attachment.
Many people that complain about not using this or heavier really needs to practice and get used to it before going to work with it. It is a great companion that will last a lifetime.
Overall, I feel these are an excellent addition to an arsenal of safety devices. It is up to each woodworker to know what is best for his needs and select the right option for each task. I do not mind wasting a little material to protect my hands, get perfect multiple thin strips with only one set up. I consider that cheap insurance against tragedy and assurance of accuracy. When making many multiple cuts the same size, it is a real time saver too! One set-up (which take less than twnety seconds) yields perfectly consistent rips of thin strips.
Compares very favorably with Record and Pony equipment purchased in the past.  Wood handle will eliminate vise-bite that my sons still remember from their younger days. [so will a rubber washer if retrofitting.]

7754	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was so excited when Amazon offered me this hole saw set to review, I actually had a craft project that I needed one for, this definitely is not just for electricians but comes in handy many times for plumbing jobs, crafts, and various do-it-yourself home projects. Just things like drilling hoes in an entertainment center for passing cables always drove me crazy trying to do with drill bits alone, when one of these would have made easy work of the job. For the project I was doing I needed an approximately 4" sized hole, and this kit included a saw that was just right, even though there were no instructions it was very easy to figure out how to attach the saws and my project was done in no time flat. The saws are a very high quality, as were the drill bits and holders included, this set definitely will last a lifetime if used properly. I was working strictly with wood, which the saws had no trouble handling.

Regarding the comments about it being difficult to release bits from the collet. I learned a trick that may help and has totally alleviated any problems for me. Loosen the collet to where you can turn it with your fingers. Then when you meet resistance loosening it with your fingers, use the wrenches again to back off a little more, loosening the collet further. Voila! The bit slides right out. This is a great tip!

Now for the cons. You can't lock the zipper. I don't want to lock it to keep people from stealing... it's to keep them from borrowing without asking. But no problem I can put some grommets on BUT not everyone can. Also a couple of nice zippered pouches would be very handy for small bits n pieces.
5802	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great blades, smooth cutting, good value!
The plug that was stuck in the saw came out very easy by sticking a screwdriver in the side. This helps tremendously when cutting a few holes since you do not have to disassemble the bit with the saw like some of the other models.
(Bosch, Makita, DeWalt. Those saws are made well-enough to notice.)

I have never had a problem with this router.  It works for everything.  3.25 HP is right on the money.
First of all, I was impressed with the care that Forrest took in packaging this blade for shipment.  The box is very sturdy and reusable in case you want to ship the blade back to Forrest for sharpening. The teeth were protected by an easily removable coating that kept them razor sharp.

4139	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I debated between this set, the DW1716, and the cheaper Freud set.  The first cut with this set and I was glad I decided on one I did.  The dados it cuts are so smooths, the bottoms are flat, and I'm very impressed with the result.  This dado set comes in a durable plastic case with two snaps on the front.  Each blade is separated by a plastic spacer (these can be a little annoying at times).  The set includes (4) 1/8" chippers, (1) 3/32" chipper, and (1) 1/16" chipper.  Another reviewer mentions that the chippers aren't labeled, which would have been nice.  However it's easy enough to tell them apart without it.
9733	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Flexible, crush resistant,does not mark,works in any temperature range-25to+30 Degree C.,fittings sturdy, does not kink. Coils/uncoils easily without memory even when cold. Light color yellow easily seen,finish is suede like( not shiny) so it is not a slipping hazard.
I don't think it's the light as it does it in every socket, and the remaining original bulbs that came with the light are still going strong.  I think it's just poor quality in these bulbs.  I will soon be out of the 10 pack I bought, and will definitely be looking for another manufacturer/seller to purchase my next bulbs.

6175	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a very nice vise.  It is truly heavy duty and seems to be well made.  The template was no help as a guide for installation as the holes didn't line up on the face.  I held the base in place with Irwin clamps and used a center punch to mark the hole location.  The installation screws/bolts were included.  I also felt that the handle was a little on short side, so I cut a hardwood dowel to 16 inch length and attached the end caps that were provided.  The quick release feature is wonderfully clever and easy to use.  I attached maple faces to the vise using the threaded holes on the base and the through holes on the front

4091	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have an older Fein multi-tool. This is the blade I use the most and almost always when I don't want to make a huge mess or need to stay on my pencil line while cutting in place. I've purchased some of the generic blades but haven't found the off-set type. Fein needs to come out with this blade that can handle nails but if you're careful and switch blades that can handle a nail or two when necessary, these blades will work great for quite some time.
One tip: Get some 3/4" foam pipe insulation and keep it with the clamps.  You can cut pieces of foam to varuious lengths, and wrap them around the pipe. That'll keep your wood from getting dented or oily from contact with the pipe.

7858	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I had the larger version (10") and lost it. The other one was unavailable so I ordered this one which is listd as 8". It seems to me that it isn't just 2" shorter in overall length but is actually smaller overall. That is, the prybar is narrower and the nail puller is smaller. I can't compare them side by side b/c I lost the bigger one, but this is the feeling I am left with.

  Their is some difference of opinion as to whether it is advisable to use glue in conjunction with pocket hole screws. One camp states that since the screws hold so well when done in pairs, that you do not need to use glue. Additionally, that gives you the option of being able to remove the joint, in the event you need to resize for example, or disassemble for shipping. Additionally their argument states that since the pocket hole screw system holds so tight, any glue that is put in the seam will be squeezed out.

A nice feature is that the back has a "stand" of sorts, so you can lay the tool down securely without contaminating the bonnet.  Also nice is the twist-lock cord that helps prevent breaking the conductors at the point where it leaves the tool.  I have this problem with other tools that require a sharp bend to get them back in their cases.
The threaded ends on this hose are beveled so it makes for a great seal.  I don't know, but that may be standard for pressure hoses.  If not, then it's a great feature.
An AC adapter is available (may be purchased) if using the batteries alone is impractical.
8136	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When I first started doing remodeling work, I just picked up a cheap fiberglass hammer at home depot.  Later, after getting more into it I upgraded to an Estwing 20 oz hammer and let me tell you what a world of a difference it was.  This hammer is balanced beautifully, the grip is comfortable and absorbs a good amount of shock, and the appearance of the hammer is very nice as well.  My dad owns an Estwing hammer he had for many years and it still functions like new.  Now, after driving many thousands of nails, my hammer is also still going strong.  Many manufactures such as Kobalt, Bostich, Craftsman and various others have tried to copy the Estwing design and let me tell you, Estwing is still my favorite by far.  If you are looking for an all-steel framing hammer, there is no other hammer on the market that I have seen or used that I like better - at any price.  As long as you don't abuse it, it should last a lifetime.  I liked it so much that I began purchasing several other models, and have recommended them friends and family.  As long as their quality does not change for the worse in the future, Eswing can expect more purchases from me.  Highly recommended.

The only thing that I would want to see changed is the length of the bit needs to be shortened. After you put this bit in your drill, and then put another bit into this one, it makes the overall length too long and awkward to use. If you are using it with a drill bit, it's not as noticeable but using it with a longer screw bit, I noticed it a lot.

The sheet that the instructions come on is minuscule - and it's multi-lingual to boot.  The "drawings" are about the size of a matchbook cover - and almost as clear.  It took me almost 35 minutes to figure out how to even open this piece of equipment - and the assembly instructions might as well have been written in Martian!
This light can also be used during power outages, which are fairly frequent where we live.
3652	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this sander to sand my decks and it worked great!!  I wanted a work horse tool and I think I have one.  With about 12 hours on the motor I cannot pick up on any abnormal sounds.  I may be too critical here but I am giving the sander 4 stars because of the dust collection system.  I think one reason why the bag does not collect as much dust as it could is because the bag's wire attachment fixture does not seal the bag around the port so dust blows out of a small hole.  With that in mind, wearing a well-fitting dust mask is a must for the operator and those who may in the immediate area.  And yes, it is noisy so I strongly advise wearing hearing protection.

I finally ditched the table accessories and built my own table jig (which works surprisingly well and looks cool too). This solved the first two issues. If it is really important to have perfectly square mortises, I cut them by hand. This solves the final issue. (Note: the mortises are OK for most joinery because you have a shoulder on the tenon to hide the slightly out of square mortise.)

In summary, if you don't have any use for this size clamp with dog holes like mine, the Jorgensen is the best micro-clamp in this category on the market. If you do need to use them in 1-1/4" dog holes, then it's worth it to get the Dewalt(though they take more "fiddling with" than the ergonomic Jorgensen).

Unfortunately, Fein has an exclusive on this product and since there is no competition they can charge whatever the market will bear. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money.

7539	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased mine from Lowes. I was not impressed with it from the start. The boards that make up the top are never level with each other. They are made of some kind of Chinese bamboo plywood and two of them sag in the middle. As for clamping...  terrible. It wouldn't hold anything still. The metal frame is made fairly well but I found that mine was twisted and parts were not connected properly. After some tinkering I got most of the kinks out except the sagging top. Still, I wish I had returned it based on my first impression. All you are likely to use this for is a work table and it is a bad one at that.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2049	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The Porter-Cable 7518 and 7519 (it's fixed-speed cousin) are solid routers, but you should consider their advantages and drawbacks carefully before you buy.
The thing that frustrates me about the finished product is that I have to readjust the cooling blocks if I change the height of the guide assembly significantly.  That is, the post doesn't move perpendicular to the table.  I've tried everything to look for something out of alignment but can't find it.
9220	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Bought this to replace the cheesy little PVC hose that came with an air compressor I recently purchased. The hose seems very well built and is sturdy.  It should last a long time.  Haven't used it much but so far it performs well.
2816	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a superbly made drill.  VSR is "Variable Speed Reversing" and the grip on the drill is great for large hands.  I like the moveable front grip; it rotates 360 degrees around and a simple twist of the handle loosens it allowing it to rotate.  The chuck and chuck key are well made and overall, this is better than my Makita drills at less cost.  Generously long cord.  Tough drill.
  I would still recommend that everyone own a cordless drill, since the Milwaukee 0234-6 is a bit heavy and cumbersome to use for basic jobs ( hanging pictures, putting together toys and such).

No more messing with a chalk line and struggling to keep the circular saw from wandering when I'm ripping full size plywood sheets! This guide is the best, period. I love the "clamp from one end" feature. No C clamps are needed. The price is a little steep, but your paying for a precision piece. This tool takes the hassle out of big cutting jobs. The only problem I had was finding a place to store it (I hung it from the rafters in the garage with storage hooks). I just might have to get the 50 inch version as well. Thanks, Amazon!
5020	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The old Craftsman finally died after many years of faithful service, so I purchased the FT2000. I already own the FT1000(see separate review), so figured I might as well have a matched set.
3380	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These stops are perfect for easily cutting big crown moulding. They allow you to set only the 45 degree inside or outside angle without having to set the compound miter needed for crown moulding. It does this by propping the moulding against the fence at a 45 degree angle, and the results are excellent. The moulding doe not lay flat on your mitre saw.
They imply the tool is held together. It is not. It is in three pieces, two discs and the chain. It is not a secure one piece tool like the old one I have. The ad  for this item is misleading. The old one piece carvers are dangerous. This thing is ridiculous.
Surprisingly, the blades and chippers lost that perfect sharpness in fairly short time. To be fair, I was using a lot of ply and particle board then, and they don't seem to have gotten any duller since. While they didn't stay as sharp as my other Freud blades, they still work fine, even in my under-powered table saw. Still, that and the not perfectly smooth groove bottoms lose this set a star.

  What Bosch does with this kit, is give you three adjustable for hinge size templates for routing, that are attached, and once again adjustable. You can preset the distance between the hinges, and be sure that the templates will be perfectly upright. No off angles, which is all too often the case without this kit. Once you attach the entire apparatus, with the built in pins you rout away. Then you remove the kit from the door, attach it to the hinge jamb and rout away.

9739	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	The drill bits are connected to the hexagonal shank, and in the set I received they are significantly bent, causing the drill bit to wobble on the tip by as much as 1/2 to 1/4 of an inch.  This renders them unusable.  The packaging looked okay, but I'm not sure if they took a hit that caused them to get bent or if they came that way from the factory.  These may not be eligible for return, but suffice to say I'm disappointed with the product and I may have to try talking to DeWalt, but it's more hassle than if I had tried to find them at Home Depot.
7184	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The popular 5 piece set is what I initially bought. It includes the glue up joint bit, which is nice for gettting a lot of panels to line up properly while gluing. It also includes the door lock bit, which will turn your raised panel, into a drawer front by removing the material around the edge of the back of the door face.

No I take that back it's worth every penny it cost plus ten times more. I have recently been getting into the art of segmented bowl turning on my Lathe. This protractor is amazing for helping me to mark the exact angle needed for each piece to match perfectly. The only other way to get as accurate of angle is to maybe use a two or three foot protractor and then you might be as close as this 6 inch tool is. I can now make accurate setup jigs in just minutes and at pretty much any angle I might ever need.
8869	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What fine craftsmanship and precision!  The sort of tool one is proud to own.  I totally admire it.  Buy it if you want the best.  Nevertheless, Empire or Stanley will work fine if you just want functionality and would rather spend your money on lattes.
I'm knocking a start for safety.  I don't like that the switch is on the top of the router.  The top is proud of the switch, so if you set the router upside down, it won't hit the switch.  Still I see our carpenters often holding the router against themselves as the use the wrenches to tight the router bits in place.  I can't help picturing their bellies somehow hitting the switch and sending parts flying.  With good safety practices those parts will be wrenches and not finger tips.
 The polish did gleam like the picture, like so shiny a flash would only capture that crazy reflection you get off a clean windshield on a summer day.  And as for the stickers?  Peeled them off with my nails and the glue, which is pesky, comes RIGHT OFF with Rem Oil and a cotton patch in seconds.  It's a teflon bedded aerosol gun oil sold at Walmart.  No muss, no fuss, only needed one cotton patch to clean all three stickers off.
On the plus side, my saw took a 20foot nosedive and suffered no damage...despite landing right on the corner of the foot, it's still true and cuts great.

6047	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was concerned that they might not provide enough pressure and the material would slip out of them, but that is definitely not the case.  These are very much a heavy duty grip -- not suitable for items than might be deformed by pressure -- and the typical Irwin yellow tips that rotate to compensate for angle are a plus.
I bought my first Porter-Cable router when my trusty 25+ y.o. Craftsman finally bit the dust. I figured routers were pretty simple devices and they are all generally the same; the same bits that fit my Craftsman would fit the Porter-Cable. Wrong. I tried to use a 3/4" round-over bit. The bit would not fit the hole in the stock base plate. I (and a lot of others) couldn't believe Porter-Cable would make their classic router without the capability to accept any non-pro grade bit. I had two different sized collets so why not two base plates?

6710	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Bot 3 sets Lechmere closeout 10 years ago. Use sporadically and have experience that batteries last 4 years plus/minus. Buy a new one each year, keep 3-4 going. Inside batt are two industrial "C" Ni-Cads - older ones develop memory. To utilize best, discharge to 5% remain, then full. Not user replaceable. The torgue is enough to twist the unit out of a strong grip, but they are best for light/medium assembling, not all day heavy duty

(I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery, doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent, but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer.
4258	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	What a great saw!  Take advantage of what Jet has to offer here.  This is basically a Powermatic saw, for about $[money] less!  I have to admit that the legs for my extension table arrived bent from shipping, but the service team at Amazon took care of me and shipped a new pair that arrived within the week.  Setup of the saw was fairly easy, if a bit time consuming.  Once I got it put together though, it ran very smoothly.  Consider ordering a zero-clearance throat plate, I think it's worth the little bit extra you might spend.  I've got no bones about this saw, it's really a great tool.
  I've filled up a 33 gallon trash can three times and haven't had to empty the dust bags on my Jet vacuum yet.
This blade has done nothing but impress.  Easily 200 trim cuts on landscape pavers, plus some ceramic tile work, and still works really well.  Would buy another in a minute when this finally wears out...

3867	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've run this dado set through just about every material there is and it  produces sharp sidewalls and flat bottoms every time. The blades run true  and with about 150 lineal feet of material run through, the teeth are still  sharp. Just remember to clean the resin or glue residue from the cavity  behind each tooth as it builds up easily and starts to burn the work piece.  I have a Jet contractor's saw with the 1.5 hp motor. The dado insert you  can order from Jet will only accomodate a 6" dado set. You will have  to use a zero clearance insert to make your own, otherwise you can use the  metal one from Jet and limit the depth of cut to about 1 1/4". Kind of  defeats the purpose of the 8" blade. Also these blades are heavy and  if you use the entire stack, the 1.5 hp motor does not have enough power to  cut a dado to more than 3/4". You will have to make more than one pass  to cut one deeper effectively.
2881	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I am posting because the product desription is not correct. Otherwise, it does appear as advertised.

Cons
4620	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I learned the hard way, but this blade is not actually 10", it's undersized by 3/16 of an inch. What that means on a sliding miter saw(or at least my saw) is it won't cut thru a 2x4 without moving the saw fence toward the user AND using the slide.  Every saw I've ever used will cut through a 2x4 just by bringing the blade down while the slide is locked. I called Freud and they admit the blade is "metric" and slightly undersized but have never heard of the situation I described.  Oh well, returned the blade.
9654	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is an awesome tool for frustrated artists.  Currently using it to rough out bowls from green Basswood.  Putting the disk on is annoying.  It's two big washers and a loop of chain so it keeps falling apart.  If you are using a variety of grinder tools just buy a second $25 grinder and leave it on.  It is a chainsaw tool so a disaster waiting to happen.  Wear protective gear and keep in mind the location of your important parts.  I believe there is a double chain version which I'll purchase next.  Nice complement to a chainsaw for artistry.  Not sure if 'grinder art' qualifies as 'chainsaw art.'

If you do mostly hand-held operations, you might want to consider something lighter. Both Bosch and DeWalt make good routers in that range. Of course, Festool is an option if money is no object. Personally, I think this is a bargain compared to what they ask for those Teutonic tools.
I will say that when setting up the dado stack you must be VERY careful to have every blade/spacer/shim flat next each other.  The slightest gap will cause your stack to rotate out of round and also give you poor cuts.  I find that on the R4512 saw I am not able to use the outer washer when the stack is built to 3/4".  There are 2 threads or so coming through the nut, so it is on securely and safely.
and are too expensive as well

5721	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a very good Table-Top Router Table. It has 2 different aluminum tracks on the table top and one aluminum track on the fence for attachments (featherboard, etc...). The table is made of 12 ply plywood. Along with a fully height adjustable router plate and plate holes for the most common routers (and a template to add the more obscure ones), this router was up and running in less than an hour, making red oak trim like the pros. Rubber feet round out an excellent addition to my tool inventory.
Still working just fine after all this time.
2295	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Normally I love Dewalt tools but this thing is worthless. Imagine the light produced by a $2 flashlight you buy at a grocery store, and from an 18 volt lithum battery? I ended up just throwing it in the garbage.
499	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This may be enough light if you attach it to the item you're reading, assuming its not a thick book, and the light is 6-8" from the reading surface.  But then its a hassle every time you want to turn the page.  Its too dim for me at 18-24" inches from the reading surface, for example, attached it to a bed board behind you.  The LED light is very bluish.
Also, Amazon did a great job getting this to me, even arriving ahead of schedule. The container was clean and undamaged as well as the tool itself.
You can never have enough clamps.  Buy these for your next project.

  Update: Fine Woodworking magazine did a review in their September/October 2001 issue and out of 12 jointers, DeWalt had the worst score for biscuits out of parallel.  Exact quote was, "although I can live with 0.017 in. out of parallel, biscuit joints assemble with less fuss when the number is 0.007 in. or lower."  Lamello Top 20 came in at 0.000 and Makita came in at 0.001. The Porter came in at 0.005.  They liked Lamello, Porter, Makita, and the DeWalt even after what they found.  Being a casual user, I think I will consider the Makita because of the cost savings.

7480	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	There isn't much to these clamps and thats what makes them so darn useful. It seems like the race is on to see who can build a better clamp. Perhaps pipe clamps are like the mouse trap so called improvements have been made. But are they really better? granted there are some nice clamps out there but don't overlook the simplicity of the jorgenson. It's tried true and timeless not to mention very inexpensive. I choose to use galvenized pipe instead of black it tends to be cheaper and won't rust up and stain your project. Now get out there and clamp something.
7571	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this model at a department store last summer, when I began painting my 60 year old, wooden sided home. I wanted a power tool to help take some of the work out of the surface prep job. I scraping by hand, and followed up by using the sander to smooth the surface. It worked wonders, producing a paper smooth finish on the bare wood and old paint that remained. Being so lightweight, it was a pleasure to use, especially up on the ladder. Actually, it made the job fun. This Makita sander has plenty of power. It did not bog down, and the dust bag is a great feature. I can't wait to use it in the county 4H youth summer camp woodworking class I teach every year. One point I must make, however; I used a genaric brand hook and loop type sanding pads. They did a great job, but after a time, the fabric side of the pads would fray before the sanding side was used up, and the pad would come off during use, sailing away like a Frisbee. This happened several times. So, beware!!  Next time, I'll use genuine Makita brand sanding pads.

If you have drywall to do, and you don't have a drywall gun you are wasting time. It is worth the money.
When you replace the blades, you are going to notice an immediate difference. The new blades are exceptionally sharp. The planer will make a lot less noise, and the wood will slide through easily. This goes for very wide planks of very hard woods. The two hardest woods I have planed are bubinga (used for guitar backs) and olivewood. Both are dense, hard, and heavy. A 12" wide board seems to glide through with a new blade.

"Check to see what the specifications are for dados on your machine. Many manufacturers limit the diameter of the dado to 6" while others allow 8" but may limit the width of cut. If your machine is rated for a 6" or 8" stacked dado, then there is the consideration of the arbor nut size, inside flange diameter, and arbor length.  Unfortunately there are too many saws for us to keep a list of what these specifications are for every machine and be able to keep it up to date with changes made by the manufacturers, but with some quick measurements you can determine if your saw is capable of running the Dial-A-Width.

7992	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Stanley used to make a good plane.  In fact, I bought this plane as an addition to a Stanley block plane I have owned for 30 years, which has given excellent service all that time.  This plane, however, is a piece of junk.  The casting was so poorly done that the sole of the plane was not flat, and spurs left over from the casting that had not been machined off prevented the plan from nesting in the plane body so that the blade had adequate throat clearance.  I sent it back to Stanley for a refund and bought a competitor's plane.
Good luck and have fun.

I have a cover on my Kindle, but this still fits over it even with the front cover flipped to the back with the clamp stretched out almost to the max. But it still fits, so no complaints there. The clamp can't be pushed all the way down or else it impedes on my reading space, but even with it having a slight gap at the top it's still secured well. It doesn't move around or anything. The clamp spring is very tight and sturdy. The clamp itself is a little bulky and heavy, but it's because it takes AAA batteries. I compared this to others that were lighter, but took specialty batteries and decided that I'd rather have a little bigger of a light than have to go find a weird battery.  The adjustable arm on the light is longer than what is necessary for my Kindle, but it's nice to have a lot of space for adjusting, it's easy to get it in just the right pace to get a good amount of light without a glare. The light itself is bright! You push the button once and 2 lights come on, push again and 1 turns off and push again and they all turn off. I have only ever needed one light on, even when it's pitch black.

I chose this one over the variable speed model because of so-so reviews I'd read for the other one. I did prefer the ergonomics of the variable speed model better and am reminded of this every time I use it. This one is a bit uncomfortable to grab from the top even though I have fairly large hands. It's fine when I wrap around the middle, but I'd like the option.

3655	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I find it funny that people gave this bad reviews because they got saw dust thrown in their face. It comes with a bag to use. I didn't like the bag so I decided to attach my shop vac to it and to my disappointment, it doesn't fit. I tried several different adapters and finally headed to Lowe's plumbing section and bought a 1" compression fitting that fits on the sander and my shop vac. It's perfect and no saw dust. See attached picture.
That does not mean these are the one-and-only solution for all rip cuts. There is no such thing. Instead, I suggest we view these as an addition to a collection of jigs. Considering their robust design and manufacture, the ease of set-up, and how quickly you can make multiple thin rips, these are actually a time-saver for that task. They are a bargain too since they are only $25 bucks a piece for real metal that is Made in the USA. I don't know of any one-time insurance premiums that low!

The GOOD:
Again, for one month of 6 day a week use it was GREAT but it dulled much too quickly - regardless of the price (and yes, I did clean and treat the blade at the end of each day).  So, whyh pay the price unless it comes with free sharpening and a loner blade for the time it spends "away" every four or five weeks.
1264	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Fine.
5809	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have this hooked to a Sears Shop Wet/Dry Vacuum.  As others have noted, the attachment size is a little "non-standard", probably due to the fact that the hose fits over the tools instead of sliding in them.  Nonetheless, the hose and swivel are easy to use and the material makes for very efficient pickup.  I also like the claw and crevice nozzle.  They are a bit small for small spaces in my small car, but they are great for going over floors, seats, and jobsite pickup.  Definitely recommended over the stock hose that comes with most shop & wet/dry vacs.

Finally, if you're going to mount this router in a table (and you probably should), take a few minutes to file off the template guide tabs so that the machine can accommodate large panel-raising bits.

9480	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This has been a great investment.  The hose is so much more flexible, lays flat, and seems rugged.  I've been using it while building my basement and have been happy with it thus far.  I assumed it wouldn't twist on itself as much but it still has the characteristic twist when unraveled at least initially.  It is however so much better than the PVC style hose that came with the unit.  I used thread seal paste for the connection points at the ends and no leaks are audible and the system holds pressure during off time.  Overall I am very pleased with the units performance.

4873	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I can't believe how much I've used this and how I went so long without a belt sander in general. I've flattened rough lumber with it, fine tuned tight fitting doors, and I even use it to get a faster, flatter, cleaner cut rather than using a saw to trim down a board end (no chance of splintering the wood).
i had to glue two strips of 1 1/2 x 3/4 maple together and then cut them to length and width of my dewalt chop saw. i got the dimensions by balancing the corner brackets on the table saw legs while it was still upside down in the box and measuring the distances with a scrap of wood.
The second problem is the router continually locks the bits in the collet.  I tried every lubricant imaginable without success.  Once the bit is locked in, plan on keeping it in place for a while, a very long while.  I have been forced to use pliers to pry the bits out. The freezing complaint is repeated numerous times by other users.  I incorrectly assumed Porter Cable (PC) would have resolved this by the time of my purchase.
I have never been disappointed with a Bosh tool.  This is no exception.

3737	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Not sure why some reviewers claim that the DW160V doesn't reverse or have variable speed, but it certainly does.  The size and torque are good, and Dewalt has done a nice job of keeping the chuck short.  Those who complain about a lack of a keyless chuck might want to take a look at the chuck size for those, which all I've seen are significant larger than this drill's compact chuck.  The paddle control seemed strange at first, but then after using the drill it worked quite naturally, allowing me to keep the drill in precise alignment while ramping up the speed.  As to those who claim issues with the paddle being pressed when the drill is set down, one just has to pay attention and all is well.

Though it's tough to get square and set, once you do it doesn't move much.  The parts are all solidly made and the fit and finish is just fine.  Comes with a nice assortment of bits too.  I will say that the chisels "cooked" (turned blue) pretty quick, but that may have been my own mistake.
  Tape the wrench in its hole or you will need replacement soon.
6344	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	So much oozed out of the joint I was gluing that maybe there was nothing left.  It only held a chair arm in place for a couple of days.
6840	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As a handyman, I often have to work on things near the ceiling or otherwise just a little higher than I can reach, so a two-foot ladder is just right.
5105	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been building up my home shop for years and have purchased a good deal of the tools in it from Amazon. I depend on the reviews left here to determine whether I should buy a certain item or not. I read ALL the reviews before I buy. Sometimes there are radically different reviews on the same product from different people that all sound like they know what they are talking about, though, so you just have to trust the overall rating. Lately, I have noticed that my projects seem less perfect than I think they should so I started looking to nicer tools. Without doubt, those nicer tools have made a difference in my work and I just wanted to tell any other woodworkers out there moving past the novice level that its ok to skimp on certain things, the things you can modify or may not use that often, but on certain tools, you just shouldn't... I recently decided that I didn't like the tearout that I always get crosscutting plywood on the table saw and cutting ANYTHING on the compound miter, radial arm, or small circular saw. They were all the original blades that came with the tools and were long in the tooth - besides being junk in the first place. The radial arm blade I replaced with a Freud from Home Depot (I was there, it was impulse). I liked it very much and it was at that point that I decided that I should replace the table saw and miter saw and also my little 6" circular saw. Having had such good luck with the Freud, I was happy that I was not going to have to spend $100 on every blade. I replaced the 6" saw blade next with a Freud. As soon as it arrived, I ran it through a few cuts and although it was better than the stock blade, it was not at all what I was hoping for. That was one of those reviews where some people said they hated it and some loved it. Next I started looking at replacing the compound miter blade, also with a Freud, that again had the same mixed reviews sparking a feeling of unease. I was also looking to replace the table saw blade at the same time so ran across this model. I went back and forth between the WWII and a Freud combination blade, read the reviews, reread the reviews, trying to ken whether I could really justify spending this much more. How could they be that much different??? Well, I ordered the Freud LU91M010 (for the chop saw) and the Forrest WWII and now I understand. The Freud cuts and cuts smoothly. It's ok. It still does leave some tearout. The WWII, though. That is money well spent. I put it through its paces and it impressed me every time. It does everything that the other reviewers say. It is smooth. It is silent. It left no tearout in anything I ran through it (birch ply, mahog ply, maple, soft pine, red oak). I did not purchase the stabilizer. I am glad I decided to allow myself to spend the extra money. I will not be so quick to look at Freud blades now, as 2 out of 3 that I purchased did not perform as they should and $50 is still not nothing.
712	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great....thanks
7461	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This thing is not very strong. I clamped a bench block to do some Armorer work  very tightly and when I got done the work table was bent. This thing is more for the hobbyist or light work around the house as long as you don't push it too hard. Do not expect to mount a vice on this thing or do more than some light duty wood working. It was great for cutting 2X6" boards for the deck and garage work. For holding something to work on it forget it .
6207	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I got this about a month ago and took it with me to HD and L's to find a matching trash can. The jet unit seems to be better made and more rigid then other dust separator units I had looked at. It has 2 foam gaskets, one on the outer edge and one about 2 1/2 to 3 inches from the edge. I found that the inner gasket fit the 30 gallon Rubbermaid Brute plastic container with about 3 inches of overhang all around. I tried the 44 gallon Brute container and voila! It fit perfectly on the outer gasket with no overhang. I bought the 44 gallon container with the optional wheeled dolly, connected it to my Delta 50-760 1 micron collector and now have what I think is the perfect 2-stage home-shop dust collection system.
I checked the the line up of the blade and it checked out okay but the fixed shoe does not line up with the housing,
It is a very heavy belt sander which is good is sanding down on something but a little unwieldy when sanding a vertical surface.

1969	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is an amazing router, perfect for mounting in a table which is what I bought it for. It has plenty of power for the big bits and all the speeds. I researched the reviews of others on here for a few different brands and this one seemed to have the best feedback. Not disappointed. Very happy with my purchase.
I combined these with a 3 way touch dimmer, and everything is working great. Lots of heat on high, but medium brightness is fine for the most part. Anyway, good company, great price (1/4 of the local HD).
6307	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I went out and bought a 12" 512QC Quick-Grip Bar clamp/spreader just  a few days ago and felt I should have bought it a long time ago. I can do  most of the clamping with one hand now. I am not a professional but this  tool let me do my work much x faster. The grip is very strong. In one click  you can loosen it and the other handle on top tightens it. The Rubber grips  protects wood from being damaged. You don't need to insert anything between  wood and the grip. I want to buy the bigger length ones when the need  arise. Also this is very lightweight and strong. I think every wood working  enthusiast or pro should have it

4313	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I brought the new 1618EVS to the job and after routing D pine for all togeather maybe 3 hrs. (NOT continuous running time) I smoked the motor.  After a long conversation with the authorized tool service center I sent it in for a complete motor rebuild.  They assured me it would come back assembled to tighter specs. than what it was manufactured at.  I was skeptical that it would be returned to me in any decent workable condition yet two years later I'm still milling trim with it.  However I'm still waiting for that day, in the middle of some job, where it will start spewing smoke out of the motor housing again.

I took the blade off the saw that came with it and installed this Forrest blade, and what a difference it made in quality. I took a piece of clear white pine as a test, and the edge was as smooth as glass. At the jobsite ripping down 3/4 red oak, the edge was the same.

All are now dead. I took a chance on "Mighty Bright 47017 Recharge Book Light"

 It is great for setting up any kind of saw. All of these things can be done with a square, bevel gauge, and protractor, but not with the ease, time savings, and micro accuracy of the Bosch. (Not that we need a tenth of a degree to cut a molding.)

923	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	We got new bathroom lamps that came with eight 40 Watt halogen bulbs just like these. These were entirely too bright and almost required sunglasses when entering the bathroom (which is a smallish cookie-cutter size 2nd bathroom with a tub, a toilet and a sink, it is not a larger master bath). While the light the 40 W bulbs emitted was per se pleasant and not cold, they felt like stage lights rather than normal bathroom lights - not good nor comfy. We quickly decided we needed lower wattage bulbs.
The light fixtures are at the top of the 6'5" cabinet. The ceramic bases in the light fixtures face the back of the cabinet making insertation rather diffucult. In the end everything worked out fantastic. THANK YOU AMAZON.

Fortunately, a few years ago, I discovered rubber hoses.  This GoodYear hose is as good as any I've used.  It rolls out nice and straight, yet still coils in a nice organized roll.  It's also easy to just pull a couple of loops off or to stretch it out to the full 50 feet.  The yellow color helps keep me from tripping over it or running over it.
I was  cutting a bunch of dados last night in 3/4" birch plywood and there  was absolutely no splintering or tearout.  I was using a shop made plywood  insert in my Jet table saw that was probably 3/64" below the cast iron  table.  In other words, it was a not-quite-zero-clearance insert and still  no problems.

I did quite a lot of research so I was aware the old Hitachis are pretty universally well-liked compared to their more value-minded predecessors but I didn't think I was likely to find one for a decent price so when I saw one of these new for the price of a good 2.5 combo kit, I jumped on it.

1496	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect! I just replaced the 4 halogen bulbs in my range hood with a 5-pack of these. These have much better spread / diffusion than the halogens so the area under the range hood is considerably more even. They also drop the electricity usage from 80W (20Wx4) to just 7.2W (1.8Wx4) for a 90% reduction in energy usage. Also, unlike the halogens, these LEDs don't put off a HUGE amount of heat. They're likely to last much longer than the halogen's and now I've got a spare.

6806	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	(Added 06/26/09) I forgot to mention that when I received the ladder, it had a dent in one of the side rails.  I placed the ladder on a flat surface, took a 1-1/4" pipe, placed it firmly against (and as squarely as possible) the dent and banged the other end with a short handled 5lb sledge hammer.  Two hits and it was as good as new...

It made a great insert for this blade set.  Then changed the blade break and removed the riving knife.  Finally  I used blades and all chippers to produce several 1/4 inch tenons in solid cherry.  The blade set ran straight and true.  No vibration, no burn, and very little "cleaning" (sanding and chisel work) on the tenons.  I have used a Freud set.

7570	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above, most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders.

I had replace it with cheaper quality and lower priced alternatives, as the distributor I dealt with had gone out of buisness and I just couldn't find it anywhere. This was a tool that I really was disappointed to have to live without. I used to attach thousands upon thousands of wires to terminal strips, electrical components,etc. This tool held up to the rigors of the Electrical trade and I had put it through it's paces almost everyday with never a problem.

It can cut a 2X but cutting panels is this thing's forte.  With the small blade you have to focus a little more to keep cuts straight (harder than with a 7.25" blade saw) but the guide seems accurate enough and with a little practice cutting panels it has become an old friend.

They're made in America (when American made hammers are difficult to find in 2017) and it shows spectacularaly in the products, especially when compared to other brands which are mostly Chinese junk these days. I have owned 6 or 7 Estwings of this type over the years and the quality has either stayed the same or gotten better. My father has probably 15 Eastwings, and I've used pretty much every make and model of hammer you are likely to encounter, so I know a little about the consistiency of the quality.

I do have two complaints: 1. It shreds the wood pretty good on the exit side. The entrance side was fine. So beware, if appearance wood, be prepared for some repair. 2. The last part of the cut seemed to wander a bit. Don't really know why- I never used more than half the blade in any cut.

8457	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Bosch DWM40L has saved me a lot of time on even the simple angles. I bought it for setting up angle cuts on my Dewalt sliding miter saw and now using it for all angle cuts.  While installing an angled facia board on a roof peak, I slid the Bosch DWM40L into the slope of the roof line, divided by 2 and cut a perfect fitting joint without trial and error!!
3283	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This mobile base lifts my radial arm saw about 1/4".  My garage floor is not perfectly flat so when I move the saw it bottoms out.  I normally really like Delta tools but this is very disappointing.
Then, I opened the box for the rails, and found that (1) there was no hardware; (2) no directions; and (3) the tape was fastened on the rail crooked.  I went back to the store where I bought it, and the owner told me that Jet has some problems with hardware.  In fact, it seems that other customers have been returning Jet saws for this very reason.  I had to wait a week for another rail set.  Finally, it came in, and I took the new rail set home.  But this time, I found that the hardware WAS THE WRONG SIZE!!!!  Back to the store again for another rail set.  I get home, and this time, I decided to take a look at the fence, just to check it out, and I find a gaping crack right along one of the solder areas.  Irate, I open the rails again, just to check, and again, NO HARDWARE!!!!!

I haven't had the problem getting it sharpened as one reviewer has. I routinely take all new blades, bits, and cutters in to my local saw shop before I use them. I learned the hard way, new doesn't mean sharp. Their only comment was that it was a nicely balanced unit and has a good amount of carbide. Of course this shop has been in the same location for over 75 years, so they have probably seen it all.
3494	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This drill's trigger takes up 3/4 of the handle and when the drill binds up while drilling, your first reaction is to take your finger off the trigger. Too bad you gotta take three fingers off of the trigger on this particular model! This means that your trying to fight the torque with only your pinky and thumb gripping the handle! Great power but not worth a jammed wrist. I'm staying with Milwaukee brand, just not this model.
  I couldn't figure out how they mounted from the pictures, but they attach across the top of your fence. The yellow plastic-rubber like bumpers extend out and press down on your work and are adjustable thanks to the spring loaded tensioner. So you can fine tune them for different size stock thicknesses.
Each attachment, easily kept available and stored when you can find it, works with each specific project.  Whether it is a dovetail, dado, bisquit spline, pinpoint or just joining two boards together, this set gets the job done.

5871	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good quality, holds well...
It does need a slot cut out for the splitter as well as the blade, but it's simple enough to do.  This is a very effective and durable insert.  It's nearly identical to the proprietary insert that Sears sells for this saw for about 25% more.  I couldn't ask for much more.
The installation was very simple and easy, took about 15 minutes, and most of that was actually reading the directions.  Adjustment is also very simple.  The bearings adjust forward/backward and side to side, so each blade setup can be easliy accomplished with a simple allen wrench.

The Woodstock DC Separator lets you collect and empty in a 30 gallon garbage can, very easy to remove the lid and empty the can.

7045	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Some might disagree on whether or not you need a pad for pipe clamps. I'm sure we can all agree that pipe clamps are capable of putting down some serious pressure. Even on hardwoods you are going to get a divot in the edge of your workpiece if you clamp too hard. These rubber pads help greatly in reducing that. A lot of times it doesn't really matter because you make your piece over size and trim it down later anyway. However, I feel a lot better having good edges to my work in case of a drop or damage to part of the piece that needs to be cut off. Might have to pick up another set of these, but already got 2 packs so I should be set for a while.
Detailed maps and descriptions allow you to trace the entire canal, as much as is possible, from Phillipsburg to Jersey City.  It is broken down in sections that can easily be covered in a series of day trips.
I've been happiest with this saw since a carbide blade was installed some years ago.  Although this is a terrific TRIM saw, I wouldn't recommend it for the ONLY circular saw in your toolbox.  This is because maximum cutting depths are too shallow for 2x4s and other thicker stock, and because it cuts much slower (on heavy stock) than a bigger, more powerful, saw.  It is a well-designed, professional grade tool.

To install the unit, you'll need some wrenches (socket, adjustable, etc) of the usual sizes, both metric and fractional inch hex keys (Allen wrenches) of various sizes including the somewhat unusual 8mm size, and (if using an extension table to the right of the blade) a 9/64" drill (I got by with a 1/8" drill).  A square and steel ruler are useful for adjusting the splitter.

Apply light pressure into wood or sheet rock or the clutch will not disengage ( deep hole results ). Always test on scrap before using first time - the adjustment collar will provide consistent, satisfactory results with your increased familiarity with this screwdriver. When screwed in to desired depth, unit chatters as though the bit is spinning on the screw head. It's OK, that's just the clutch releasing at the desired torque needed to sink the screw to the desired depth. Materials of different densities require different collar settings.

That's the band saw. I have a healthy FEAR of that thing. This fence fits well and works even better. I haven't lost my fear of Mr. Band Saw, but now I can use a push stick, a ten foot push stick. My life and my shop are safer because I have a fence.
It's also not blazing fast. This is typical of the more traditional 1/2" drills which are used primarily on tougher materials where a slower speed is desirable. It's not slow like a subcompact but some people want those 1/4" and under holes bored as close to instantaneously as possible.
For being a mini bar clamp, this item has the ability to create incredible pressure when holding things together. I recommend this product, and suggest that you don't get one of the 'no name' cheap products available.  I recommend this product to others and I'm confident it will meet your expectations.

I picked up this dado set after having purchased its smaller brother (Freud SD506)in recent months. I needed this set as, the smaller 6" set would not allow me to cut out the notches in the 4x4 material that I was working with. Just as the smaller 6" set, it performed flawlessly!! There are a LOT of dado sets out there in the world folks BUT, what separates the men from the boys is, that THIS SET will cut FLAT bottomed and SQUARE dados!! Don't be fooled by cheaper sets, you won't be happy with them when your stock is ruined by their poor quaily.

9089	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The nailer is the greatest. I use it all the time whenever I have something to nail  and I love it. I tend not to use it on a regular basis so I have found that it is safer and better if you remove the fuel cell. The fuel cells tend to loose gas if left in the gun for long periods of time. I purchased the Paslode, the generation before this one and I found the gas cartridges seemed to last a lot longer. I guess this is the way things usually go when a company wants to sell more of something.  Generally when I go to use it, the battery is always low on charge, so I need to charge it up. I like the gun the most because it doesn't move the material that you are nailing, like hitting with a hammer does. Remodeling is a snap. One problem I have noticed is the nails don't stay in the wood that well. It could be that they are not long enough or the coating is not that good. Overall I wouldn't ever be without my Pasload.
6902	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Every plumber has a few pipe wrenches and at least one 12"-14"  but every handyman should have at least one pipe wrench and so I bought this one at my local BORG. This tool is beefy & solid but doesn't weigh a ton. I keep a plumbing kit in a Milwaukee bucket organizer that stays inside my truck and every now & then a tool will rust a bit despite my occassional WD40'ing them, but this one's steel parts have remained  rust free. Hard gripping rows of teeth w/ the perfect play to lock down the work. I don't understand why pipe wrenches in general don't come w/ a tough plastic or rubber gripping surface the way some adjustable pliers & wrenches do. To sum up, this is a tool made for serious work and I'll have it for a looong time.
2518	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Hands down this is amazing!!! Great product at a great price. Purchased for dad for a replacement as his quit working. He loves it. Will probably buy one for me now.
  It was pretty straight forward and the instructions were clear.  Just a couple of things I should mention.  The clear plastic blade shields slip over a steel pin and are held by allen head set screws.  It seemed that they required a tiny allen wrench. I mean really really tiny.  Smaller than any I had ever seen before.  I am embarassed to admit that I puzzled over this for a full 15 minutes before I figured out that the set screws had been installed backwards at the factory - on BOTH guard shields.  Simple matter to unscrew them and put them in right. Sheesh!

4110	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	As always you can rely on genuine Fein products,they never let me down.
Of the 8-1/4" blades I found online, many have a 1" diameter hole that is a poor match for this saw's 5/8" diameter arbor. I hate using the arbor adapter rings, but if you plan to buy this saw you might want to consider buying a few of them out of necessity. The one I bought was too thick compared to the diamond cutting blade I was using, so the arbor clamp disk would not contact the side of the blade, and I had to grind the adapter down to make it thinner before I could use it. I have seen some saws that have arbor pieces that allow multiple sizes of center holes in different blades to be used, but DeWalt has not done this with the DW384. I called DeWalt customer service and they confirmed that they do not have alternate arbor pieces for different diameter blade holes.

I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw. It's outstanding to operate. Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do. I like the extra long air hose on the saw; it does a nice job of keeping the work area clear of dust when cutting and it adjusts easily. This saw also runs very smoothly and quite. If you enjoy doing fret work or making small detail cuts this is the saw to have.

2328	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	While this trimmer might be fine for quick roundovers and the like, it lacks the refinement and precision necessary for fine woodworking and production work. Careful observers will notice that the base and motor are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. There is too much slop in the height adjustment mechanism and set knob. Too, the base itself is not perfectly flat (place a sheet of 400 grit sandpaper on a flat table and run the base plate over it a few times. High and low spots will quickly become apparent.) All in all, the 7310 is very underwhelming in its quality and precision. As far as the "Rotozip" style trimmers go, the DeWalt and Bosch models offer better quality and refinement then this PC, though they, too, suffer from some of the same problems.
4144	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This rip fence fits fine on our circular saw.  The screw for tightening it down comes included.  The only negative thing I could say about this fence is that it does not fit squarely in the notch molded into the saw's case.  It extends just a bit further than the slot.  The case still closes fine.  The extra material that sticks out probably makes it easier to pull it out of the case.  Otherwise.  I would recommend this product
3300	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I guess its my fault, I bought a new DeWalt scroll saw and figured since the saw got 4 and 5 star reviews the light was safe to buy. I was wrong. I attached this light to my saw and it will not hold its position. There are reviews going back all the way to 2006 with this issue and DeWalt still has not corrected the problem, I am losing faith in the company named DeWalt, it's bad enough they are being ran by the same people who run Black and Recker, but DeWalt had always seemed to build a quality product, but since they made Porter Cable a second or third tier tool company it seems DeWalt may be on the same path as PC is on. It's a shame, too few real companies own too many tool company names. They have eliminated their competition by buying them up and keeping their name, so today you have 5 or 6 tool lines being built in the same factory coming down the same Chinese assembly line. They seem to have sacrificed quality and workmanship to save a buck or two so they can sell their tools in the Big Box stores. DeWalt and Porter Cable use to be top of the line tool companies, a tool you could buy for a little extra cash but would last forever, not anymore.

2958	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Power outages are not uncommon in this area and we needed a reliable source of light other than candles or standard rechargeable flashlights.  This light fits the bill.  It is nice and bright and the swivel head is very convenient.  It is also very useful for working in crawl spaces instead of dragging in one of the shop lights with the long cord and light bulb.  This light does not come with a battery pack but if you have any other Dewalt tools powered by 18v NiCa battery, they are all interchangeable.

Happy Dewalt is still making this saw and Amazon has the best deal. I ordered a new one.

Similar to comments in other reviews, I was a bit surprised by the lack of intensity of the light though -- it might be just a tad brighter than your typical 2-D cell non-LCD flashlight.  Maybe I have become spoiled by all of the CREE LCDs flooding the market these days, but I did expect a brighter, whiter light.

4905	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a DeWalt model DW703 cross cut saw. I broke the original bag when moving the saw. So I bought this one as a replacement. Works just like the original one. I would estimate that 75% of the dust is collected. And what is not put in the bag winds up as a neat pile on the floor - rather than being blown at random around the room if you do not use any bag.

2012	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Before I tell you why I do not like this router I guess I should first say that I am a huge fan of porter cable products. I have two of their H/L 8 hole orbital sanders, there older model two base router kit, two belt sanders and their 5" orbital 1/4" right angle sander. I have used these products a lot and they have not let me down. So, after my old and discontinued Sears Craftsman Professional 3 1/2 hp plunge router was dying I decided after a lot of research to buy this router. I mainly use these routers in tables that I have built with products from Rockler. I decided on this style instead of the Bosch because I was tired of dealing with a plunge style router (even though you can dissengage the mechanisim on Bosch's) and wanted to go with the twist style like my 1 1/2 hp porter cable router. First impressions when I received it was how heavy and solid it felt. I didn't like the bolt design to unlock and lock the router but I was okay with it initially. Besides the bolt I also noticed that the speed selection switch seemed a little too loose for my liking. Nothing of a big concern, but wished it had a difinitive clisk on each speed (maybe too picky). Now I had it in my router table and was using it to make 48 42" high raised panel doors for a customer. The rails and stiles were poplar and the panels were MDF. My bits were Freuds and the panel raising bit had an undercutter. I bought two of these. The rails and stiles went well, but I did notice how the motor would wind up and down when the wood was going through the bit. No issues other than that for this part, but it went down hill from there. When using the panel raising bit I chose to make three pasess at the proper speed so I would not tax the motor too much. I had dust collection above and below the router at all times, especially with MDF. About 1/3 into the panel bits the router was sounding rough. Every 8 panels I would let the router cool down and I would vacumn out and around the router, but after the second batch of panels it sounded like the bearings were getting rougher. Needless to say when I finished the next day my new router was sounding bad. I finished the job and was finished with the router. Under warranty, it is now being fixed at my local PC dealer. I called amazon and since it is past the 30day policy they would only refund me 80% of the total bill. I am very bummed out about this and hopefully I just got a lemon, but my old router served me for 14 years of light to moderate use and never had a motor problem. Oh well, I have to wait and see from here.
Overall I believe there is no better saw on the market.  Whether you are a weekend warrior or a proffessional builder this is the saw to own and most in the industry agree, just look at the number of these saws on any jobsite.
9500	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I like it because it is made out of brass and my old one is made out of alloy. It corroded real bad and the replacement is a plus.
I'm going through our 110v lights now and will hopefully be getting more of the 12v ones to put in their place.  If I recall correctly CB sells these also but the same day I ordered and noticed the error requesting that the order be changed to 12v lights (over 300dollars worth) but they said that it could not be done even thought they hadn't shipped yet.  no bigee really.
4786	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I did a lot of research and many people complained about "the tolerances" or the machines being "off" by a micro millimeter.  Here is my experience: I'm a dowel guy, but i recently purchased this tool to speed things up that don't need the strength of a dowel.  I'm quite happy with it.  There are some big advantages in assembly of cabinetry to have a plate jointer!  When you place a biscuit, you have a little play to work with so even if the machine were 'off' by a millimiter, it's really no issue at all.

I've used this product several times already, and I always get a straight cut.  Would highly recommend.
1140	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great price...Burning strong for the past few months.
Also work nice with Trex decks to get the boards good and tight especially if you have a herring bone in the deck.
7230	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These clamps are great for a medium-scale woodworking project (in our case a table).  They are a snap to install on the pipes purchased from the local big box store.  The only difficult part was screwing on the retaining rings.  I tore my fingers up a bit getting those on the pipe.  Otherwise, these clamps do exactly what we need them to do.  The screw mechanism is smooth and fluid and the sliding clamps work perfectly.

I'm dumb, and I banged it out; so you all can too.

It took a new saw upgrade to even bother to make the change, but im very patient.
  6.5 Amps is more than enough power to cut #20 biscuits in hardwood.  The DW682 glides forward easily and effortlessly cuts biscuits right where you want them.
2282	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I have had this saw for about a month maybe. I have done a couple small projects and it works very well. It WAS nice and quiet.
The only draw back is the push stick is not great for  thin material.  For thick material it works fine.  I like something more  like the Stots push stick for thin material.
2387	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Well worth the money I  spent.
7678	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought one of these for light duty planing tasks - relieving corners, cutting dowels flush and etc.  You do have to hone the pre-ground edge  before you use it the first time.  It is ground to 25 degrees and  recommended final angle is 30 after honing.  I used a Veritas honing guide  and a Japanese water stone to do the job.  It only took about 5 minutes  with the right tools!

2992	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used mine for sanding table tops and similar applications. the bag did fall off. I used some lock-tite thread adhesive, the bag does not fall off now. The bag also has a twist locking mechanism which works fine, so I never need to seperate the lock-tite bond unless I need to open the sander up for repair. That is perhaps the difference between 4.5 stars and 5 stars. Still I think it is better than a 4 star sander.
It's very easy to work with and install the bits, , they should do a promotional write up on the easy install features.

118	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Bought this book light as a Christmas gift for my mother. I haven't heard any complaints since she received it, so it must be working very well!
2709	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Wasn't sure when I purchased it but it worked well with my small plunge router. Really helped in routing two mortise for hinges. Highly recommend.
5892	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	No issues, high quality.  Can't say much about it other than there's no issues and you're getting what you expect.
2764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great drill, but know what you're getting: This model has a big motor yet only spins up to 850 rpm (which is 1/3 the speed of a "normal" drill).  It can power-through most anything and is perfect for spade bits, auger bits, and hole saws. For all your other drilling needs, a light duty model is what you want. Bottom line: this is a great tool at a reasonable price.
9915	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice magnetic option that works well for screws under about 1 1/2". Beyond that it gets very wobbly and the "sleeve" doesn't really help to hold it in place. It's still worth having as long as you know what to expect.


4.  I have had no problem with the profiles sticking and I even take them off and reposition them as one part fills up.
So... it does what it's supposed to do -- pretty well in fact.  To me though, the whole idea is a bad one, and your money is better spent on another tool that will give you better quality mortises and a lot more capability.

8066	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These blades are just so awesome.  I live in a house with plaster walls and could not stand what using a regular jab saw or my Milwaukee Job Saw did to the walls when they needed to be opened up.  That's when I met the Lenox plaster blade.  The teeth really do much better at cutting smoothly on the plaster and keeping your work neater.  You don't have to do extra scoring in order to make neat cuts.  I have not used them much, so I can't comment on the longevity of the blades, but if they run like a typical Lenox product, I think I will buy more of these in the future when this batch gives out.  Definitely a great purchase that can cut down on the amount of patching I will do after working on things.

2398	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Man, compared to my old craftsman 16 this is a dream.  My craftsman would bounce across the tables when i used it (if i didn't bolt it down).  I can put this on any surface and it will just sit, quietly humming ready to destroy wood.  It cuts like a dream.  It is WAY bigger than i expected.  Its really heavy and takes two hands to carry, pick up.  Quick blade changes are awesome.  It literally takes 4 seconds to reposition the wood in and out off cuts.  I love this thing.  There is none better on the market.

Highly recommended.  Absolutely no problems.
7183	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The 5 piece set is what I initially bought. It includes the glue up joint bit, which is nice for gettting a lot of panels to line up properly while gluing. It also includes the door lock bit, which will turn your raised panel, into a drawer front by removing the material around the edge of the back of the door face.
Vibration is minimal, even at higher speeds. This is due, in no small part to the cast-iron work surface and the metal construction of the saw itself. All adjustments are easy and well thought out, except for what I listed below, Bevel markings on the gauge are easy to read and the table locks securely at all possible angles. Blade tension adjuster is easy to use and consistently accurate.  The extended handle makes tension adjustments very simple. The power switch is large and easy to get to.  The blower arm stays where you put it!.  It provides enough air to keep your work piece clear, allowing you to easily see your cutting area.
751	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have electric candle melters around the house and they usually come with 15 watt bulbs.  I had to buy 35 watt ones from CBConcept for the last one I bought and they work really well.  The latest melter I got didn't even heat enough to melt the soy wax with 35 watts, so I purchased these 75 watt ones.  Works like a charm.  It's pretty bright, so I don't use it as a "night light" as planned, but it is great in the living room for some much-needed extra light and the scent from my newly melted melters is divine!

I am still trying to decide if I am going to paint it or just wax it and live with the raw phenolic brown.
1) If it is COLD (below 35F) it has problems starting up due to the rubber isolators being very stiff.  If you have a garage shop as I do, you'll have to keep it in the house until you use it.

5586	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This item is recommended for purchase with the excellent DeWalt DW734 thickness planer, but it does not fit the DeWalt dust port. Fortunately, I also purchased the DustRight dust separator and either it or the planer (I don't remember which) came with the correct adapter.
4 stars for showing its age.
I have used this 18" wrench  for over 15 years, building and disassembling chemical loading systems of  galvanized pipe.  Mine has a little less paint on it, but the jaws are  still sharp.  The jaws are replacable, but I've never had to do that.  I  have also used this wrench for home plumbing projects, but it is a little  large when working in a sink cabinet.  I use it mainly as a  "holder" in that duty, turning the fittings with a 10"  wrench.
489	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I originally bought this for my wife so she could read in bed, but now she uses it with her laptop.  It clips on very easily and provides a lot of light.  It was a real lifesaver during the six days we were without power because of the hurricane.

9109	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After three years of use on several major projects, this item gets 5 stars.  Before purchasing, I researched and interviewed several professionals that used the Paslode Impulse Cordless Framing Nailer.  I carefully read and understood the manufacturer's technical material.  Anyone that does likewise - and knows what to expect before they buy - should be well pleased with this tool. Jobs that once took all day to complete can now be finished in one hour. It's the next best thing to hiring someone to do the job for you. Thanks, Paslode.
3328	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Overall, this is an "ok" light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the "up and over" position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects, and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.

403	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great light.  I have several of these around the house.  They are very bright and nice for reading.  You never have to replace the bulb, but you will go through AAA batteries.  Nonetheless, a great reading light!
7735	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Kind of tricky to assemble, but I have used it to build a porch swing and do a lot of sanding. I can't see how the orange grips would be very useful, but the vice function and the tabletop is very cool. And it folds up easily.
7121	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I haven't found much to dislike about this thing.  It's cheap and does it's job well.  It's large enough that it allows me to stand my ladder off of my rain gutters and sturdy enough that I don't fee like I'm going to slide off the roof as I'm climbing up.  The paint comes off where the thing mounts to the ladder, but it's aluminum and won't rust because of it;  if you're buying it for a decoration, maybe this would be an issue.
If anyone can provide a reason why this practice may be unsafe, if indeed it is, I would be grateful to know about it. It seems that as long as the panel raising bit is well above the template ears, there should be no safety issue. I guess if you need to lower the bit below the table to change the bit, the template ears would definitely have to be removed. Thanks for any feedback you are willing to contribute on this. I'm no expert; just a pragmatist. I'm curious what more experienced woodworkers think about this.

As a side note, I kind of lust after the left-bladed Porter-Cable,  but I worry about safety.  Is a left-handed blade more dangerous for a  right-handed woodworker?  You can see the blade more easily, which sounds  good to me, but it would put the blade much closer to my left hand (i.e.,  my movable clamp).  Just a question for thought...

2581	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A six inch random orbital sander is intended for rapidly removing material from large surfaces (eg. table top).  It is not a detail sander and should not be expected to be lightweight and agile.  Use the right tool for the job.  I am very happy with mine.  It does a very good job of quickly sanding large areas.  Unlike the competition (from a certain black/grey company), this sander provides integrated dust collection.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is two fold.  First, the gear mechanism makes a grinding noise (like it is going to break).  My Dewalt biscuit jointer made a similar noise, but has lasted for years.  Second, the variable speed has a very narrow range of speeds (ie. highest speed is really fast, lowest speed is still really fast).

If you have a stick or can use a tape measure, you don't need the three hinge erector set type template contraption. Solid Aluminum construction is great.  It's the only model I found that clamps to the door.  The others you have to nail in which is the last thing I want to do to a new door. For a few dollars more or in place of the 1/4" radius bit provided with a 1/4" shank, the Hinge-Mate should include a bit for 5/8" radius hinges.  All I seem to see are 5/8" radius hinges and Amazon doesn't carry the bit.  The catch is the 5/8" radius bit only comes with a 1/2" shank.  A smaller router with a 1/4" collet is more than enough to route the door but you need to get yourself a big router to accomodate the 1/2" shank.  I called DC Precision tools and there is no plan or other accessory offered to make a 5/8" radius with the bit provided nor are there plans to make a 5/8" radius bit with a 1/4" shank.

I have the 4000 grit stone as well as the 1000.  I get excellent results and the 4000 grit stone creates truly a razor sharp edge. Yes, it's messy.  Yes, there are some plastic parts that are a bit cheap and flimsy.  But bottomline: it does a very fine job for me.  However.... and a BIG however...... Makita does not make a coarser stone.  Highland Hardware offered one for a while, but it has been discontinued.  Taking the dings out of my planer knives takes a VERY long time with the 1000 grit stone.  I messed up and put off buying the Highland stone.  So, the 1000 grit is as coarse as I can get.  PLEASE Makita, pretty please, offer a coarse stone!!!

The rear jaw has the words "Black & Decker" written on it. You should attach the plastic blocks following diagram 3. The bolts fit the wider hole on the top of the rear jaw. Note that the plastic blocks have two short wings in the bottom.

You should then tighten the bolts to keep the rear jaw in place.

I did put a straight edge to the sole and it had a bit of a crown to it. The center was high. So I spent about an hour in a half re-flattening the sole which was not to bad and expected for the price. The blade seemed pretty sharp I was getting nice wood shavings right out of the package. I was surprised to see it was made in Mexico but I guess a lot of American tool company's manufacturer over there. I wish I had a vertias but I feel confident that this plane will give me many many years of service.
Don't know why but this blade will not cut anything without kicking back.  It will even take chunks out of 2x pine.  Don't even try it on hardwood or cabinet moulding unless you've got a suit of armor on.

It wouldn't matter except that the wood lifted slightly, and that caused an off angle into the blade. Consequently it binded, and sent a piece of wood flying into my stomach at about 50 mph. Okay maybe it was 40, but the speed was irrelevant. What did matter is that it was painful, and forceful enough to leave a welt and scraped the skin. If it wasn't a square ended board, but rather a sharp pointed one, it would be of even greater concern.

They're fairly quick to erect even though I had no help.  They're quite stable with the recommended bracing and the 2204Q handrail makes them MUCH safer than a plank alone.  I hate heights, so that was important for me.  The only real inconvenience is the necessity of having to move the braces to work directly where they're attached or move the pump jack past a brace.  Extra braces have to be used so you can attach a new brace before you remove the existing one.  Since I had a lot of work to do before having to move the braces, I feel it's still a good scaffolding solution. The best advice I can offer is to think through how you plan to move or work around the braces before you put them up.

I haven't used the stick, though it looks like you could make a longer and nicer one in a few minutes. I do, however, use the push block all the time and have found it to be very useful. There are certainly applications were it doesn't work that a custom one would, but that's always the case. I can recommend the push block, could go either way on the stick and just put the featherboard in the trash and back away. Buy the other two separetly if you want them and save [$$$].
We're using this as a flush saw to trim doors down for new flooring and it will slice through painted pine in less than one minute, even if I'm being careful. It has also cut through 1x12 trim boards quickly and cleanly. No binding, no chatter. I prefer the fine cut side to get started, and I'll switch to the fast cut side after I'm about halfway through. It does not need a lot of pressure to continue cutting.
4136	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great set, particularly for the money. (I am also a fan of and own Forrest blades, who finds online arguing about the two a bit petty.) One reviewer here said he had to enlarge the instructions.  Mine are perfectly easy to read and plenty big enough.  Maybe Freud enlarged the print.  I also don't have any trouble reading the size printed on the shims.  If you can't tell the thickness of the chippers apart just by looking at them, I sort of wonder what you are doing woodworking at all.  The only thing I found strange is that the DVD that comes with this set focuses on using the Freud dial-a-width dado.  It's almost as if the manufacturer is trying to make you regret buying the manual set.  Example: the video explains that a big disadvantage of a manual set is that it's easy to lose or misplace chippers (I actually don't think that's true).  Undoubtedly, the famous psychologist of the same name could come up with some explanation for this. In any case, I'm quite happy with the purchase and the results I get with this product.  If you don't get a great results, check to see if you put one of the chippers in backwards.

  Works out of box, no assembly needed.
There's a dvd with an intro on how to use the dado, as well as a chart that tells you which cutter and chipper combos will produce a certain size dado/groove, that comes with the set.  The dvd is specific to the dial-a-width product and really doesn't cover much other than the 'basic of basics' on how to use the dado.  It also has a plan on it for a dado sled.

I used 12 inch drawer slides left over from another project and bought good lockable wheels at Lowes.

There are many ways to tweak and extend the WM's uses; just search the internet.  I am going to buy a WM-425 because I need to set up a router table, a nice one, not some flimsy, undersized table-top version, and after looking at the many dedicated router table bases (~$169 for a simple steel angle-iron base), and the el-cheapo universal bases (~$39 to ~$79(the next best solution after the WM)), it's a no-brainer for me to spend about the same or a little more for a full-on WM-425.  Why? Because I gain the benefits of foldability plus clamping and all the other cool things a WM can do.  Essentially, I can buy one tool and get 2 or more uses out of it, whereas the dedicated base will only and forever be a fixed base.
I found the adjustment screws on the insert to be excellent.  I was able to make it fit snug with no wobble and slightly angled so the front edge is a hair lower than the table and the back edge a hair higher than the table.  The sticker on the back of the Leecraft zero clearance insert indicates the insert will fit a 7491RS. But the fine print says it won't work with the factory splitter.  But the paper directions explain how to create a slot for a DW746 factory splitter.

5410	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased these to splice two 4" fittings together.  The outside edge is just a bit less than 4".  Perfect I thought.  But when I tried to connect the pieces together they only slid in about 1/2"  You see they are tapered and get bigger the further away from the end you go.  This made my connections very unstable.

Adjustments are easy enough.  The fence is an aluminum extrusion with MDF inserts.  It works well, though I don't care for MDF being used in this manner.

I have modified a few of my jigs by gluing 400 grit sandpaper to the bottom of the jig with spray-on contact cement so they grip the workpiece better.  One finger will release even the tightest grip by pulling up in the black release lever.

First I tested it on several bonafide squares, but the Bosch consistently measures off by .3 degrees.  Not huge, but enough to be concerned about when buying a precision tool.  I searched the instructions, only to learn there seems to be no method an end user can set it to a 90 deg benchmark.  In my opinion, this is a shortcoming.  Nothing that is flexible like this, which can also get banged around, will maintain pefect calibration.  Of coruse, one solution is to always add .3 degrees to the reading.  But I am not sure how it will fare at 45 degrees, 23 degrees, etc.

The saw transports well: not too big and heavy. Cord is too short, but they all are. I replaced it with a 14-ga 25' cord. Much better.
So, I have to say that either I got a bad magnet or this tool is not worth owning, or both.  Since a clamp on light will do everything that this can do and more - I don't recommend that you buy one of these!

7991	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	As others have said, this block plane is not shipped in a form that is usable. Mine came with a very rough concave sole (as though someone without much skill flattened it with a 10-inch 20-grit drum sander), the mouth was so poorly made that the blade would not descend beyond the sole, and the movable gate needed some work.
5902	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this insert to use in my DeWalt 746 tablesaw and have found it to be a very high quality accessory.  When my insert plate arrived I was pleased to note that it was dead flat!  Installation was very easy - using the four leveling screws I was able to bring this insert perfectly level with my saw table all the way around.  Once adjusted, the side-to-side and front-to-back adjustment screws took all of the play out of this insert.  I also appreciate the smooth surface which allows my stock to glide across it with little effort.  The finger hole allows easy and quick removal for blade changes, etc.  My only complaint is that I wish it were yellow.  Mine is bright orange, but I can live with that!

Either there was something wrong with the unit that I bought (from a national home/hardware supply store) or I,the  multiple people who help[ed, and customer service at B&D are totally inept. I wasted an entire afternoon on this thing and eventually drove 20 miles to the store to have it assembled by the 'assembly expert' who spent 45 mins on it before declaring defeat. Ironically B&D has a step by step video on youtube shoring how to assemble the cheapie workbench, but no support for assembling this one. The printed instructions are a joke and you need a magnifying glass to decipher the illustrations. I returned the WM425 and bought the cheaper unit that I assembled easily in 20 mins.

The metal is flimsy, plastic parts are used where metal would be expected (including threaded parts - so expect stripping) and pieces (springs) had fallen off during shipping (it's up to you to figure out where they go). The directions for both assembly and use are very skimpy. The assembly of one particular part was not even included. One of the 3 top boards (jaws) was warped and has to be replaced. I suppose it will be minimally useful, but this is certainly not anything I'd recommend buying. If returning wasn't so difficult, I'd send it back in a heartbeat. Shame on you, Black & Decker.

7538	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is my first folding workbench ever. I did all of my previous projects on a fixed workbench in my basement. I consider myself as a handy person, but I had trouble assembling WM425 workbench because the assembly instructions did not mention at all the correct positioning of the jaws at the top of the workbench. The metal frame of the workbench has multiple cutouts which can accommodate the jaws, so I had to experiment with it to ensure that I can raise the front jaw. I am specifically complaining about steps 3 and 4 of the assembly instructions. A diagram showing the correct positioning of the jaws related to the metal frame would have helped, but it is missing now.
I've been happiest with this saw since a carbide blade was installed some years ago.  Although this is a terrific TRIM saw, I wouldn't recommend it for the ONLY circular saw in your toolbox.  This is because maximum cutting depths are too shallow for 2x4s and other thicker stock, and because it cuts much slower (on heavy stock) than a bigger, more powerful, saw.  It is a well-designed, professional grade tool.

Their warranty requires you to have a licensed installer. But that isn't my complaint. Its their useless service that renders the most possible difficulty and monetary gain on the company that disturbs me. I actually dropped off my heater to get fixed when this company was named SuperGreen, seems they changed names. Their supposed heating element that lasts 20 years was broken in 10 months. When I tried to pick it up, they made it as difficult for me to pick up as possible after 5pm at the worst traffic. They are never in the office, but if you show up they will try to make a show that they are working hard. If you call them its some VOIP callback system with really bad sound quality, the baby crying in the background gives it away pretty quickly. This product seems like some kind of repackaged Alibaba heater, as the Celsius reading is obviously not made for the USA market.
1328	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They work as advertised.

There are recessed areas or lips cast into both ends of the table for attaching in-feed and out-feed extensions made from 3/4" material. They basically just rest on these lips, so ledger blocks need to be fastened to the lower side of the extensions and then spring clamps installed between these blocks and the underside of router table ends to secure them in place. There's no guidance in the in the owner's manual on how to do this, so you're really on your own here.
The bases of the Stanley tools may not be as perfectly flat as those of the expensive Lie Nelsons, but that's easily rectified in short order with some sandpaper and a sheet of glass. A fine tool at an excellent price.

I immediately researched and and ordered the Irwin mini clamp. This product is well made, just like its larger brother, and very sturdy.  I've now used this clamp a dozen plus times and it has worked flawlessly.  I like the fact that it comes it a two pack.  This is very helpful when working with small items and it gives you the flexibility to clamp items in two or more places.

3876	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought this guard for my new Unisaw, reckoned I'd be as safe as possible without spending mega more $ on the Biesemeyer. Nice item, seems to seldom require any attention or removal once installed and set up. Installation on saw w/ Unifence and Delta outfeed table kinda cramped on backside of saw, due to limited accessibility, but overall a good fit. I elected to waive the relocation of the power switch, kind of a hassle reaching up there when cutting 8'x4' panels.
450	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased two of these to use back stage at a dramatic presentation.  The clip/battery pack is large so it can be clipped to most anything (I clipped one on a step edge).  The switch allows you to choose having one or two LED's lit and the light spread is bright, wide and equal across its view.  The flexible "goose-neck" is sturdy and stays in the position it is flexed into.  The quality of workmanship seems excellent.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  They also arrived on time as promised and were packaged securely.  And it even came with batteries!  Cheap ones, but so far I've used them for about 10 hours and they're still going bright!
9558	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These worked perfectly for our Kitchen cabinet installation.  I look forward to using them for other projects as well.
9485	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This blade does an excellent on most woods. However, when you encounter the heartwood of some tough trees, it does some dancing. Nice thing about it is it uses much less battery power than a small chain saw.
3647	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This model has been basically unchanged for decades- in fact my first experience with it was in high-school shop class 40+ years ago.  I just purchased my 3rd or 4th  - the others are all out on jobsites somewhere leaving me without a personal sander to use, so I bought another one today. I give it 5 stars because it's a  rugged, professional tool that should last for decades. It does exactly what is supposed to do - it spins sanding belts letting you grind away at 'whatever'.  Pro features include a lever that releases the belt, making changes a snap, a very good tracking adjustment, a platen that is easy to replace when needed,and a fairly long cord (3 prong - this is a metal housed tool that does require grounding).  Now that I've built it up quite a bit, let me tell you some bug-a-boos that have always been part of the Porter-Cable sanding experience...  As others have mentioned - the dust port location on top is a real nuisance. The bag is always in the way, and remove it at your peril- you will be eating/breathing a direct stream of dust.  Older models had a metal elbow that diverted the dust to the side - but this model comes with only the bag - and the bag opening has way too much "slop" so you will still wind up eating/wearing dust.  Most pros cobble it up with some duct tape or cable ties  - and/or take it off altogether and cobble on some kind of pipe diverter.  The other "quirk" of this model is the shape - it is relatively difficult to mount the unit upside down for bench sanding of small parts,  sharpening chisels and plane irons, etc.  Note that I said "difficult" compared to the square Makita or other "modern" sanders.  Problem being those are also gutless toys by comparison.  So again, 'pro' users find ways to do it - they  build mounting jigs etc. to mount their porter-cable  sanders on a workbench.  If you search Google or YouTube you'll find plans for mounting jigs and so forth. Bottom line - go for it, if you need a good rugged (heavy-duty) pro belt sander - you won't be disappointed by this tool.
Lathe Chisels - Anything with bevels is easy - just like bevel chisels.  Gouges must be done freehand, but that works fine.

159	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I love these little lights!  They are great for clipping to the kids' headboards so they can read at night in bed without bothering one another (they're in bunk beds).  They're also great because they come with us on all our weekend trips.  They are sturdy, last forever and can take the abuse of kids twisting them all around.  I also like that they have 2 brightness levels.
My concerns about 16 ounces not being enough mass to drive large nails were alleviated the first time I used this hammer to demolish and re-frame parts of an exterior wall for window and door installation. I found it comfortable to swing and easy to aim given the decrease in mass. It is perfectly balanced.

So, please do not think these will solve every hold-down problem. They will not help you extract every last inch of material from thin boards. They are not as good as Grr-rippers for small parts. But when properly adjusted for rip cuts, they are a wonderful addition to other safety devices. They save time when making multiple rips and they cooperate with a well-adjusted fence to make perfect accurate thin strips.
This light is fantastic.  It has two LEDs and I can light both or just one with the press of a button.  The clasp is snug and also wide enough to fit around many pages of a book.  I really like that the light is flexible so I can adjust it to any reading position.
The ease of dumping the 32 gallon galvanized trash can (not included but super cheap available locally) can't be overstated. A quick flip, into a larger plastic trash can, lined with a large trash bag, and right back on the unit.

2634	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I want to give this light 5 stars but I can't say it deserves it.  The head on mine never wants to swivel at all.  It feels like if I try and force it, its going to snap clean off so I've stopped trying.  Overall, the light provides pretty good illumination but the top will get warm fairly quickly.  Its been very tough and rugged as it has been dropped repeatedly.  So far nothing has broken or cracked.  The replaceable batteries make it convenient to use.  You can expect to get a good amount of time out of a single battery (depending on the life and condition of your batteries) before having to swap them out.  What would be nice is if they would develop an LED upgrade.  This would make the battery stretch for hours.

7875	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Indeed, this is changing a 5 star review to a two star.  I got one of the last Japan-issue versions, and planned on keeping it forever.  However, this didn't pan out.  The new China version is very poor by comparison.  First, the cat's paw doesn't have the close tolerance of the original.  It can't get small trim nails.  In fact, the whole effect seemed dramatically different and I gouged the hell out of some plywood (didn't happen with original).  Next, the ultra-thin blade is not so thin at all.  I have other prybars by Hyde and Red Devil which win handily now in terms of thin-ness.  Finally, the blade was actually ground differently on the inside edge, a clear sign of sloppy craftsmanship, it was maybe 3/32 different on one side.  Very disappointed in Shark.  If you have the best tool and can't cut it as a company, just raise the price, don't become a lesser thing for the same price.  Now this bar is in between what it was and something you can buy at HD, and now I have to shop for a proper one.

I have to agree with other reviewers, the "manual" is dismal, get Router Basic's and The Router Handbook, by Patrick Spielman, and you won't care about the manual. I bought this monster to mount in a table so the weight isn't really a big deal, and put it to work almost immediatly on some red oak (what is the deal with red oak? doesn't anyone like pine anymore?) I am shaping for a chest project. Some reviewers have compared the noise to a 747, I think it is more like the Space shuttle taking off, but with ear protection its not too bad. Started out with the speed setting on 5, but dialed it down to 3, it had no problems swinging the 3/4 beading bit and did a real nice job. I like the adjustment knob and the on/off switch, both easy to use. Had no problems with the collet/nut as some reviewers had. I thought I might have to beef up my 1/4 phenolic plate, but it handled the weight just fine. Finding screws to mount it just took a trip to the hardware store and we were in business.

I have never had any problems with them (I own 2 of them) and  have done just about everything with them. If you have to use them a lot it  won't take long to notice how much easier it is to do a job when your tools  aren't weighing you down. If you need 18" pipe wrenches give these  some serious consideration.
It's all that and a bag of chips-

The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life, unlike the the itty-bittys, which I found went through batteries like crazy. Of course, the LED "bulbs" don't burn out like the itty-bitty blubs (and the XtraFlex2 doesn't heat up from its bulbs, either).

For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same.

It is up to you to determine which model will work best for you but for me, the 500X does all I need until they improve the model that sharpens spade bits.

It is now about two weeks after I wrote the above review. Five additional contacts with Amazon just resulted in UPS going to the wrong address again to pick it up. But a conversation with the UPS guy at my office may have broken the stalemate. He said he'd be back this afternoon to pick it up.  Grand total contacts with Amazon customer service are now in excess of ten, and the latest advice of the pickup says I may be charged for the return shipping costs.  For a damaged item.

I have two relatively minor complaints. As others have noted, the dust collection port on the saw is a joke. The other problem I have had deals with trying to read the bevel gauge. At 90 degrees, it it nearly impollible to get a straight view of the hair line in order to line it up directly on the 90 degree line. Fortunately, it is easy to use a compound square for this setting in lieu of the gauge. My list of two flaws didn't include the depth of cut adjustment (it doesn't work) only because no one should buy this saw to cut dados anyway.

I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders. They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published (presumably figuring that a lot of kids, little and big, were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed...). The leftovers were sold at half price, a real bargain. I bought one, tried it out, loved it, and went back to buy several more for use as gifts (and spares).
Then, one day, I saw a 16 ounce leather handled Estwing with a curved claw in a hardware store and did a bit of looking into it, and found out that Estwing still made that exact hammer--my grandfather's hammer!  Who would have believed it!?!  So I had the store order me the straight claw version (because who in their right minds wants a curved claw?  Anything a claw hammer can do, a rip hammer can do better.)

This is due to the plastic reflector overheating and becoming discolored.  I opened the light up and the plastic had a burnt smell to it.  Basically a poor design as the light is unable to handle the amount of light / heat that the bulb produces over a normal period of time.  Do not recommend purchase of this unit as the reflector issue ruins what is otherwise a nice light.

5131	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a great dust collector. All the right pieces for a great price... especially when you get free shipping. One thing I wanted to clear up is the difference between a dust collector and a shop vac. Typical Dust Collector (DC) static suction is about 8-12 inches of water. In other words, the dust collector can pull a static column of water about a foot high. The 50-850 is rated at 11.4", so its at the top of range. Nice! But DC's, as a whole, are meant to pull large volumes of air not large amounts of suction power. A typical tank style 2.5 hp shop vac can pull around 60 inches of water... much higher static suction power. But with air movement ratings at around 150 cfm, no where near the volume of air that a DC can. The 50-850 is rated at 1200 cfm. You can't beat a good DC for pulling and fltering a large volume of air. Great for planers, table saws etc. But don't expect to use them to vacuum the family minivan though they will do that too in a pinch. The Delta 50-850 is a great dust collector, good static vacuum, nice large volume of air, great price and quality from a reputable company... but don't throw away your shop vac.
Yes I would refer this item to anyone.


Once it's set up, using the WM 425 is straightforward; just take whatever you'd like to work on, open the "jaws" of the clamping table to the appropriate width, then clamp it down. The middle board comes out, and the top part of the table (the plank furthest from the clamp handles) can be moved in to the middle position. This affords it a lot of options for width. The unit comes with four orange clamping pegs which can be put in to the surface of the table to provide more flexibility in adjusting the table to the right size, or working with different angles. I'd recommend getting a couple of extra spring or bar clamps though, especially if working with a lot of odd shaped materials or when doing a lot of cuts - the pegs are okay, but don't work in every situation all that easily, and they take some time to adjust.

The PC7310 is much more than I expected for the cost. The body up to the electrical end cap is metal. The end cap is plastic, nothing wrong with that. I had thought all the dark body may be plastic.
There seem to be relatively few circular saws made with the 8-1/4" blade, but at least on this DeWalt DW384, the depth of cut is 1/16" shy of 3", close enough for my needs. At close to $200, it is a bit pricey for a home-owner-class circular saw (not comparing it to worm drive saws that tend to be more expensive), but it was still less than the rental stores wanted for an all-day professional pavement cutting saw. So I bought the DW384, along with a couple suitable blades (Evolution Power Tools 8-1/4" BLADE DM FURY 3 Diamond Masonry Tile Cutting Blade) and a Vermont American 5/8" to 1" arbor adapter ring (required to adapt the 1" hole in the blade to the 5/8" arbor on the saw).

One final note, it does not come with a carrying pouch. It has built in bubble levels, both for vertical and horizontal at the same time, but I would treat this with more respect than an aluminum level you may throw in the back of the truck. Therefore the Yellow Smart Tool carrying bag from MD Building Products makes a good addition to your purchase. It is a longer carrying case than the Bosch, but it fits it in every other dimension like it was custom built for it. It showed up when I added the Bosch to the shopping cart, as an item that others most frequently bought with it.

7865	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I have one of the original aluminum die-cast Workmates (made in Great Britain in the 70's) that had seen its better day.  So I went with this "updated" model from Black & Decker.  What a joke and an extremely poor excuse for "progress".  It's mostly made of cheap stamped metal and plastic parts that make for a very rickety and unstable platform that is a mere wisp of the original Workmate.  It came damaged, and I have since had to replace several plastic parts to keep it some form of working order (such as it is).  When I finally get some time, I am going to refurbish my old Workmate and junk this POS.

Besides Sheetrock the unit allows accurate fixture placement.  I used the panel lift to hold a folding attic stair case before nailing.  I was able to locate the unit precisely between joists prior to nailing.  One other job inwhich it was invaluable was the lowering of light fixtures.  As part of a demolition, I was given 40 light fixtures but I had to remove them and they were on a twelve foot ceiling.  No problem.  I'd raise the panel lift to secure the light, cut wires, unscrew the fixture and lower it with no damage.  That one job paid for the lift. What would have been a two man job became a one man job
I haven't moved my Board Buddies since I installed them on the track.  I keep them close to each end of the blade so that I can feed short or long stock into the saw with no worries.  It makes sense to me that one would want them to be close to the blade since that's where you'd need them.  What this means is that I don't really have a use for the track.  I adjust the Board Buddies side-to-side all the time but not forward/backward.
Its a nicely thought out unit...and the price is right.

1703	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased one of these a couple of years ago to finish sand the maple  cabinets I was making for my wife's kitchen.  They are pretty much  one-of-a-kind in that the raised panels are made from Eastern Curly Maple  and the stiles and rails are Birdseye Maple.  The point is, of course, this  is a super hard wood, that is difficult to work with, and takes a while to  sand.  This sander worked flawlessly, efficiently, and more importantly,  comfortably through twenty-five of these doors.  I think that is what  really sets this little sander apart from all in its class.  It is quiet,  and its ergonomics make it a pleasure to use. It does use slightly more  than one-quarter sheet of sandpaper, though, to cover its base and fit in  the clamps. I readily recommend this sander for finish applications.

I will update this in about six months if I am not as happy or I find other problems.  These reviews help everyone and especially myself so I like to return the favor.  Cheers.
I found it hard to fold the tool back together and I don't think the tool is strong enough to take much abuse, not that it necessarily should be designed to be.

Then you could Y them together and collect virtually all the dust.  Have used it to make furniture, door jambs, tables, trim, and a variety of toys.  Add a good set of Whiteside router bits and you are set.

Drywall screw guns have a clutch in them that only engages when you are pushing on it. Pull the trigger, nothing happens. Push the screw into the wall, and it engages, drives the screw, and stops all in a fraction of a second. Once you get the hand of it, you will have perfect results almost every time. Every once I need to touch up with a regular drill but that is maybe one screw every 2-3 sheets, and typically because a joist/stud isn't quite lined up, or some other issue.

Just a note. Don't for get to download the Pantone Color manager so that you can export your new books/swatches to Adobe products or the like. There are instructions in the books on how to download the color manager. To export, update all books in the manager then go to file and export to your software. I thought Pantone would update with Adobe swatches automatically but they do not. You have to add the books manually. This was kinda a pain and a bit confusing so I thought I'd let others who are purchasing know.

Overall, this is a nice product, especially for electricians.
4983	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I do not know how I did it before this tool came into my arsenal- It is a monster that makes quick work of boring holes between studs or joists to run pipes or wires. Once you use one of these with a self feed or auger bit, you will never use a standard drill with a wimpy paddle spade bit again for this purpose!

The light has more than enough brightness to read by without binding you, or lighting up the whole room.
This tool also does not leave any marks on the cumaru.
I wouldn't be so irritated if the company had the courtesy to respond to my Email, but I have waited since 1/7/2008 and seen nothing except a automatic reply on 1/7/2008 telling me I would get an answer within a few days.

2067	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This kit is just average. Although all the inserts fit well, they are low grade metal, and without a centering locator which should always be supplied with one of these kits, the inserts are difficult if not impossible to center, resulting in worn out bushings.

After putting it all together, I had it all squared up in a matter of a few minutes.  The adjustments are pretty basic, mostly just tilting the rails a bit until the fence is square with the table, then adjusting it square with the miter gauge slots.

3688	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Received it for a Christmas gift and it sat in my shop for a year. Recently I needed it to sand a counter top I was building, so out it came from the tool cabinet. I cut the plastic bands from the box ,hooked up the dust bag ,adjusted the tracking and started sanding. In about 15 minutes the sander began to slow down and sparks were shooting from the brushes. I also was getting an electrical shock from the trigger. I check the Internet for solutions and decided to change the brushes. It destroyed 2 sets of brushes and sparks were still shooting out of the motor. This sander is a piece of crap and I think the dust collection is garbage. The entire motor housing was filled with saw dust when I was sanding. I'm really starting to doubt the quality of porter cable tools. For $200 dollars, I think their quality control should be a lot better. I think I might try a makita next time. Always try a new power tool when you get it before you put it away. Lesson learned.

Make sure you need a sliding miter.  You may be better off with a RAS and a standard miter saw.
To give you an estimate of how long they last. I ran approximately 20 boards (approx 20"- 40" long) of varying thickness through my planer. All were hard wood. After about the fifth board I started to notice some very minor grooving. Now the grooves are bigger and it is getting time to change them. However they are still in the range that a quick sanding will remove the grooves. So they do ok up against a hard wood. But will not last forever. Dual sided makes these well worth it.
What do I do? I can repair the part myself which is probably less hassle than shipping things back. It isn't an expensive part. I had already broken down all the packaging for recycling since I didn't realize the problem until everything was installed. My lesson learned is to purchase future equipment from local vendors or directly from the manufacturer rather than go through Amazon. After purchasing a number of tools from Amazon due to the price, I doubt I do so in the future.
Like one of the other reviewers noted, forget precision work. You need to have a completely smooth top without added variables that make a seemingly simple process a little extra complicated.
I've had this for about 6 months now. The weight of the dust collector hose slowly pulled the duct tape connection apart. I went to the hardware store and got a fernco 3" no hub connector. It worked perfectly! It holds tight and looks professional now.

6201	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just have to smile every time I use my Orbital Super Sawzall. It runs so smooth, I have to check to make sure it's plugged in.(not really but almost)It has the new METAL quick-loc blade clamp. A vast improvement over  the original. As another reviewer already mentioned, there are more  positions on the adjustable shoe. You get two varible speed controls. One  on the trigger for careful cutting, and one on a speed dial  for cutting  different materials. If you run full speed on steel or other hard materials  you will burn your blades up. With the 6521 you can dial it down to nothing  if you want to. Basically it's a super sawzall on steroids. You get more  power,plus the only infinitely variable orbital action I know of. Believe  me, it works ! I have had orbital saws from other companies in the past. I  sold all of them to make room for something better.  I needed something  that could be run continuously without dislodging my fillings, and making  my hands numb. So I got the super sawzall.(Reviewed it in November) I love  it. But sometimes I need more than one, like when I'm on multiple jobs. I  thought about getting a cheapie but resisted the urge. Boy am I glad. The  6521-21 exceeded all my expectations. Obital action with no vibration. Plus  they retained all the good features of the 6537. Including the impact  protecting clutch,and a LIFETIME WARRANTY two things you won't get anywhere  else.  I highly recommend the 6521!

This tool is a huge technological leap forward when compared to mechanical protractors/angle finders; because the electronic LED display shows the angle to a tenth of a degree.

I have owned this hammer for a long time - at least 6-8 years, and although the metal has tarnished to a dark grey it is still in as good of shape as the day I bought it.  The face has remained very flat and true and the handle grip is holding up just fine.  I love the balance of this hammer and the weight is just right for jobs like framing where power is more important than finesse.

It is a bit of a battery hog, but it places out some serious directional light that you can adjust.  What I like about it is the fact that it does not go from working to NOT working, when you are up in an attic or crawl space.  It will slowly start to dim so you know it is time to swap out the battery for a fresh one.  Always check to make sure it is compatible with your rechargeable batteries.

4654	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Have only recently used this product and it works great, I had a cheap one I purchased before deciding on If I wanted to invest in this type of woodworking tool and now I'm glad I did.
All I can say is I am impressed with the way this blade performs over other blades I have used. It has made my Bosch saw as smooth as silk in ripping hardwoods to make window jambs on a job, and cut my working time down due to not having to sand in order to remove saw marks and/or rough edges.
Plan on using an inconspicuous place on your house and practicing for about 2 or 3 hours until you get it right. Don't give up. My first day was very frustrating. Lots of clogging. At first I could only use the tool for about 10 seconds before it totally gummed up. Uggh. But with practice, clogging (gumming) is actually quite minimal when you find the right "angle of attack" for your application. Gumming usually occurs when you hold the grinder in one place too long or try to cut too deeply in one pass. You can't expect to realistically remove more than about 1/64 of an inch per pass, maybe even as little as 1/128 of an inch per pass. This equates to about 4-6 passes, sometimes up to 10 passes for severely cupped and warped wood. But this type of use allows for almost constant grinding with very little gumming. When the tool does gum up use a small, wooden-handled ice-pick to "pop" the gum chunks off of the grinding disc. A cleaning session takes about 1-2 minutes or even less. An occasional brushing with a wire brush helps prevent re-gumming on paint covered, problem spots on the disc. This technique works so well that I only change the disc when the teeth wear down and stop cutting effectively (4-8 hours of use, depending). I have only soaked the discs in mineral spirits one time and generally find it unnecessary.

 The splitter is thin enough to use with any thin-kerf blade. Biesemeyer, are you reading this? The Biesemeyer splitter, while more robust and expensive, will not work with a thin-kerf blade, unless one tediously grinds down the thickness of the body on the splitter assembly.

Ordinary clamps apply force in one direction, and the result will not look right. These apply force in two directions.

2: Build material and quality: Top notch. I feel like these will last forever. They are plastic but there is no flex or twisting at all whatsoever. The spring is very heavy duty compared to other clamps and the rubberized gripping tips are the perfect material mixture for strength and grip.
  I will not repeat much of what has been written about other shortcomings such as size the inabillity to hold data, etc.  But every tool has its limitations, so its the users responsiblity to match his/her needs with a tools capabilities.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is, the market place is lacking highly accurate angle finders.  So this product fills that void well, and although it could use some improvements, overall, its still very useful vs. any other device I have found.  And although others find the price high, I would disagree, as for a precision instrument such as this, I consider the price fair.  Measuring angles in high precision is much more difficult then making other measurements such as distance, depth, etc.
But the real story here is Grizzly's attitude toward customer service. They had the incorrect picture on the site (since fixed) that misled me into believing that it was the hose that had attachments. The part number was correct, though, and when I received the hose I realized my mistake. When Amazon invited me to comment on the sale I mentioned the error, but still gave Grizzly 4 stars for smooth transaction and quick shipment. Within 2 hours I had email from Grizzly saying that they had realized their error and that they were shipping me the merchandise shown in the picture. I was stunned. This was far beyond anything that they could reasonably be expected to do.
4666	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	If the magnetic base on this light were twice as strong, it would be worth owning and deserve a high rating.  As it turns out, the magnetic base is far too weak for many of the applications that this light is intended for.  Here are some things I tried with this light:
 it would have been nice to know what I was buying in the first place..
I will add that these clamps are made in the USA and they are very similar to the same style of clamps that were passed on to me by my dad. I have a lot of respect for this style of clamps. The 3/4 inch pipes can stand up to the strain without bending or deforming. If you take care of the threaded portions, the clamps will last a lifetime and beyond. I prefer this style of clamps because of the durability and the clutch mechanism. My dad's old clamps used a clutch that had teeth that bite into the pipe. When I really torque down onto the clamp the skin of the pipe is deformed. I also have to pry the release lever up to release the clutch on the old style clamps. The clutch plates on these pony clamps won't do that. My 12 year old son helped me on my latest project and he was able to slide the pony clamps back and forth on the pipe after he disengaged the clutch. He was also able to reasonably tighten the clamps.

Fourteen inches is pretty tall so it may very well be flex in the blade that came with it. I'm still using that blade so have nothing to compare it to.
One thing I don't like is the blade attachment. There is a thumb screw at top and bottom that holds the blade. When you tighten a blade, the screw has a tendency to twist the blade out of vertical. Now I put the blade in crooked and the thumbscrew will straighten it. Like many others, I'm not too crazy about the hold down, but it does work and is actually pretty easy to adjust.

 The Porter Cable 42000 kit is made out of white metal. Their are some manufacturers that make them out of brass, but this kit is hard to beat. The price is right, and it does the job more than adequately. My one gripe is that they are hard to remove from the metal base plate in my Fein. No way to grip the spinninng bottom that sits perfectly flush with the plate. A huge rubber eraser might help. :-) I plan on coating them with WD-40 so that ease of removal doesn't become a problem.

One other thing.  Using any saw blade can be dangerous; using a full dado stack the first time can be VERY intimidating and dangerous if you aren't careful.  Make sure all your safety gadgets are in place so you can deal with the intimidating part so you don't 'accidently' experiance the dangerous part of while using it.  That said, after making a full depth, clean bottomed dado in one pass, all I can think to say is "sweet"!  Feeling intimidated by all those spinning blades quickly fades to healthy respect.

4173	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased a Jet 14 inch closed base bandsaw.  It works great.  Before I ordered any blades for it, I decided to get the Riser block first.  The Riser block increases your cutting height from 6 to 12 inches.  Your  band saw blade size will then go from 93 1/2 inches to 105 inches.  If you  need this, get it before you buy any blades because your old blades will be  too short.  This is not an item that you can take off at any time.  It is a  permanent option.  The Riser Block was very easy to install.  You remove  the big bolt that holds the top wheel support the the bottom and add the  Riser block and use the new bolt to secure it.  The kit comes with a metal  rear blade guard.  The one that came with my saw was plastic.  The only  tricky part was lifting off the upper wheel and reattaching it.  Since it  is fastened at the back, it wanted to tip forward.  With me Riser  installed, I can resaw fire wood and thick beams into boards.  Think of all  the flavors of wood you can now use for projects.

3767	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My Dewalt "Job Site Saw" uses the Dewalt 24 tooth general purpose blade out of the box. The standard blade performs well for most jobs; however, I wanted a finer tooth blade for cabinet work. The DW3114 40 tooth blade gives a much finer cut when cutting cabinet grade 3/4 inch plywood. I'm sure the blade will also perform well on laminate, based how it's cutting plywood. The 24 tooth blade has stayed sharp during one year of moderate use. If I get comparable service from the 40 tooth blade, I will be very pleased with my purchase.

If you are cutting anything inside, get a good respirator, goggles, and use a shop vac and have a buddy trace your cut as you go with the vac. You will create a lot of dust. Put the shop vac exhaust outside unless you have a good HEPA filter on it. Even then you will get dust. Also buy plastic and cover off the area that you will be working in so that the dust will not spread everywhere. TURN OFF the Central AC if you have one.

Orbital action.  When you're rough cutting lumber, nothing assists you like an orbital action.  This allows the blade to more aggressively cut through the material with less binding and less discomfort to the operator.

The fence is decent -- good enough that I don't have any plans to replace it -- and the router plate leveling system is good though it was a bit fussy for me to get "just right".  The dust collection that comes with it is mediocre at best.  I've got a Jet dust collector with 4" plumbing and plenty of blast gates around the shop, so I've got plenty of capacity to evacuate dust from the bench.  However, the dust collection attachment on the router fence just doesn't fit very well.  I'll end up replacing it with something more useful.

However, after a lot of looking, it became clear that this is the de facto standard, and that lift makers pretty well assume that this is what you will use.

5508	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty. But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record. I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits. Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit. Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway. So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that. Happy woodworking!!

5096	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this blade about 12 months back and was thrilled with it for about one month.  It cut through maple and cherry (up to 2" thick) "like butter."  And then it was dull and prone to all the trials and tribulations of dull blades (kick-back, etc.).  When it was brand new it cut better than any blade I have owned but at the price it should!  At the price, it should also have retained its edge for a lot longer (I've had really cheap (Skil 10") and mid-priced (Hitachi, et al) blades last MUCH longer and some even started off almost as sharp).
3941	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This unit works good enough for my use. I don't use it that often & running out of room to set up another machine. Outstanding tool for those like me that use it just every now & then.
4919	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Cuts through materials of all types (with the right blade). Extremely easy to control due to the comfortable barrel grip. Blade change is quick and almost effortless. Dust blower is effective but requires the use of wrap-around eye protection. I do seem to have trouble keeping my cuts perfectly square but this is the plight of every jig saw user (small shoe, difficult to keep flat on cutting surface). Overall, I am very happy.
Also I am glad it was me and not my kid in there when it went boom.
The price point of this unit is so attractive that I thought I'd be nuts to not have a second table.  The only thing a serious home woodworker lacks is "multiple" machine setups like an industrial shop.  I invested almost $1,700 in my first table with a sophisticated permanent lift, a sleek table with just the holes drilled for my router, and of course extremely well machined parts for accuracy with an awesome fence.  All this is great, but it still needs to be setup for each and every operation, this takes time.
SO, since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily, are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw, just get them if you are doing CM.
All in all I am very happy with this tool.  Now back to sanding.
2257	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice accessory to have, if you already own a DeWalt battery pack and the charger.  Basically, that would limit my recommendation of this product to those who already own a cordless 14.4 volt DeWalt tool.  While the flashlight itself is relatively inexpensive at about $25, the battery pack and the charger are not.  The battery pack cost more than $50 apiece.  Add the cost of the charger and you get the idea that this is not a flashlight system that you buy on its own.  But, if you already own the battery packs and the charger, then spending an additional $25 will get you a very powerful and durable flashlight.

One thing about the angle - a long bit in tandem with the chuck and the shoulder can make this a bitt difficult to fit in tight places.  Works fine for standard spaced studs for example, but anything smaller than that and you're going to need to choke up on the bit.  This can make using larger bits a bit of a challenge.

Update: I contacted DeWalt and was provided the following product number for a dust bag to the DWS780:  N126162. I don't see this on their website, but a google search turns up a lot of sources to purchase this item. I will edit this review again once the bag has been delivered and tested.

They clip on to the edge of a book of tablet case, etc. and are small enough that they are not always in your way.  The base is shaped so that it not only holds the batteries, but will sit flat on a table if needed.  However, because it doesn't "flatten out", it may be awkward to stuff into a travel case with a book nook or tablet. This is a small inconvenience, to get such good light, though.  I would buy it again.

The belt tracks well with only occasional adjustments  It does have a stream of air that comes out of the motor (for cooling) that tends to hit you in the face and you need to keep clear of that when sanding or after a few minutes your eyes get a lot of very fine dust in them.  I've heard some reviewers complain about heat build-up on the belt, but they might be putting too much pressure on the sander or have cheaper belt.

Something this big is best in a STURDY router table, particularly if you install an accurate motorized lift. You will need a STOUT table to resist cabinet-drop since this beast is heavy. I'd recommend a heavy rigid cabinet too, since this develops plenty of centrifugal force and push-back when routing hardwoods like Oak. Use THICK commercial hold-downs and feather-boards with this. Don't stand in the line-of-fire. Use lower speeds for big bits. I haven't had any problems, but I am VERY careful. You wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of a kick-back from this mule.

The scale locks down solid and does not slip (a big problem with my $15.00 combination square).
I removed the stock feet from the ladder and commenced the install. Instructions state that the stabilizers should be mounted flush with the base of the ladder. However, the lowest rung on the ladder prevented the brackets for being flush. Where the bottom of the bracket should have aligned with the bottom of the ladder, there was not enough ladder material to drill 2 holes for the lower bolts. I thought about attempting to modify the ladder, but in the end I decided to grind off a bit of material from the underside portion of the stabilizer bracket where it was hitting the low rung on the ladder. The brackets lined up fine after that.

2726	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have had my DW788 for about two months. I have used it to cut about one hundred Christmas ornaments out of a wide variety of 1/4 hardwoods. I have cut stacks of four at a time but have done most of the cutting with one ornament at a time. I have used Pegas, Flying Dutchman, Olson and Craftsman blades on size 2 through 9.  Being a cheapskate I built my own stand and attached a cheap led light. I use a foot switch to operate the saw, which is in turn connected to Niles current sensing outlet. I have shop-vac connected to the outlet so that it powers on when I depress the foot switch. I have been very please with the results. The saw operates smoothly and makes clean cuts. I cannot say that there has been a single issue related to the saw in the time I have owned it. I was previously using a Delta 40-540. The Delta was approximately ten years old and showing signs of wear. The improvement in cut quality of the Dewalt is amazing. Whether I am making inside cuts or cutting the final product from the blank, the results are perfect. This saw is without questions one of the best tool purchase I have made.

2647	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Everyone loves this saw, or so it seems from the reviews.  I like this saw as well, I own it.  I've had it for over a year and a half and I've cut everything from 1x4s to 6x6s, mostly for framing.  I still think it lacks power compared to a worm drive, which isn't all that much more expensive.  Here's what I'd like you to consider before buy a circular saw: try out a worm drive before buying anything. Brakes are a definate plus, for you don't want to slow down when you're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut.  Also consider the $60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser.  Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws, and what a great price.  If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw.  If you want to buy milwaukee, buy the version of this circular saw with a brake, you'll thank yourself later.

I found a 5-gallon bucket at Lowe's that fits pretty well. It's not a perfect fit but it works well enough for my purposes. The trouble is that because the lid doesn't fit tightly to the bucket there's nothing to stop it tipping over, causing either the lid to fall off the bucket or the bucket to fall over and dump the sawdust all over the floor. It's not helped by the fact the inlets don't seem to quite fit anything so I end up with a bunch of adapters, which in turn make it more likely it will tip over.
The secret is in the sharpness of the blade. Hone a very sharp edge on this block plane's blade and it will work just as well as a block plane costing 10x as much. The block plane makes a great addition to any contractors/carpenters kit bag, or even for the fine woodworker too as long as you are prepared to spend that 20-30 minutes tuning it up to shape straight from the box.
 So, After we discovered that the belt-drive that makes the handles turn together was mis-aligned, we set to fixing that first. once that was done, we got all the boards on top. None of them lined up well. The cranks to tighten the work clamps are not going to last because they are cheap plastic "snap-ons". The belt skips constantly, and is cheap plastic. The wood surface has numerous flaws as well. The metal frame is banged up too, despite the box being fine.

Mess - A little, yes.  The machine has an excellent spray shield that can be raised to just below the plane of the work surface.  Most cast-off water or slurry is caught by this shield.  As I type this, I am wearing the sweatshirt I was wearing 30 minutes ago when using the grinder.  My shirt is bone dry.
8896	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This handsaw is very sharp and the two different edges are a nice feature. One edge for a fine cut and the other edge when ya just need to hack something up. The blade is thin though which I suppose allows it to cut easier but flexes a bit too especially if you lay it on it's side. Worth the price though.

4839	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Several months back, I acquired a used Delta Left Tilt Contractor Saw (Model 36-979) that needed some restoration and upgrading.  One vital upgrade was to have a zero-clearance capability.  Like so many before me, I wanted a Leecraft Model DL-1U  -- but in RED for safety reasons.  Having read many reviews here and other places, I realized the fine print that "colors may vary" may not get me the red color I needed. I decided to call one of the Leecraft  outlets and was given the manufacturer's name and phone number.  Ron Lee describes his business "as a one-man operation" in Gainesville, Georgia.  His telephone number is 770-983-1797.  I contacted Ron and was able to acquire several RED "seconds" that have worked out perfectly for me.  Ron has found a niche in the woodworking arena and he makes a superb product. He is extremely conscientious about producing a top quality product for his various customers, including Amazon.  Compared to other Leecraft outlets, Amazon's price is highly competitive!

For the router guide, fense and top OR for the table it sits on?  Yes, this seemed like a neat item and I took the bait.  After hours of putting this thing together and using it make some molding I realized I could have made the same molding by just buying a very good router fence and table top system like one from Kreg (which is what I eventually did.)  Look carefully at the fence and how it works.  Does it have an adjustable outfeed fense?  NO.  Think that the vacuum is going to suck up the sawdust from the top?  NO, it's going to fall down inside the table to cover any tools you got in there.  Working with long boards, is the height adjustable to something else in your shop like the workbench?  NO, you're on your own.

My son in law, several nephews and a couple of nieces are in construction, remodeling, wood and iron crafting.

7220	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had read a review that stated they were using the fine screws for everything. I found that when using soft pine, and more importantly into plywood, the fine screws were on the edge of getting the job done.

7363	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Can't say enough good about this well designed system.  I got it with the table and built my own cabinet into it.  The top is slick (literally, the stock slides right over it w/o resistance).  The fence works very well and the fence slide has a great mm/SAE ruler that is adjustable so you can set the fence with a variety of bit diameters.  The table steel is plenty stable, not that cheap angle stuff you get at the hardware store.  Not cheap, but I got it to keep my fingers.  Don't get it without the feather board (get two for the horizontal table top and two for the fence.  Oddly, the dust collector seems to work quite well.  If you can't let it sit in one place then get the wheels, it's pretty heavy and ungainly (one of the reasons it's so stable, I suppose).

8592	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This machine is yet another good example of high quality Hitachi engineering.  This compressor has outlasted several other brands.  The machine has run two finishing guns continuously for almost a year and  hasn't needed anything more than an oil change The regulator is  predictable, and adjusts as easily as other brands.  I firmly believe that  Hitachi gets 4.1 CFM out of 14.5 amps.  We simply do not run out of air no  matter how fast we are working with the Senco SFN40's.  Down time has  been zilch.  One thing we did add was a water/oil separator and filter to  protect our work and our guns.  I suppose Hitachi (and most other brands)  leaves these off so that they will have a competitive price.  But it does  not make economical sense for YOU to leave them off.

To unfold one you open the feet (or not) and set it on the ground, put one of *your* feet on the "step", reach on each side and unlatch the catches and swing up the vise jaws until they lock on each side.
First, it is a bargain. $30 may seem pricey for a hammer, but assuming you don't lose it, it will last for the rest of your life. Average $30 bucks over thirty years of work. ( or in my case, closer to 45 years. ) Then add to that the years any of your offspring can use it. Damn few products have such a long working lifetime.
I saw first hand the kind of torture Bosch tools could withstand and have been a devoted fan ever since.
Now for the bad. The molded plastic case seems like it doesn't really fit. There are not slots for all the piece and no matter how you put the parts in it doesn't seem quite right. This seems like a pretty obvious mistake so I assume Delta is just too lazy to address this. The setup requires a bit of patience and time. If the bit is not exactly square to the fence you get some wacky looking holes.  Lots of fussy screws, knobs, etc.

2206	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Possibly the biggest piece of junk I've purchased in a long time. Unit is unstable unless the neck is perfectly vertical, which is actually the only position you can use because  the neck cannot stay in any position other than vertical. If you bend the neck it just droops to the ground - it cannot hold any position other than perfectly upright. Total waste of money. I threw it out after my first use.

216	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had one of these before, and it got lost when I moved (or maybe it is still in a box somewhere?).  I'm really happy to have the replacement.  The "neck" holds its shape, and the clip opens wide enough to grab on to things other than a book.  The light is bright, but has a blue cast to it, so it is not blindingly bright in the darkness.
The only down side is that this thing is heavy.  One of my projects involves removing a bunch of material from some walls.  I don't know how long I can hold this heavy beast against a wall though.  On the other hand, horizontal-ish surfaces are super easy because the unit's weight means all I have to do is keep control.

This is not a big deal though, as it is easy to clean out. I would buy this tool again in a heartbeat for its reliability and the value per dollar spent.
16 oz is a good weight for most things. I had my original from school, and that 16 oz helped frame a house, chisel, trim work and much more.  Yes, regardless what you read, this hammer will drive 16 D and 20D nails, it just takes more whacks to sink them than it would with a framing hammer.

4950	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this plate joiner about a year ago, and it has become a regular part of my woodworking activities.  It adjusts easily for doing either straight plunges in a 90-degree edge, or for plunging into a 45-degree  mitered edge.  This is made possible because the fence adjusts to any angle  you would ever need.  The blade goes a long way before it dulls -- I used  mine for at least six months of regular cutting.  The saw has solid  adjustments for bisquit sizes (#0, #10, and #20, as well as a kind of  "open-ended" size that I don't really understand very well) --  you just have to turn a little knob until it clicks into a clearly marked  bisquit-size setting.  It handles better than other plate joiners, since  the body is longer and the handle is in a better location relative to the  mouth.  There are clear, red lines on two places on the plate joiner to  align with your bisquit marks, whether you are using the machine  horizontally or vertically.  The only negative I have to point out about  this plate joiner is that it doesn't have a great dust-collection system,  and also dust collects in the blade opening a little more than other plate  joiners I tested.  Every four or five plunges you have to either vacuum out  the dust, or run the machine in the open air for a second to clear it.  This is a small matter when you consider how nice the finished bisquit  joints look.
6759	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Don't get these guides if you're planning on using 1/8" blades.  These guides are great for resawing and heavy cutting where you're going to use a wide blade, but you can't use thin blades on these guides, so you can forget making really tight turns (as in cutting a bandsaw box or when doing tight scrolling).  Plus, the price of these guides will leave a sore spot where your wallet used to be.

I can compare this drill directly to several models I own from competitive vendors, including a 1980's era Porter Cable 1/2 drill, and 1990's era B&D Industrial/DeWALT 1/2 drills.

Most manufacturers make their saws to within three thousandths ( front-to-back) tolerance. That's OK and good enough for rough carpentry with free-hand cuts. But after any amount of use, all such saws get banged out of alignment, so that 3-thou tolerance quickly fades. That causes burn-marks, rough cuts, premature blade wear and dangerous kickbacks.

Con:
I had some reservations about the lid staying tight, as it just sits loosely on top of the bucket.  Flipping the bucket handle up over the lid holds it in place, but doesn't seal it.  That happens when you turn on the vacuum.  It creates a tight seal and I haven't noticed any problems with air or sawdust leaking out.  The ports also fit snugly around 2 1/2 inch hoses.
5631	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Combined with a "plumbing-dept" rubber pipe connector, these work well for all my shop tools. The plumber connectors are the key as they are available for every standard size port you might need. They come as 2:2 or 2.5:2 or 2:3.0 etc. They use a clamp on each end so the ports are tight and right. Order several at once or you pay more for freight than the tool !!

9983	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just finished a 14x16' cedar deck working alone and this tool was a great help in securing the proper spacing. Provided the 3rd hand I needed using the Camo hidden fastener system on 16' 5/4 decking. Let me put the boards just where I needed them for proper spacing. There is a bit of a learning curve knowing where to place the BoWrench to lock it place. Took me @ 4 boards before I placed it consistently. Saved me a lot of work once I got the hang of it.

Just a followup note:  One of the primary benefits of these reviews is to alert other potential customers to salient issues.  Based upon the number of forum comments, it would seem that buying one of these, only to find they aren't fully functional on a specific table saw is not an uncommon issue.  When, as I did, customers consult point of purchase materials, Amazon promotional write-ups, and tablesaw manuals without finding any illumination on the topic, its probably a point others would like to know.  That said, I still think this Dado is excellent for those with the appropriate platform.
Contrary to the instructions included with the tool...--read this carefully--There are little adjustable rails on the left and right side of the disc. The rails can be lowered and raised to adjust the angle of attack of the disc. I found that the "cutting" side rail (leading edge rail) of the grinder needs to be set to about 1/16 inch above the grinding disc (leaving 1/16th inch of exposed disc to do the cutting) and the back side rail (trailing edge rail) needs to be about 1/16 of an inch TALLER than the total depth of the paint you are removing. (The back rail should ride along the painted surface, keeping the trailing edge of the disc off of the paint by 1/16th inch.) In my case I am removing approximately 1/8 inch of paint (typical for an 80 year old house). Therefore the trailing edge rail should be set 3/16th lower than the disc, leaving the trailing edge of the cutting disc suspended, by the rail, about 1/16th inch above the painted surface. The cutting edge (leading edge) of the disc is exposed, preventing the rail from riding along the painted surface, about 1/16th of an inch.
6761	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Looking at these, you would think that they should work well, but they don't. They have no clamping tension and cannot be tightened enough to hold anything firmly. If you need a clamp that fits loosely, these will work. My recommendation is to keep looking for another product.

3417	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	They work as they should but i made changes to them to make them better by opening up the slot to the end so they can be removed without backing out the unnecessarily long threads on the lock knob that comes with the stops.. There are times when removing them during crown installation is needed, this makes it easy to remove and re-install them. Hint: put a pencil line on the base to show the position of the stops so they can be quickly put back on. Also on my 1 year old 12" dual bevel Dewalt saw they did not work with the the 6.25 inch crown I was installing because they would not move out far enough. I solved that by drilling and tapping another hole in the side of the saw base. There are other ways to cut crown, but I prefer the method that requires placing the crown on the saw base on an angle. These stops are a great help for that.
4255	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very pleased with the look, the fit, and the performance of this product.  I was somewhat confused with the labeling of the shims.  The package labeling uses inches, the shims themselves are labeled in mm.  The chart I found on-line was much clearer.  Also, I would like to have seen the shims labeled in such a way that it would be less difficult to read the sizes.  Not a big problem - I can certainly do that for myself.  I haven't used them enough to know if it was a good idea to save a few bucks on the 6" rather than purchasing the 8".

The three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs, such as the Leigh jig.  It's possible to modify them to work with these jigs, by hack-sawing the excess length off the offending guides, flatten the cut end on a grinder and sanding the edge smooth.  A no-cost approach.

4009	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Fein brand blades last longer than the generics, but they cost more.  This is a very functional design, I use this as well as the e-cut precision blades.  I like this style because I can keep turning it to an area with sharp teeth.  Nothing like a sharp tool when you need it, I like to keep a back up blade handy.  I use it for everything from cutting shims flush with the wall when installing doors, to sawing fiberglass during boat repairs.  It doesn't get into corners as well as the e-cut, but it does better on long cuts.  It is thin and bends easily, but can be straightened out quickly.

I don't think this drill is for everybody though. If you upgrade tools regularly because you prefer the latest in high-tech features, this drill is basically the opposite of what you want because it's very simple and will last forever denying the excuse to upgrade.

With that said, this is still the best unit available for purchase that I've found. The hand grip is very comfortable, it's fairly quiet, and the vibration is low enough to not cause numbness after extended periods of sanding. Because of the price I'm giving the new 330 4 stars, although I'd have given it 5 if they kept everything the same from the old 330.
I believe that the Jorgensen clamp is  better built and offers better value.  If possible, it would be nice to see some of the design elements of the Bessey included in this clamp and even better finish, although between the two I prefer the Jorgensen and believe that it offers better value.
My past tools have been Bosch, Milwaukee, and Dewalt.  But I bought Makita's top of line 18V saw and drill and was very impressed.  Bought this based on that experience and great reviews.  Very satisfied.
1695	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem, but not its other fault, difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place.
8495	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The best
6799	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The 1/8" of play that several people have complained about is easily solved.  It took me a while to find this out, but the locking lever has THREE positions.  When the lever is above guide, the clamp is unlocked.  When the lever is parallel with the guide, the clamp is locked but the guide can wiggle about 1/8".  Some people stop here and think the wiggle is a defect.  But the lever has a THIRD position, below the guide.  In this position, all the slop is gone.  When the guide is new, it is sometimes difficult to get the lever in this third position.  You may have to press down on the handle.

3615	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Milwaukee makes great tools. I did a lot of research on right angle medium duty drills and here is what I found. The Makita for slightly more money has: A more powerful 4-amp motor instead of the 3.5, while still maintaining a slightly lighter operating weight. (3.1 lbs, instead of 3.5) An LED light brightening the way that is guaranteed to last the lifetime of the tool. Variable speed of 0-2400 instead of 0-1300. Also the Makita has a speed-limiting dial to prevent over tightening of fasteners. Also the Makita has only a 2 5/8" head height instead of 4 1/2" for right angle drilling when working deeper than the first few inches of your project. For close to the edge work, the Milwaukee has a small head height, but if you need to go deeper into the project beyond a few inches, the angled body creates a 4 1/2" height, and that is for making 55 degree angle applications, if you need to make a 90 degree hole, you have to tilt the body, making the overall head height out of control. Look at the picture to see what I mean. For making joist holes in 2x10s this is not a problem because their is plenty of clearance, but if you are making cabinetry, and for example want to secure drawer guides in drawer openings, that are closed panels, the Milwaukee will not get the job done.
3785	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	great
I used it to refinish an old wood deck.  While time consuming, it wasn't hard work, as this sander weighs enough where you only need to guide it rather than push down as well.
Product features The RIDGID 18-inch aluminum pipe wrench is designed almost any type of pipe work a professional or DIY homeowner has to do. It's made from aluminum and weighs only 3.75 pounds, which means it is approximately 40 percent lighter than 18-inch cast-iron wrenches, which reduces fatigue from using it for a long time. Its average 18-inch length makes it possible to store the wrench easily in most common-sized tool boxes as well. This aluminum straight pipe wrench can be used on any pipe with a capacity of up to 2.5 inches. It's compatible with special heel jaws and hooks, which allow it to work with softer plastic-coated pipes. Since it's made from aluminum this wrench is immune to rust and many other types of corrosion.

- It comes more-or-less set up.  It's always a little disheartening to open up your new tool to discover a bunch of metal bits and a few baggies of screws.  You can make some sawdust within a few minutes of opening the box.  It did take some adjustment to get it to where I was ready to *use* it, but nothing major.  A minor point, but still pleasing.
If you find yourself crawling around on the floor with lights behind the blade running the adjustment screws up/down over and over till your back aches from all the stooping and bending you might ask yourself, as I did, why did I buy this thing?

I have a dedicated shop and I don't usually need to move the saw other than to clean around it but I have found times when it was easier to move the saw than work around it and this base works great.  Was a little skeptical at first due to the position of the lifting wheel but it handles the weight of the saw, outfeed and extension tables well and is solid.  Assembled it in my garage originally and then had to move it into my shop months later when construction was done.  Actually had to roll it over the lawn on plywood sheets.  Rolled easily and very stable.  Great mobile base.  Don't waste your money on a universal base for this machine.

3450	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said "Drywall and Deck" Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill.

7599	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you do woodworking, you know that sanding is the most dreadful part of any project.  Sanding is usually a dirty, dusty, and unhealthy job.  When my last random-orbit sander got worn out, I replaced it with the 6" Fein MSF636-1.  I also bought the Fein Turbo II dust collector to go with it.  I am so impressed, I just had to sing its praises...

I also love that these Mighty-Bright 2-Lights run on AAA batteries, which are inexpensive, easy to replace, last a long time, and you can even get rechargeable AAA batteries these days.  This is in sharp contrast to booklights that run on button-shaped batteries which I've found to be unreliable, don't last very long, and that their power gradually fades so that most of the time the booklight doesn't produce a crisp (or even usable) amount of light. And those button-shaped batteries are expensive and not rechargeable.
Great product.  Great value for the price.
6704	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The biggest flaw of this clamp is that it utilizes zero leverage in the design. Because of this, the clamp will only be as tight as you can squeeze it with your hands and nothing more. This is in contrast to more effective clamps that maximize clamping pressure by taking advantage of a pistol grip handle 'trigger' or a screw set fastener riding on a lock rail.

6729	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	So far, so good. The clamp works well for light and moderate work. It certainly doesn't have the power that you would expect from ViseGrip pliers, but it clamps woodwork in place snugly. It's lightweight and easy to handle. I'm happy with it and will order a few more!

This device works from the edge and one side. You don't have to bore from both sides of the door. Also, bore the edge bore to full depth first. That way there is less material for the 2-1/8" bit to remove and it goes faster.

3540	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought two of these to finish building my house.  My thoughts were to keep one at a particular angle and the other at an opposite angle so I could make cuts quickly and eliminate setup between cuts.  In theory it seems logical.  In use, it wasn't practical because the need for minor adjustments.  I installed my own trim which included baseboard and door casings, all custom milled.  Turns out, very few corners were "square" so I ended up having to adjust each and every piece to fit.  This meant that I needed to cut slightly off 90 degrees and perhaps a bit of a toe in or toe out (don't know what you would call that), but not just straight!  So it meant that I needed to adjust slightly with almost every cut. Adjusting is simple and it locks down solidly.
I highly recommend this set if you do remodeling, or need it for farm building repair the way we do.

The snap in rings are strong and rigid. They snap in real tight.

Sadly, this is the best lightweight inline cordless screwdriver I could find. To be perfect this tool needs five things. First, a carry case. None is included or available. Second, a modern battery. This tool uses nickel cadmium batteries, which are large (relatively) and suffer from memory effects. Any high performance cordless device should have nickel metal hydride or lithium ion batteries, which could make this tool smaller, lighter, and give improved battery life. Third, I want a screwdriver that has continuously variable speed like that is common on many cordless drills (but not screwdrivers).This tool is just on or off, in high or low gear. Fourth, and minor, it comes with only 2 philips head bits. Strangely, no slotted bits (or any other bits at all) are included. Fifth, it should have a compartment that would accommodate 1 or 2 bits on board the tool like many cordless drills do.

Poor instructions - Although it was not mentioned in the relatively meager instructions, there are hex nuts that you can adjust to square the fence that are hidden on the inside of the fence.  It took me a few weeks to figure that one out.  Perhaps if I was a table saw pro I would have known that but why not include it in the instructions guys...why?
2170	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this saw back in 1999. Since then it's mostly done decking - cutting 5/4x6 3 at a time and pressure treated 2x10 2 at a time really makes life quick. I've also done 2x4s 9 at a time (3 high and 3 deep). The saw never complained once, even on two hundred feet of extension cord. Its also pulled double duty cutting 3" aluminum square tubing and 1/2 inch by 6 inch aluminum plate. The saw is a hairy beast. If you're primarily a framer or do decks, there's no better saw, period. I did burn out the armature once, but that was sawing through 3" steel pipe with an abrasive blade. Not difficult to replace, and I should have picked up a cheap abrasive saw or used my recip saw, but the Dewalt had done everything else I'd ever asked, and it did get through about 15 of them.
If you are looking for a good, sturdy flashlight head to run on your Dewalt 18v batteries, this one will work. It is not the brightest or the lightest on the market, but the price and utility are right. If, like us, that is what you seek - then I recommend this light to you.

On the Dado set, I noticed the reviewers stating that their was a tiny ridge at the bottom of the dado cut, created with the Forrest. The Freud has similar results. Oddly enough the Freud creates a perfect edge when making finger joints and the like, even though when you look down into the pocket, their are miniscule ridges in the cut. Comments that the end result on the Forrest have me concerned, stating that the edge is not perfect. Is this an example of more expensive must be better syndrome?
8864	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is my first ever dado blade set.  It is on my Ridgid 4512 10-inch table saw.  I installed the blade and built it out to 3/4" as I believe that's about the max width I'll use on a dado cut.  It cuts perfectly in conjunction with a Leecraft Zero Clearance Insert.  I find the cuts to be quite flat on the bottom as do many other reviewers of this item.  The photo of this item is not correct.  It is actually silver rather than black.  the big box store "Big Orange" sells the exact same blade but theirs is red and carries Diablo as its name.  It is model DD208.
Should it be cheaper?  It used to sell for $ 34.00 and now costs $20.00.
4018	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a decent quality Makita tool and it performs fine within the limits of abrasive cutting.  Stick with quarter inch bar and angle stock, half inch square and round and you will be happy.  Larger stock will have you watching sparks for a long time.  If you have to make a lot of angle changes on the vice and backing plate you will be cursing the design that requires two bolts to be loosened and the poorly marked angle marks - a tooless design would be a vast improvement.  This is a good tool if you only cut small stuff or if you aren't making a lot of cuts.  If I had it to do again I would spend the $400 for a cold saw.

Once assembled, it is immediately evident that this is a very  solid table.  It has a good weight to it, and does not move a bit with the router running.  There is really no need to clamp it down, but the table is designed to do so if desired.  There is also a slot in the base that will fit a horizontal 2x4 for added stability, if desired, on a work bench.  The removable router platform easily fit my Porter-Cable 890 router, and there are many other pre-drilled holes to fit other routers.  A handy reference is provided to show which holes correspond with which routers.  There is no platform sagging with the router hanging from it.  The fence is easily adjustable, stable, flat, and can also be used for simple jointing with included spacer rods.  The front door of the table/cabinet can be opened easily to access the router.  There is a standard metal miter slot in front that can be used to hold jigs, featherboards, etc.

My uniguard arrived in  a rather heavy, long narrow box with 1/4" plywood backing.  Set up is  relatively straightforward, and takes about an hour.  Depending on your  saw, you may have to drill a couple of holes in the underside of your  extension table to mount the bracket, but that is a pretty simple  procedure.  Another pair of hands is useful in holding the big black bar  while mounting (it gets pretty heavy while trying to adjust it) but I  managed to do it alone.  The instructions caution against having the power  cord from the table saw motor come in contact with the guard.  On my saw  (Delta 10" contractors platinum edition) this clearance is very tight,  but there is no rubbing of the cord.

2864	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have always trusted Dewalt products and this flashlight didn't disappoint. It's the brightest flashlight I've ever owned and it runs for about an hour on a fully charged battery. I've been using it almost daily for two months and it seems very durable, I've already dropped it off my 6 foot ladder a few times and it just keeps going strong. The flat bottom and swivel head design make it an excellent work light, just set it down and angle the head to shine where you need it, freeing up both hands to do the job.
It is so much better than the average 7 " consumer saw that I can't even find the words to describe it.
I've had a 42000 template guide kit since the mid 1990's.  The set works OK, but my advice is to buy another brand.  The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators.  In addition, after a dozen years or so, every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows, pits and all. It's not clear why this happened, since they've never been outside the basement workshop, and no other tools corroded.  The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts. Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion, but the pieces still look dreadful.
3776	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a good quality blade and at a fair price. At 24t you get a decent cut. I haven't used mine on the job but,it has seen it's fair share of projects around my home shop, without complaints. I do recommend this blade, the quality is there and the price is right. As I do with all my blades I wipe them clean after use and spray on a light coat of( dri-cote) they won't rust and it reduces cutting friction. Now get out there and cut something.
3828	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Awesome.  I bought one after I saw Norm Abram use his.  This is awesome.  It makes my router so easy to handle.  I'll never go back to a standard base.
Be with out this Hitachi Router! It gives you one more ace in your deck!
2827	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I discovered this blade via the amateur boatbuilding community. The thin kerf design means that the blade has to remove less wood to make a cut than do traditional blades, and that means your saw doesn't have to work as hard, and can cut much faster. One trick used by a lot of boatbuilders is to use a hand held curricular saw with this blade for cutting curves in plywood: Set the blade for a very shallow cut, just deep enough to cut through the wood. You'll find that you can follow gentle curves and make much smoother cuts than you could with a hand-held scroll saw.
All this for the same price (or less) than the junk hoses other companies offer!!!
7147	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have come to discover that the quality of the blade is every bit as important as the quality of the saw.  This blade is giving me glass smooth cuts with no tear-out.  Before getting this blade I used my miter saw strictly for cutting rough lumber.  Now I am happy to cut even very expensive wood -- it is a joy to use with woods like padouk and mahogany.  The one possible down side is that with all those teeth it does cut a bit slower than my old blade.  I can't just slap a 2X4 down and drop the blade through it, but that's a small price to pay for the cut quality.

2125	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Purchased to go along with the DW744XRS I also got from amazon.  They have saved me several times trying to do larger projects without taking up the space of a full blown outfeed table.  Having read the other reviews of the side support falling out and hitting the ground while wheeling the saw around, I installed the mounts for the side supports angled ever so slightly pointed inward.  This way when the support is slid all the way in, it wedges itself there ever so slightly.  This has kept the side support from falling out even when wheeled over rough ground or over large bumps (door thresholds and what not).  Hope this helps.

I recommend it.  It's absolutely worth the few extra dollars over the cheaper hoses out there.  If you're often in a high action area where boards can fall on it regularly, you might want to look into something armored, and maybe use a flex hose on the final 10 feet.  But I've never had any trouble with mine.  I do keep a little emergency splice kit with me, just in case. But I've never needed to use it.

The fence can be a little tough to adjust, as it tightens with a wing nut on each end of a threaded rod.  You must turn both ends at the same time to get a tight grip.  I find that I use it without the fence most of the time.  The blade is mounted such that it hits the middle of 3/4" stock just sliding on the base.  I clamp my work to the extension table on my table saw and just slide the biscuit joiner on the table surface.  It is easy to hit your marks on edge joints this way.  For right angle joints, I use a guide clamp (like a Tru-Grip CT24C) squared on the workpiece (i.e. the side of a bookcase) so the base of the joiner rests where the bottom of the shelf will be.  It is easy to make a verticle plunge into the board resting on the table.

7386	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought 10.  Well made.  East to assemble.  I used 18" galvanized pipe sections easy to get at any hardware store to avoid rusting.  I added a schedule 80 PVC pipe cap on the threaded end to protect it and setting this end on the concrete floor avoids moisture pickup.  They look and work great.
Here is the bottom line.  It is ...[not expensive] and it works amazingly well, so basically if you don't have one get one.
I find the easiest way to use it is to nail the back side of the stud into place, then use the Tweaker to move the front side into alignment and nail it.
 Search "brass template guide set" and be amazed at the difference in price and the fact of the quality of these "no-brand" guides. Occasionally you may need to shine them up a little, but being solid brass, that's not a big problem. I've used both steel and brass on door hinge templates, dovetail templates, stair tread templates and strike plate templates. Brass just slides easier, smoother. On dovetail templates, especially plastic and soft aluminum the brass guides show less wear on the surfaces that the guides contact.

6904	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this bag for my Bonsai tools.  Many are cutters or one sort or another, so it was really important to have a bag with a lot of tool pockets.  (The last thing I want to do is reach into a bag & grab the wrong end of my shears!)
2094	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Meets or exceeds all expectations as a quality product.  Fits my Porter Cable 591 router as expected. I would buy again
I've since purchased an aluminum plate that fits my 9" x 12" opening and it works wonderfully. It costs twice as much as this Rousseau but more than makes up for the trouble.

7977	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This workbench allows the small front part to be moved to a vertical position but actually that also makes the standard horizontal position less stable. I am not sure how the plastic guides that maintain the middle and back panes are going to hold over time. This looks a little bit cheap and would probably not sustain any intensive usage.
1400	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used these over the years to replace landscape spotlights and they work fine. They obviously won't last forever but at (10) bulbs for $6.32 they last more than enough time before you need to reorder so you can't go wrong.
852	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good value and they work fine. Remains to be seen how long they last. Low power consumption is the real motivation.
9522	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'd never used a drill bit that had a built in countersink before.  This is so handy.  I used to need two drills to drill the hole and to drill the countersink.  I love it.  Mine did come missing one set screw but since I only use one bit at a time I am able to just move a set screw from a different bit.  It works.
If you get the D-handle base as  part of a package, it's obviously cheaper, but if not, I'd still recommend  considering it.
If you buy one of these, try it!  Don't let it set around like I did and get past the return date.  Fairly obvious that whoever had it before me realized it would not work consistantly, and returned it.
If I had a negative, it would be the that joiner "jumps" across the face of the work when the motor starts...  you have to make a very conscious effort to hold it in place, but once you get the hang of that it's fine.  Beyond that, I think you would be nitpicking to find anything truly negative to say.

3712	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've owned/used several belt sanders over the last couple of years.  This is one of the best.  Powerful, somewhat heavy but well balanced. Because it is somewhat heavy and powerful, I save this for the tough wood, like oak or cocobolo.  (I have a Bosch with a sanding frame that is awesome for finish or delicate work.) The motor does run hot, as another reviewer noted.  The dust collection bag works darn well for what it is.

I also use it as a night light in the trailer, if I need to get up in the middle of the night.  I just clip it to the window valance.  Gives off good light for reading.  I like the fact it has 2 settings, so you can click it twice for a dimmer "night light."

8874	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this after using the detail saw for a number of projects.  The finer side works well, and cuts plenty fast.  The other side is completely useless though.  The teeth are way to aggressive and just end up binding unless you use the lightest of pressure.  Doing it with that tiny of a cut means it takes longer to make the cut than just flipping it over and using the finer teeth.

8216	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this for wood and metal working
Saw does get up to speed a bit slow, and it does throw sawdust around. It helps to practice a bit and to use the sharpest, finest blade you can for the work at hand. It's tempting to let the motor do all the work, but stick with good sense and let the proper blade do the work.

The bench dogs work well but only for limited size pieces. I guess if you're a model builder you'll be OK, but anything bigger than a jewelry box will have issues with it. It's also too small to use as a sit down bench. It has worked well as a small outfeed table for my table saw but for that I could've just used a sawhorse. Bottom line is take the $90 you'd spend on this, buy yourself some wood, and build something bigger, better, and more stable than this thing. If you don't want to do that, buy yourself a small kitchen cabinet and screw a top onto it. You'll have a much more stable and functional work surface.
6513	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Okay -- I'm not a pro, but not an amateur either....  I've done cabinets without this tool and I just did one with this tool.  There is no comparison!  This tool makes hanging cabinets a BREEZE!  You can get the cabinet faces lined up very nicely, drill and counter-sink your screws, pull the cabinet claws and you're done.  This tool makes this job SOOOOOOO easy!  As some reviews have said -- you're a bit "blind" when you drill the holes because you can't really see into the drill holes/guides.  However, as long as your drill is straight and you take the time to mark your drill bit you won't have to worry about the big coming out of the face of the cabinet or thru the other side.



3346	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Could not ask for a better add-on to my chop saw. What was I thinking these last 42 years as a contractor without it?

The first thing I noticed removing the blades from the case was how big the carbide teeth are on the main blades. The alternating bevel teeth are big, but the main chipper looks huge. Installing the blades, the shaft hole fits snug but doesn't catch like some of my old blades. The shims require a little patience as the thinnest ones can fall in the shaft threads, but from my experience that's just the facts of life. It cuts effortlessly, clean, and smooth. I'm satisfied overall, with only two small issues. First is, the smallest dado you can cut is a full 1/4" (using just one blade), which makes my drawer bottoms a little sloppy. I want a little clearance for expansion, but this is too much. I tried using one chipper blade as they're thinner, but that's not what they're designed for and it splintered the wood. Of course this has more to do with modern plywood dimensions, but dado manufacturers know the industry trends. Second, while there is a good assortment of shims for a wide variety of widths, I would like to see included in the set a 1/16" chipper. I have one in my old set and it seems like I used it in almost every setup I encountered. I don't know if even more expensive sets include them or maybe they're a thing of the past. And I know the shims give an almost infinite variety of widths. But after 30 plus years of using one, it was my go-to blade. I consider these minor nuisances, and the plus factor of beefy carbide teeth clearly outweighs my narrow dado issue.

I haven't tried them, yet, on my router table as I have a Panel-Loc there.  I think these would great for rails and stiles which the Panel-Loc won't handle well. I'll edit this review in the future and let you know how they worked.
One word of warning to the casual user - Remember that this is a professional level tool. The instructions assume you're a pro.  You won't just pick this thing up and start using it like a pro.
4812	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This fits my unisaw perfectly and works like a champ.  The instructions are very clear and it is easy to cut the blade slot.  Mine is used for a dado blade.  Great addition to my saw.

4634	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Having used plate joiners in the past..I found the Dewalt to perform very well.  The adjustments are straight forward and the streamline handle make it easy to use on all materials.  The handle is very important, as some other designs have a bulky handle that may be to far offset from the plane of the blade.  With the Dewalt you can hold the outside area of the fence steadyand easily start  the motor and push it in with the other hand.  I find the #20 plates/biscuits as my standby, when attaching 3/4" materials to 3/4" plywood (face-frames to cabinet box)  The #10 when less of a bit is needed and #0 for thin materials....I recommend this tool....so far I have been very happy with all of the Dewalt products I've purchased and used...
8668	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Having never owned a stacked Dado, I found myself puzzled on how to place the blades and spacers on the table saw. The package is of little help, other than to show you the combinations of thicknesses in a rather cryptic chart. I turned to YouTube for help. So, instead of Freud posting how-to videos on using what you've already lined their pocket to own, they tend to focus on marketing more wares to you. After an hour of searching and watching stacked dado blade videos I finally determined that there is no real answer to my question. You simply have to use common sense. Place the blades on the arbor and space them out so the teeth don't hit adjacent cutting teeth and spread the inner blades out so as to keep it balanced. If you need to use spacers to get an exact thickness, spread them out as evenly as possible. Once I started cutting the blades performed very well. As I don't have a comparable experience, I thought the blades performed as expected, very clean cut.
5531	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Ok like that others have said this is meant to be used inside a 4 inch hose - but you could do as I did and used an old 4 inch rubber plumbing collar I cut it down down to size then used the clamps to hold it on to this and the dust port on my ridgid table saw and it works like a charm.
  Several reviews complained about the dust collection bag.  They are right.  This bag is a joke.  For every pound of sawdust generated the bag collects about an ounce.  I would strongly recommend hooking the saw up to a vacuum system.  I purchased a Shop-Vac 906-85-00 2.5" to 1.25" Conversion Unit for $4.99 on Amazon.  The 1.25" end fits snuggly in the Bosch saw and the 2.5" end fits the end of the hose on my Shop-Vac.  The conversion unit also fits my Bosch router.  The saw sprays much less sawdust when you use the vacuum.  Although, there is still spillage.
8515	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a professional builder, but I have put in a lot of hours on home improvements on my house, including a few week-long sessions working with a crew doing an addition on my house. So while I may not have as much experience as a pro, I have pounded more than enough nails to get a good idea of what I like, and I really like this hammer. While a professional framer might use a heavier hammer, like something in the 22 ounce range, this one is just perfect for me. It's well balanced, drives straight, very comfortable to hold, and as far as I can tell, indestructible. Everyone who picked it up liked it- including one of the framing crew we had to chase down to get it back- but that's another story.

3760	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this stabilizer to mount on my DeWalt dw746 tablesaw.  I had been using a DeWalt 5" stabilizer plate with a Forrest WWII thin kerf blade.  At 5" in diameter, the DeWalt stabilizer effectively limited my depth of cut to about 2.5".  After trying out the Freud 3.5" stabilizer, I can honestly say that I didn't lose any noticeable performance, and I gained enough blade clearance to once again rip/crosscut 3" stock.
8226	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great.

These Leecraft inserts are, in fact, dead flat. So it took only about two minutes to adjust them to the table height and snug fit them with the side screws. Now I can go back to measuring mortise side cut blade height off the insert rather than my jig to get the height gauge base over to the cast iron top. Sweet.

It keeps your hands free, provides lots of light, and lasts a long time.

All in all, I would challenge anyone to find a better value in a sliding compound miter saw.
5713	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just picked up a used (barely) Protop Contractor Table and I must say that for what I paid for it, I feel I should be arrested for theft. What a table, rock solid, smooth, not too heavy but heavy enough. This is a quality made tool that is simple to operate. I didn't even have to drill any holes for my Makita RF1101 router kit. I can install either the plunge base or the fixed base, the holes are already there. Everything is there on this table, an awesome pro fence that allows for multi adjustments and router table jointing. T-track on the front for miter gauge, feather board or homemade jigs. Exhaust port and finger protector are all adjustable for different positions. I do plan on building a Cabinet Base on caster wheals so I will have portability around the shop and if need to just disconnect the table from the base and put in the truck if/when I have to go mobile.
My advice if you want a *good* WorkMate? Find one of the old originals in the aisles of everyone's favorite auction site or score one from a garage or estate sale. As long as people keep buying the cheap Chinese-made junk U.S. tool manufacturers are footing ...the manufacturers will keep making cheap Chinese-made junk.

It's very convenient when you want to drill and countersink in one motion, and then sink the screw.  You don't have to change from a more typical drill/countersink bit to a separate crewdriver bit.  Just twist the collar on the stud that mounts in your drill chuck, and reverse the drill bit, and you have the right screwdriver bit for the size screw you've drilled for.
Machine Quality - Just fine.  No problems.  Some have called it flimsy.  I don't get it.  Runs quietly, without vibration.

530	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a Kindle and love it. I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.
Original review (2002):

3202	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This product works as intended.

8649	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Sturdy construction, works well.
3722	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	If I have but one complaint about this saw, it is that they need to put the blade on the left side.  That's it.
Another note: I wondered if the 22" height would be too tall for a 29" high table. The 22" height is to the top of the fence. The router table is 16-" above my 29" high table. I find this 45-46" height a very comfortable height to work on. No bending over.

The saw does have a softer side, and its reasonably good for finish work and woodworking. Admittedly its a bit overkill for cutting trim. 12" finish blades are really pricey, so if I was a cabinetmaker or a finish contractor I'd get a 10" slider. If you only plan to buy one chop saw, and primarily do bigger stuff, this is the one to get.

Jet had better fix this problem, fast, or they will see their customer base shrink down to zero.

  I did have one minor issue that was easily tweaked. Not infrequently, and the beginning and end of a run, there would be a little divot in the wood surface. I put a thin piece of cardboard under the metal plate which is on the work surface side of the machine. This helped a lot and now my finishes are nearly flawless, needing only a little finishing from the random orbital sander.

It is a good blade.  Is it worth 2 or 3 times the cost of the Freud?  Not to me.
5106	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I resisted buying a Forrest blade due to cost. Then I saw (pun intended) a great sale on amazon and went for it. Best blade I've ever used. Crosscuts are smooth as glass, rip cuts are a dream. Just make sure your table saw blade is parallel to the fence and the miter gauge. This blade has cut everything I've thrown at it flawlessly; hardwood, veneers, A1 plywood, melamine, you name it, and it excels at it. Watch amazon.com for blade sales, well worth it.

4968	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this belt sander to sand the 4x4s for my grandkids swing set.  We got a 50 grit paper and used it for a few hours to sand off the slivers and roughness.  The power is great, it's smooth and not very loud.  The belt adjustment is precise and the belt tracks well.  My son in law tried to sand the cord.  This was the end of our sanding for the day.  I got to take apart the sander.  First I had to get the cord out that was run up in the sander.  I will tell you that the mechanical parts are solid and well built.  Top of the line.  The screws all screw into the metal body so you can tighten them back down snug.  The rollers have a 7/8" nut shaped cone inside so I was able to use a rachet to back out the entangled cord.  The cord was not cut, but I feared it might be internally damaged after being severely pinched.  So I ended up shortening the cord.  This was no problem since it has a sturdy very long cord.  The layout and connections in the switch and neutral where great.  It was very easy to reinstall the slightly shorter cord.  When I restarted the sander I realized that the drive was not working properly.  So I flipped the sander on it's side and removed the cover to the belt.  I feared the motor or gears might be messed up.  I was delighted to find that some of the cogs on the rubber belt had been stripped away when the cord suddenly stopped the sander.  So rather than replacing the motor or broken gears, I replaced a $7 drive belt.  Overall the design and implementation of the sand is excellent.  It is designed and built to last.  This is something you don't find in many power tools today.  Kudos to Makita.  I look forward to using the sander for years to come.

Upon arrival I was immediately impressed with the quality of the components.  Everything included in the box feels good (no cheap plastic parts...).
As for these clamps, they are absolutely a joy to use. The clamp faces are wonderfully non-marring and resistant to glue sticking. They also will stand up by themselves and don't easily rack and fall over as I slide boards across them. Once a panel is in the clamps, the whole piece can be stood on the end of the clamps in a corner while the glue dries.

  I am impressed with the quality of the level. It's easy to zero in and accuate once set. I found that even the pitch was very accurate. I can see that if I was a builder by profession, this would be a great addition to my daily used tools.
