It is true that these games are not the sturdiest; They require children exercise care and caution.  You have to expect them to put the game pieces awat nicely, but we have had no problem with that, even with children who aren't always perfectly well behaved. The boxes themselves, though, are actually very sturdy and of much better quality than you'd find from more mainstream companies.  Also, if you get a bunch of these Family Pastimes games, they stack beautifully and are quite inviting for children to chose from. Likewise, I find the homespun aesthetics of these games and the artwork quite appealing, much more satisfying than some of the more overproduced stuff out there.

I buy some of the merchandise (games, plush, etc.), but sometimes feel that the spirit of his work gets lost. I do not feel that this is the really the case with this Fluxx game though.
XCOM is a game of you versus the seemingly endless horde of creepy aliens looking to be jerks. They will fly in with UFO's and send minions into your base to kill you, all in an effort to raise panic levels of the mindless masses of Earth. When the panic level of those masses gets too high, everyone freaks out and the world is turned into one giant ball of violence that puts Black Friday to shame, and you lose. The minion aliens could also break your base and you lose. As this is XCOM...be prepared to lose a few times. As with the video game, the board game will make you pay for making mistakes.

The confidence that this product purports to instill into young learners is truthful. This in itself makes the product a step above many other tools I have used to teach youngsters (I am a specialist in teaching learners with developmental delays). In the process, he is also learning critical thinking skills and basic building blocks on which phonemic awareness, basic math skills, and problem-solving skills are founded.
There's a short version and a long version.  The short version takes the 3 of us an hour.  It's a well made game.  Our biggest complaint is the narrator's voice.  It is supposed to be "Carlisle" from Twilight but it just sounds like, as my son puts it, "Some guy sounding fake English."

Ticket to Ride is a refreshingly fun game that is great for the entire family, or a group of adults for that matter. It is a quick game to learn, even a novice can have the hang of it in 15 minutes. Select your missions, draw your cards, and lay tracks across the US to begin racking up points. The game play moves rapidly enough to keep it from getting boring and there is some strategy involved but not enough to make it tedious.

Prior to conflict you do what's called an Edge Battle where you basically discard cards one at a time in hopes of getting more Force icons than your opponent (the downside is you lose those cards), and this fun bit of bluffing and jockeying is for the all-important "edge" of going first when combat resolves, then you alternate as either sides characters attack each other and opposing objectives. Between turn actions you resolve a Force Struggle, where both sides compare characters "committed" to their struggle to see if anyone gets a force bonus to their cause: Dark Side is basically trying to get to 12 of their Death Star turn marker while Light Side is trying to destroy 3 Dark Side objectives before that happens. These combined with the cards themselves, the Units, locations, events, all add up to a giving a story-like feel to the game that's just fantastic. If you like Star Wars, this game is for you...you'll like it even more. If you're one of the few that don't (why are you reading this?) but you enjoy a well-made, really fun card game then this is also for you.

7344	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Awesome learning tool
Medium.  At least when Ive taught people the idea of tapping a card to affect the roll before or after it happens seems to be a sticking point, mostly because there are only two kinds of cards that go before a roll and you are used to tapping all the rest of the cards after you roll.  Once you get past that, then theres the analysis paralysis for those who struggle with the idea of multiple routes to victory.  Which of all those cards should I try to get?  Happily the opening options are limited.  The options increase as people warm up to the game- hopefully getting the hang of it.

Not only does this give the classic game a twist L. Frank Baum would be proud of, but the actual gameplay varies from the original set. The Keeper and Creeper cards add extra curves and turns never seen before, as well as plenty of new rules and the introduction of Surprise cards, and fantastic art to boot. I don't find it particularly more or less challenging than the original, just different in a way that's worth the extra cash.

3868	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	The model looks absolutely stunning, but I must admit I am not exactly wowed by the game play. My biggest problem with this craft is how difficult it is to use offensively. By far the most effective means I have found is simply to use it as a battering ram, but because of the annoyingly low shields it cant keep that up for long. The other way is to use the jam action to stress enemy ships and then use the slicer tools to deal damage to stressed ships, but this is annoyingly complicated. Probably the best option for comparison is the imperial assault carrier, witch has a hard point and the nifty effect of actually being able to carry fighters. I suppose the trade off is it is considerably cheaper but if you equip the combat retrofit it cost the same as the imperial carrier. It looks really cool but for me its just been a glorified battering ram.
What I like about the game is the creative destruction.  Bananagrams is GREAT for helping kids understand "happy accidents."  I have a child who beats himself up over mistakes.  In this game, you have to take apart in order to build.

Maybe it's the competition of being able to answer as many right as possible, maybe it's fun for them to push the buttons, I don't know why and I don't care.  All I care about, is that they are having fun learning their math facts at breakfast!  By the way, don't believe the other reviews that say you can't see the answer when you push the buttons.

Having these charts at your fingertips saves a lot of time leafing through the various books for a quick ruling.  The four panel construction gives GM's room for both a notepad and their maps.  The heavy card stock covers means its very durable and suitable for frequent use.  If you're a GM for a Pathfinder game, and you don't have this screen, my suggestion is that it be the next item on your "To Purchase" list.  Highly recommended.
1315	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Inspired by Around the World in 80 Days, Ticket to Ride is a blast.  I was impressed with how involved yet laid back the gameplay is.  This is a quietly strategic game that will challenge you to make the right moves at the right time.  The concept is to travel to and from specific destinations, but the key is that no one is aware of where you are going or where you are starting from and the routes to each destination can vary depending on the cards you have in your hand.  You can select multiple routes, which allows you to travel to different destinations at the same time, and while you do get points (visible points) for each route to lay down, you get extra points tallied at the end of the game for each ticket you complete, and because you keep your tickets hidden from other players, no one is aware of how many you have completed and how many points each of your tickets is worth.  In other words, when we played this the other night I was in last place on the board and wound up winning by over 70 points because I had completed far more tickets than anyone else!  This was a blast.

The general premise is that you're a time traveler from an alternate timeline (not the history we know, but some alternate history) who has to return home.
The game components were nice although the very small size of some of the cards stood out immediately. They are still workable for adult hands though. Some of my train pieces were chipped slightly and appeared to have some grime on them, which was odd. Also the game board itself didn't like to lay completely flat on the table.

The game has a similar feel to Settlers, but isn't quite as cut-throat, so it's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other. I can see why this game has won so many awards. I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost. The only thing we didn't like was that all the cards are very small (about 2 1/2" tall) making it very hard to shuffle them).
I would suggest watching Rodney Smith's "Watch it Played" series on this game which he has on Youtube.com You can see it taken out of the box, set up and played and make a more accurate decision on whether to buy it, it helped me a lot!

It's easy enough for the kids, and introduces really important concepts like bluffing, deception and sabotage.  As a responsible adult, I really enjoy this game because its really easy to bluff and deceive kids.  Heh, they never see it coming.  "Hey, I thought you were going that way, but your card says a different route!"  Gets me every time.  Or, "Hey I needed that line!"  Yeah kid, I know you did, I know.

* Despite simple gameplay, the complexity of variations of rules, actions, and goals can bewilder players unfamiliar with the game (though repeated play will break them in quickly). Many of the cards have explanatory text that should be read to all players or else they will not follow what is going on, especially if unfamiliar with the game.

When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.

7820	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I know this is a "classic" but in this version my almost 5 year old son (and myself actually) have trouble following the track.  You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again.  The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously cannot follow the higher numbers.  So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way.  It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.

The real mystery is how you're supposed to play.  There are a dozen "time cards" and once you've turned them up, that's it - you're done.  If you've matched some cards already, fine, you know those aren't the ones that are hidden, but for the ones you haven't had a chance to see yet (because you - by pure chance - turned up time cards first), you're just guessing.  There's very little room for reasoning out an answer.

1. Draw two train cards per turn from either the set of five placed up for all players to see, or blind from the train card deck. (One card if one of the showing wild cards is chosen.)
This makes for some highly focused deck building strategies.  Now about deck building, this game absolutely shines when you construct your own deck.  It helps mitigate the luck factor.  Certain abilities will allow the runner to expose certain cards so they know what they're running against or if there's a trap on a remote server.  Or an operation will allow the corporation to dig through R&D to pick out just the right ice to protect them from what the runner has installed.  Like with any card game though, you will still have to deal with being lucky.  Getting that 1 card you need or having all of your agendas in your hand but no ice to protect them.

The very first thing one should note is the designer of this game: Reiner Knizia (Ph. D in Mathematics).  He has designed such terrific games as Lost Cities, Samurai, Tigris and Euphrates, and many more.  Every game he designed which I have played combine a wonderful mix of accessibility and long term strategy.  Much like Carcassonne, the strategy in these games is not quite obvious at first, but with time, one learns that there is much more to be learned while novices can still play an expert player and present a challenge.

NOTE 2:  The game doesn't get repetitive quickly, as there are many cards, and each of them has 3 choices of tasks -- so someone could discard a card without anyone in the room ever hearing what 2/3 of the tasks are.

I grinning guy looking forward to time with a metal-clad winking female shaped robot?  Except the forced interaction previously described, its even more solitaire-like than Puerto Rico.  At least there you can shaft people by claiming a boat or two and cause them to throw their goods in the drink or buy the building you know the other guy needs or sell the good to the trader they have so they cant.  Yes, thats how I play that game.  I like to think of it as defensive playing.  Yeah, thats it.  But no room for that in this game.  I guess my mom should really like it.

It can get a little loud when the older kids all bang on it at the same time, but used in moderation, it's great. The babies like to crawl all over it, drool on it, taste it, and everyone else pounds on it, and it still looks and sounds great. Minor wear and tear on the drum face from so much use and from being dragged in and out of my trunk over and over, but nothing too bad. It's low to the ground, so all of the kids can easily get to it and it's actually a great height for the babies to pull up on and stand. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a drum with a nice, full sound that kids can play. Would probably also work great for adults, I've just never tried that!

This school bus is very light and can be knocked over and moved around but that is all part of the fun as my daughter even likes to move it around while she is inside of it. The best part is that it folds up easily in seconds to be put away and unfolds in seconds for play time.

It was immediately recognizable for what it was from the picture on the box *before* I knew anything else about the expansion and, as I said, was a primary reason for my buying Call of the Wild.

I'm not sure she completely understands the concept of analogies, but somehow managed to get most of the answers right.  That made the 10-year old want to join in.  As a mom, I love anything that makes them want to learn on their own - even if the motivation is jealousy.
It's quick and easy to set up and the rules are not complicated.
7829	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I really like Chutes and Ladders for its educational value. It teaches children how to count to 100 and how to take turns. The pictures on the board also show the difference between cause and effect (ie: you break a dish you have to sweep it up). It is also no so very long although if you get caught up in some parts of the board it can drag on a bit. Still a very fun gave to play. Simple, no reading required.

4797	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place, problem is it doesn't stay. its such a tight fit, one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out. With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity; net-net, not a good teaching tool. Its also much smaller than I thought it would be.  We returned it.

When my family gets together Quiddler comes out of the box.  We don't have anyone younger than 23 at this point.  I am not sure this game would be fun to play across generations when younger people were involved.  The gaps in vocabulary may be to wide.  But we have a good time when we play.  Our vocabularies are all equally small!  (Except Mom's; she always wins.)

To give you an idea of the challenge to get started, its literally two large decks of cards and some tokens in the box which could have been made much smaller but for the enormous instruction manual!

1905	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We're now on our second elf in four years and the newest model (2014) is made differently than the 2009 or 2010 model we had before.  Why would we need a second elf when we only have one kid you ask?  Well, because the clothing these little elves (demons) wear is not prone to burning off when placed next to a light bulb.  Yes, not a good idea for the elf to hide within a ceiling light fixture because it is a tricky place to find him...when forgetful parents later turn the light on to mop the floor.  The next time our elf moved to a new location in our house, he had a hole in his pants.  So, don't permit these elves to hide near incandescent light bulbs.

Also I never felt like my character was too good or too weak.  I was a brawler and my opponent was a range hero.  I never felt like I couldn't close the gap, yet at the same time I did notice that there were clear times that I would have to think about how to approach it based off of their movement.  It took about 7 turns for me to actually consider how my opponent was going to move and counter me.  There was a point where I was beating my opponent 20-10, but they quickly turned it around and the game ended with me winning 4-0.  From what I heard from other reviews and players the game is very balanced as long as you stick to the rules and time structure.

This drum is the perfect size.  It's large but he can easily carry it around (and does).  The mallets are soft rubber and despite his enthusiastic drumming, the sound is mellow, low, and not obtrusive.  It's much more pleasant to the ear.  The drum is excellent quality and holds up well in a classroom-type environment, so I expect this will last a long time.

Because of their mistake I am now stuck with an incomplete Vocaloid set! Besides from that the box was in terrible condition when I received it and some of the Vocaloid characters are terribly painted to where it looks like they are faded such as Luka's hair which is more of a lavender than a bright pink and Miko's hair was blonde instead of brown. Horrible customer service and horrible item; I will never buy from this company ever again and I recommend everyone to do the same.
Intrigue:
6015	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a great solid game for ADULTS!  So many are too easy and you lose interest very quickly.  That is not the case here.  At first , the rules almost seem overly complicated.  But, after you read them and then actually play it becomes fairly easy to negotiate or thug your way through the game.  Whether you are a fan of the show are a board game fan - this game has many twists and turns and I don't see it getting boring anytime soon.  It even has an added more complex way to play to change it up a bit, just in case you might consider getting bored.  You can play this with 3 or 4 players or 3 or 4 teams depending on your flexibility.  You can mix and change it up a bit as you go to your liking.  But, overall the game involves 6 rounds and has 6 stages within the rounds.  At the end of the 6 rounds, the player or team with the most money wins the game.  This is a game that involves negotiating, bluffing, back stabbing & a bit of strategy to come out ahead.  This is just like the TV show really!

My son is two and he loves to color. The idea that not only could both of my kids color the same page (and multiple times) was perfect because they wouldn't have to fight over pictures.

If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.

The gameplay is deep, but the concept is simple. One player is the corporation, the other is the hacker. The job of the corporation is to introduce and complete various corporate agendas. The job of the runner is to hack in and "steal" these agendas. Each side has tools to make their job easier. The corporation can use various cards like a firewall to protect their servers, and the runner has programs and hardware designed to break through them. The game goes so much deeper than I can describe here. Suffice it to say that this is a very rich game, with many layers of strategy and tactical decision making that will bring hours of enjoyment even when you aren't playing.

One thing to watch out for, in my opinion, is that the original USA edition is initially fun but that fun can turn to frustration once you realize the easiest way to win is to just build the long northern routes. That problem is corrected with the 1910 Expansion by providing new route tickets, a new way to score bonus points, and two variants: Big Cities and USA Mega-Game -- the Mega-Game uses everything in the expansion set and is my favorite way to play Ticket To Ride: USA). However, I still prefer the maps and additional challenges (like building ferries and tunnels) that are provided by the Europe and Marklin editions.

6610	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game works great with kids, although I'll admit I've had plenty of fun playing with my own age group. It's all luck with the only strategy coming from which piece you want to move. But I've still had plenty of fun, although it can get frustrating not being able to roll a 6 (which you can try and fix with house rules). My suggestion is to make sure you have all the pieces kept in a plastic bag because they are very easy to lose, especially if kids are playing. I haven't had any trouble with the bubble (excuse the pun), and it works just fine. You always have the option of using a different die, but the best part of the game is popping that bubble! The best feeling is when you get sweet revenge by bumping back a player to start. I would get the game it's heaps of fun!

The hero cards (8 included in the base game, and 8 more available in the Hero Booster Pack #1) in the game are printed on good card stock and each of the cards has really nice artwork.  Each hero card is double sided (one side is a Novice side and the other side is the Master side) and abilities change when flipped over.  I am disappointed that they didn't take the opportunity to provide the hero slightly differently on the Master side as each side has the same artwork of the hero.  They could have changed to pose of the hero, or add armor, or something.  The game also includes 4 reference cards to help remind players what each face of the die do and what treasure tokens can be obtained with their special purpose.

6081	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Playing board games has been my hobby for about 40 years.  I began playing them when I discovered the bookcase games in the late 1960s.  The intricate strategy games have always interested me, which is why this one intrigued me.  It's a well designed game that will appeal to just about anyone.  The fact that they offer beginner and advanced rules will provide a rich playing experience for all levels of gamers.  In the basic game, you shift gears to roll dice that allow for higher numbers and more spaces moved on each turn.  Players have to slow down to allow for stopping a certain number of times in turns.  Not slowing down enough will cause damage to your engine and damage points are taken away, so there is a small element of strategy even in the beginner's game - not enough to make it difficult, but enough so that it's not just roll and move.  In the advanced game, the rules allow for a lot more strategy.  You have to account for tire and engine wear, weather conditions, and much more.  It's a great strategy game for those who love that sort of experience.  I played a lot of Strat-o-matic Baseball and Civilization, so I know what an intricate and rich strategy experience is like, and this game has it in spades.  The artwork and components are really impressive and there are a ton of tracks that can be purchased, so the re-playability is endless.  Leagues can also be made for true racing fans.  This game is a re-release of another version called Formula De.  It had a ton of tracks made for it and they all work with this version, so this opens a world of opportunities.  This is a true classic!
Overall, this is a great game!  I recommend it to people who enjoy fun board games that require good strategies.

That being said, at this price point this is really a great crawler. I emailed the vendor and added 4 wheel steering (ridiculously easy and dirt cheap). This was bought to basically drag dog toys around to wear my wife's Pekingese out indoors. It's been used for quite a bit more than that and has performed very well. I only had one small issue the set screws holding the front and rear hubs onto the axles worked loose. Luckily we found the one that fell out and I removed all 4 and applied some Loctite and tightened. That will never happy again.

First, the Commander. Despite his authoritative name, he never really gets to feel like he's in charge. This feels like a missed opportunity somewhat. The Commander is responsible for dispatching interceptors (fighter craft) to attack UFOs over the map. He controls a few of XCOM's perks, and most importantly controls the budget. Near the beginning of every timed round, he is told how many credits XCOM has available and is responsible for pulling them out. This is the only time the app clearly needs to give just a few more seconds to the player. I kept my credit pool stacked neatly in stacks of 5 (it comes with 29... don't go crazy trying to find your missing one), and I still nearly ran out of time when it told me I had 13 credits in the budget. The Commander can also dip into XCOM's limited cash reserves, and has a special "asset" card given by what continent XCOM HQ is placed in, a location which is assigned by the application. Every unit the team places on the board, whether Soldier, Scientist, Satellite, or Interceptor, costs XCOM 1 credit. Ostensibly, the players communicate with the Commander about how much they really need from the budget. Go over budget, and you accelerate your march to losing the game. Ultimately, though, the Commander has no real say over how many units other people place on the board. He can tell the Chief Scientist that we can only afford two scientists this round, be completely ignored, and have the game lost. Teamwork is important, but it feels like "Commander" should mean something.

Later in the day, they played for another hour by themselves.

One highlight of the answer boards that come with the family editions of both games is that the reverse sides feature meeples, and since they're designed to be used with dry erase markers, kids will have great fun decorating and customizing these meeples!

1351	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This game is ok for what it is. It is a simple game where you try and get multiple cards of the same color, to match up with the corresponding colors on the routes on the map. You score points for going from one city to another, scoring more for larger routes. You draw "destination cards" that have 2 cities on them, and if you connect them you score bonus points. The game consists of players making their own routes longer, or blocking other players. Not very much to it, and it is really annoying when 5 turns go by and you never get the cards you need. There is a decent amount of strategy in this game, but it is nowhere near as fun as Power Grid, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico, or 7 Wonders. I have tried to enjoy this game, because the hype must come from somewhere, but to no avail. If you want to begin getting into fun board games that are not too difficult, but better than monopoly or sorry that you grew up with, I would recommend 7 Wonders or Carcassonne.
This particular version of Magnetic Poetry makes a great little "thinking of you" gift for someone who needs some cheering up, some encouragement, some soul-hugging comfort. Using this kit with the kit that comes with the stand allows for more expression, creativity, and interaction.

The journal would be something that they could hold and work with in such situations.

The price on Amazon was very reasonable; even better than the crafts stores with their discount coupon.
All in all, I think it was a cool experiment. Kind of expensive, so it was a special treat. I don't think it was anything we did that made them "special" since in the 2- 2.5 weeks it took from arrival to butterflies, we were out of the house for more then half that time. The other times, it was on a dresser drawer away from the kids.  She likes to look at them Occassionally, and I would hold her up to see them, but she wasn't that interested as it was just a chrysalis for the most part, but when they emerged to become butterflies, she was super excited and got to watch so that in itself was worth it.
My only complaint is the packaging and expansion packs.  The packaging is cute, but hinders the rapid setup and play in my opinion.  Storing components and retrieving components is awkward.  The theme of reaching into a treasure chest is excellent.  Perhaps if they used a tray to store the other components.  I would rather have seen a regular box used for storage.  The chest is just awkward.

5338	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My six-year-old daughter and I have played this game a few times since receiving it.  It is **Fun **Challenging **A great way to spend time together **Easier yet more challenging than Scrabble!  As a Scrabble lover, I understand that it can be frustrating for younger cutie pies to keep up without getting frustrated (with Scrabble).  This game has a similar premise: creating a grid by building or adding onto rows - in this game: of color or shape.  Starting a new row or finding a way finish an existing row of shapes or color ("Qwirkle!") really makes you use your thinker BUT it's very fun so the mental challenge is greatly rewarded with lots of smiles and high-fives :)  We have yet to use the scoring system...  We just like the challenge of tile arranging!
89	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is much harder than it looks especially when you have to make the legs and trim the face. To make a good Pom Pom puppy you need an old movie an awesome mama and last allot of coffee. I made a Pomeranian and it was so cute (I did this with my mom and we were watching singing in the rain with a good conversation topic) the next one looked like a mess ( I did this one by myself ) so if you like a good challenge than this is for you but if you switch from making bracelets too writing reviews ( like me ) than you just might need more help than you think. You can make up to 2-4 . You have to use thick yarn thin won't work ( it comes with 4 things of yarn ) . So if you can handle hours of trimming and cutting than get your scissors out, if you have to have a partner than pull 2 pairs out just remember it's hard work and it's so long.

We also have a couple of world atlases, so we use those if we need to see details, but for quickly answering the children's "where is _________?" questions this globe has been great.

Whether you are a hard core board-gamer looking for strategy and competition or looking for a easy game to play with your anyone from your kids to seniors, this game is for you.  It is simple enough to explain in less than 5 minutes but compelling enough to keep you coming back for more again and again.  As a side note I would highly recommend that you buy the 1910 expansion with it since it provides 36 additional destination cards and reprints the originals to a more manageable size.  Hop on the train of Ticket to Ride and you won't be disappointed!



8297	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Very good game at a very good price.
Overall, the fourth edition is great. The whole idea of Fate counters in my opinion is awesome.  For example, now any character can have an extra die roll in battle, similar to the Warrior's awesome ability.  Slight difference, tho, as the second roll MUST be used with fate, whereas the Warrior can choose between the two.

What I really like:
No matter which version you pick, if you know how to play one, the others are easy to pick up, and the rules of all editions are fast and easy to learn in about 5 minutes.

Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.

We play it anytime that we aren't interested in or can't agree on television. (You'll actually be able to downgrade your cable connection, just because "Quiddler" is more fun, relaxing, and entertaining.)  A good raucous game of "Quiddler" is pretty quiet. You'll be too busy checking spellings in your dictionary, switching cards around to stimulate new words into your brain, be anticipating the next possible letter that you might draw, making decisions, and plotting your strategy.  But best of all, this is a game that a person of 12, 30, 50, 80, 90, or a 100 years old can all play together.  Everybody can win.  Everybody has fun.  And everybody will have more energy when it is over than when they started.  You might want to maintain your health, so that you can be your best at "Quiddler". It will show in your score. One Tip, the game changes in speed and enjoyment according to the number of players that you have.

This game of Scene It plays pretty much like any other game of Scene It.  You roll, you move, you answer a question on the DVD or cards and if you get it right, you move again.  Unfortunately, the first roller had moved three quarters of the way around the board before getting a question wrong.  And that was only because that person lost an "all play" which is really the only way to end a turn in this new game.  They also added a new DVD category called "my puzzle" which allows you to use the DVD remote to pick an answer.  These are also too easy.

We have enjoyed playing it and are now looking at the expansions to change it up a little.  Watching the online video from the maker of the game (Fantasy Flight Games) on their site before playing for the first time was a huge help as the game is pretty complex the first time you play.  But once you have run through the game once or twice, you have it down and its a lot of fun.

My only complaint is that some of the rules that are left out will have to be "re-learned", but that's not really a big deal. The point is to try to get people involved in the game with as little hassle as possible and it does a good job of that.

It just brings the game to a whole new level with strategy and memory. I'm pretty addicted to it myself! Could use it at an grown-up party with chips or money thrown in the pot when you lose a hand, just for a twist on the normal euchre or poker party.

8790	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Little ones love this car.  My three-year-old companion and I were at her playgroup.  There were two of these little cars among the toys, and we played with one.  I would pull her to the top of the small incline and let the car go.  She drove it and actually did try to avoid hitting other kids.  Soon a young boy joined us, and they were racing down the incline -- at which time I did not have to ferry the car up in order that she could go down.  They played together until they drew too much attention from other children who then wanted to race the cars too.  There is very little that is more delightful than hearing a child's laughter;  the play yard was filled with giggles.  (5 stars for enjoyment and education.)
these awesome blocks
But there was a bit of bad too.  First of all the game is long and my first play was made even longer (approaching 5 hours!) by players asking too many questions and taking too much time to take a handful of actions (especially one player in particular).  It's funny because I don't balk at spending 5+ hours playing video games and RPGs but I've figured out that's because I'm constantly doing something.  That's 5+ hours of pretty constant activity.  In this game I timed it and there were instances where I alone was waiting 30 minutes just for my next action which took a couple of seconds.  30 minutes of doing nothing is brutal and when it happens every round it wears on you.

This mat is made of a rubbery bottom with a glued piece of fabric with a starfield pattern, the star wars logo on a corner. Think of it as a thinner gigantic mousepad.  Being 36"x36" it is not very portable, unless you want to spend more money on a poster tube. I have use it for about one month and a half, about 10 games and so far it holds fine. My earliest concerns were that the fabric would unglue with time, specially in the corners, as it would be expected of a mousepad with time. So far this has not happened. It has affected my gaming experience positively. I usually took a lot of time to set the play area in the right dimensions and even used a felt cloth as mat sometimes but it would move a lot. This stays in place, so it makes the game easier, reduces the time to setup and is tournament regulation so it helps when running scenarios. It also looks cool to play on it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is committed to this game or even to Armada. It works for both games.

Regroup Phase: Here the adventurer retires to the tavern. They collect experience points equal to the level they achieved on the Level Die. If the adventurer was brave enough and somehow made it all the way to Level 10 on this delve, they must retire and collect 10 experience points. The adventurer can keep seeking glory by going deeper into the Dungeon if they have not achieved Level 10 yet. Remember if the adventurer cannot defeat all the Monster Die, they must flee the Dungeon and no experience points are gained.

Turns basically consist of choosing a plot (from a deck of 7) that determines gold for resources, turn order, and hand size for the turn; next, drawing cards, then purchasing characters, locations, and attachments; and finally, attacking the opponent in three ways: military. intrigue, and power - each with unique benefits. Who ever scores 15 power first wins. If playing with 3 to 6 players, titles from the series are also included, such as Hand of the King, that also mix things up a bit.

With each turn, gangs must attempt to control a range of sites by assigning gang members and resources to claiming, defending and fighting for money, contraband and guns. However, other players can challenge the right for territory, which will lead to conflict! Negotiate, threaten and ally with rival gangs when it serves your needs, but be wary of the inevitable knife in the back. This game is about making and breaking alliances, and only the gang with the most money at the end of six rounds wins.

Unlike Risk and Monopoly, though, it doesn't take a week to play -- more like an hour.

2526	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Based on the name "Tile Lock Scrabble" I thought the tiles would actually lock in place, perhaps lightly snap on to the board, but these tiles don't lock on at all.  Instead there are little raised dots on the corners of each square on the board.  Each tile has indentations molded into the corners.  You place a tile on the board and it rests between the dots.  The deluxe edition scrabble board has bezels between the squares that serve pretty much the same purpose as the dots do on this one (but it's twice as much as this one.)  The instructions say that the tiles will stay in place even if the board is tilted, which is absolutely true, but they will not stay in place if the board is bumped or jostled even a little.  The slightest bump and the tiles dance right off their squares.
In theory, the game would teach a toddler to wait his/her turn, how to match colors to move along the path, and then the important life lesson about winning/losing and still having fun.

What I'm trying to say is that I enjoy the IDEA of Fluxx a little better than I enjoy the actual game.  It's chaotic, and difficult to keep track of what's going on at any given time.  I understand that's supposed to be part of the appeal of the game, but unless everyone has played the game before, you end up having to teach the game to a new person every single game, which ends up slowing everyone down and sapping a lot of the fun.

Monty Python Fluxx and Zombie Fluxx--which to choose? A tough call. Zombie Fluxx's gameplay makes it more possible for someone to win in a wild combination of moves that requires a lot of forethought--or just plain dumb luck. Monty Python Fluxx's gameplay is more straightforward. In that, it may actually be the more mental game. Shrewd gameplay rewards players more often than in Zombie Fluxx. Still, the even better question may be, Why not buy both and shuffle the decks together? Indeed, what could be better than going after the Killer Rabbit with a chainsaw? Or dispatching a quartet of zombies with Excalibur? Talk about making tasty brains hurt!

Also during the Monster Phase, you can activate your hero's ability or ultimate ability, you can use treasure tokens, or you may use any Scrolls that you have.  Scrolls allow you to re-roll any of the dice (party and dungeon).  Once all the monsters are removed from play, the player can then continue on to the Loot Phase where players can open chests or quaff potions.  It is always optional to open chests or quaff potions.  While players may not always want to open chests or quaff potions, each one of these rolled means one less monster (or possible dragon).  If you choose to open a chest using your dice, then you can gain a treasure token at random (these can be really useful!).  If you quaff a potion (even your scrolls can do this), then you can bring a party die back from the "graveyard" (the place where your used party dice end up) and you get to choose what face you want to use.

The bottom line: Eminent Domain is certainly indebted to its respected ancestors, such as Dominion, Race for the Galaxy, and Glory to Rome, and unmistakably bears their influence in its design, in terms of the deck-building and role-selection mechanics, and also the space theme that it shares with Race for the Galaxy. But this blend of mechanics and influences does result in a product that is quite different from anything we've seen before, and allows it to stand on its own despite being constructed on a foundation that is largely derivative. If you enjoy these other titles, there's a very good chance you'll love the card-play and dynamics of Eminent Domain enough for it to earn a place in your collection on the basis of its own merits. - EndersGame @ BGG
3797	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	The learning curve for this one may turn some people off but the payoff is a very deep, well thought out experience. While the theme with a lot of games feels a bit "thrown in," it permeates this one and you really start believing you're in this futuristic world of hacker vs. corporation. You're probably going to keep the rulebook nearby for your first bunch of games, and thank goodness for being able to search cards/rules online quickly during a match, but it always feels fun and the more you get used to gameplay the more fun it becomes. While there's obviously some luck involved because it is a card game, your decisions are what will get you those tasty Agenda cards and ultimately victory. It's surprising how many actions you can perform on a turn, and while it feels like very few actions are ever wasted, it never feels so tense that it stops being anything short of a great time. I've never played an asymmetric card game or had an experience like this and I absolutely love it. I look forward to many more games and exploring some of the expansions.

The other reviews are true, it's like dominoes and scrabble, but I thought it was a lot like the card game Set as well. It's got that same "everything has to match or everything has to be different" element to it that makes it more challenging. And since it's turn based, there's still that competitive element of hoping that your opponent doesn't see/take the opening that you see and plan on using. Really fun game, and yet really simple design. I like that the little squares are not super cheapie, so the game should last a long time.

I typically recommend playing once as each side in a sitting.  There are also a few tweaks which can be used to make the game easier or more challenging including a variant game.  You can leave your discards facing up in a row so the opponent can see which cards you no longer have, or you can discard face down relying on their memory.  Same goes for characters defeated in battle, you can leave them exposed or turn them upside down.

The frustrating part came when we tried following the directions to put it back together. We still haven't been able to get the hips to stay together. The sticky organs are fun, except when you are trying to put them back in order. Their stickiness becomes a con. After the excitement of operating the first time, we've only used it one more time because it's too hard to reassemble it!  Also, I think the hips are defective. The "pro" of this toy is the book and information for the body parts as the child operates.


4815	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Despite the age recommendation that this is for an 8yo, we bought it for my 5yo daughter because she loves her "bones book" and is pretty good about repeating back the right words for bones and organs.  Plus the "squishy" nature of the organs makes her laugh.  The pieces are a little flimsy though, and some of the bones don't snap back into the plastic "body shell" like they should, and they fall out.  Overall it's a good learning tool and she loves it.

917	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	So glad I bought this game! have to say that Ticket to Ride has become an ultimate favorite for us. As far as I am concerned, even when I lose it's a blast! It's so much fun plotting to get your stations connected, and those of you who are particularly cut-throat can look for ways to cut off your opponents from getting the most direct route to connect theirs. For me, this is one of the best board games ever. There's no just tossing dice and moving a little piece around a board, and it can move quickly, so you have to be always thinking ahead to how you can best make your connections. Totally recommended for friends and families!
8823	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a perfect activity/toy/skill for a little one

The board fits right in the box, about 12 inches square, so there is no need to fold and unfold the board.

The tiles can be used over and over in different combinations without seeming familiar.  There are a good variety of generic tiles that will not make a person think "Oh, I've seen that rock formation in the last encounter."  However, there are also some unique tiles that give players a sense of importance when they see it.  With the right settings and plot, you could run an entire campaign with just this kit.  It should be noted, however, that this works great in conjunction with the other Master Sets (I personally use the dungeon set as well) to expand your settings.

You will end up having a ton of little figurines (sadly not painted the way some other games have them, but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense!), a bajillion little tokens, and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook, along with a really good collection of scenarios to play (a lot of 'em!).

I hate to tell you what to do but
The biggest criticism I have for this game (and really any game with this feature) is that once you are killed there's nothing left for you to do but watch the game finish out.  It's not as bad in Wiz-War because the games are reasonably short, even with 4 players, but I still think it's a crappy mechanic.

Honestly, I think it's more fun if you have 3-5 players because there's more potential for your planned routes to be disrupted. When you play a computer, it's not really out to get you, I don't think... people, however, are often out to get you.

6903	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	We got this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas & although she is admittedly smart, the game doesn't seem as much of a challenge for her.  The same holds true for any adult player.  It hasn't taken more than six lines to solve any given puzzle.  However, my 7 year old loves it and is a bit more challenged, but will probably conquer the strategy pretty soon.  Still, a classic game with classic, good family fun.  I would buy it again and it was more appropriately priced at $[...].  The only drawback we've seen is that the colors of the pegs were kind of "off", as in not classic colors and they don't all fit in their storage area so they fall out when trying to store away.

It is definitely noteworthy that ALL of the miniatures included in this pack are completely NEW, not re-releases from the old D&D 3.5-era miniatures booster packs.  The previous Dungeon Command faction packs (Cormyr, Lolth, Goblins and Undead) all featured old miniatures, although many of those creatures have new color schemes.  To some tabletop RPG enthusiasts, the miniatures alone will be well worth buying this pack.  They are EXTREMELY well designed models with VERY nice paint.

  The game can be as simple as you want - deal 10 cards, have someone bid for trumps (there are four colors in the Rook deck - each hand someone makes one color "trumps" meaning that cards from this color can catch any other color)... and then simply playing cards as they fall (like in Euchre). However, most serious Rook players enjoy the complexities that are learned throughout the years. What to play and when - how to guess what cards others players have - counting trumps and off-suits ...and so on. If you have never played this all may sound foreign, but you will catch on quickly.

To give you a small introduction to Red November - You have two problems: 1) you are a gnome & 2) you are on a gnomish submarine. (And we all know gnomes aren't submarine specialists) Over the course of the game you and your friends will be frantically running around your little submarine pumping out flooded rooms, disarming nuclear bombs, putting out fires (and possibly getting drunk in the process - because alcohol makes a gnome brave), etc. - just to watch as additional rooms burst into flames, fill with water, have the engine break down, or be attacked by a kraken.

The bottom line: Qwirkle is an abstract Scrabble-like game with colours and shapes that has all the essential elements - great components, quick play time, ease of learning, and just the right blend of luck and strategy - to make it the perfect choice as a gateway game or family-friendly favorite with instant appeal for people of all ages. - EndersGame @ BGG

His great-granddad said, "Wesley, you've just learned an important fact about trains--you never have enough track!"  So I thought why not add track now?  Brio track from 34 years ago still works with today's track.  When Wesley received the new track for an Easter present, he clutched it excitedly and said, "Thank you! Thank you!

Ill keep this short and sweetout of all of the games in my household, this one is the game most requested.  The kids really enjoy coming up with silly answers, especially when it comes time to point out my opinion in various situations.  Every answer I received on my turn revolved around Star Trek in some wayperhaps they are trying to tell me something?  We even brought this game out during a family & friend get-together, where most of them are not gamers by any sense of the definition.  Rather than score points, we just passed around the trivia deck and answered questions in humorous and inappropriate waysthis was, of course, after we sent the kids upstairs.  Pictures were drawn and secrets were revealed, though it was all in good fun.

We laughed so hard that we could barely draw new cards.  Several parts of our submarine caught on fire, we dealt with a few floods, and one of our players became a drunken, staggering gnome as we desperately tried to find him a cup of coffee as an antidote.  Some people might be offended at the fact that the gnomes drink beer, but it isn't really the focus of the game. The gnomes have 4 hit-points (lives/health points) and each beer they drink takes 1 away from their points.  If he has a beer, drinking it gives the gnome an advantage to repair certain "problems" that arise throughout the game.  Besides, it made the storyline very funny.

She is what some would call a "reluctant gamer" whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to.  She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck.

The game itself is pretty straight forward. Each player takes a number of tiles (somewhere between 16-20 tiles each), and then the game starts. You must take your tiles and start forming words in a crossword puzzle style. After someone has used all of their tiles, they yell "Banana" and everyone grabs an extra tile to work into their crossword puzzle. The game continues until all tiles have been taken, and the first to finish then is the winner.
The board game has many cards, tokens, figures and tiles.  So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands like

This Tile Lock version is the first time I've played it and if anything, it makes me want to give the basic version a shot. The board is tiny, the locking feature doesn't work, and maybe it's just me but there doesn't seem to be enough letter blocks if you want to play with more than one other person.

The concept is great, the execution is not perfect.  It can be hard to put pieces in, as the "locks" are at the corners.

On the street course, each player is given a character with their own stats,  a special ability, and a single-use (per lap) turbo. Special areas of the map can help or hinder you, and the car models for this event are completely different. It's a lot of game in one box.

Fluxx - Cthulhu Edition plays like normal flux except that it involves the mystery, horror, and doom of H.P Lovecraft's monsters, characters, and items. This edition has an added type of Goal called the UnGoal - where if its conditions are met, then Doom (the monsters) Win and everyone loses (unless you play with the added Meta Rule ~ which allows whoever is holding the Cultist or Secret Cultist card to win) ~ Which I think is a great addition/change from normal Fluxx as it adds an aspect of not only trying to work against each other but with each other at the same time (unless you're the cultist of course).

It's a nice way to spend some family time together while helping my daughter with counting skills and taking turns.  Yeah she gets mad if she gets sent home and has to start over, but being able to lose is also another skill she needs to learn.  I don't let my kids play with this game without parental supervison. The pieces are small and could be easily lost.  And also the quality of this game is not like I remember it being when I was a kid.  If it's played with roughly it will probably break.

8745	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This toy was purchased by me for my work as a child and family therapist. In teaching relaxation to children this toy allows me to illustrate deep breathing with a fun visual aid that will keep the kids paying attention and allow them to place their hands on something at the same time. This is often important when teaching children. They tend to be easily distracted and uninterested in learning some of the skills that are needed for their  treatment. This toy expands out and I use this to talk about breathing in deeply and filling your lungs up with air. When breathing out the ball can then be contracted and go back to normal size. The kiddos are fascinated with the colors and how big it can get and it provides some sensory feedback and "hands on" work that I find is so helpful when engaging children in skill building. Even if it wasn't used for this purpose its very amusing and fun to look at and play with for all ages.

He got a few other bigger toys, but this was easily his favorite. He loves it and I am impressed by how informative and realistic it actually is. Just beware that it's not easy to put all those body parts back together once it's dissected. It gives you an outline of how to do it, but I still tossed everything in a bag until next time.

It comes with an array of realistic cash and change, which is super fun. The money is just paper and plastic; I have a laminator so I just laminated the cash and it has a bit of an issue fitting in the drawers if  you are not careful to cut the laminator plastic along the edge. Still, it works and it should last a long time now. :)  It also comes with a cute little credit card, which if my previous register proved... will be quickly lost.

I mainly game with my wife so we are always looking for fun two-player games.  Being a huge fan of Star Wars, and after reading all the positive reviews of this game on here, I was excited to purchase this.

For us, the problem was trying to follow the written directions/rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun.  We wound up just playing by our own rules.  We enjoyed it mildly, but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble.

All in all, I would say this game is pretty well balanced and has lots of stuff going on without being to complicated.  There's little down time, and each round has different rules to keep it interesting.  And even though the theme of this game might be violent, it certainly isn't anything like Cards Against Humanity, which is intentionally offensive.  I've never watch the TV show, but I do like this game.

I ended up buying it from Barne's and Noble, because after ordering from Amazon backed seller and being told I'd receive it before Christmas, I received an email telling me I would get it until January 15th.

Compared to the first edition, the mechanics seem slightly simpler although this game is by no means easy to pick up. Even having played the first edition, it took us two "demo" games to really get in the groove. The instructions give a step-by-step demo game with decks to use for this (it's a 2 person duel, not a melee). This was helpful although the decks given are quite small and it's easy to run out of cards.

1083	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My wife and I absolutely love this game! It is very easy to learn and play, but there is an opportunity for deep strategy. The concept is simple: collect cards and build trains to connect destinations using those matching cards. You can choose to connect the destinations that will give you the most points, choose the routes that give you the most points, or try and block your opponent from reaching their destinations. This game can be learned in a matter of minutes and is very fun to play over and over again. The game board and parts are made of quality materials and I expect this game to last for a long time.
Let's take a look at the physicality of what you get for your fifty bones (yeah, it's pricey, but it's most definitely worth it). The box is that nice textured linen. Those always make me feel like the game is classier. I don't know if that really helps the box hold up over time, but it seems like it does. Opening it up, there's tons of thick, four color counters to punch and sort, tons of cards, both large (normal playing card) size and small (think original Ticket to Ride card) size to sort, and character and Great Old One cards. And the behemoth, six-panel board has a nice finish, too. The box has a molded plastic insert that will do fine in storing the myriad components once they are let loose from their cardboard forms, but there won't be a whole lot of room left to spare. I added a small velvet bag to use as a monster cup, and that was pushing it. The artwork is astounding and in very good keeping with the game's artistic gestalt. Fantasy Flight Games does this very, very well, for the most part, and Arkham Horror is no exception. In fact, I think they raised their own bar with this game in particular in reference to Artistic Direction, as everything they put out after this game seemed to me to be a notch higher than games they put out before. Kudos. Every piece of the art, from the box to the manual to the monster tokens to the iconography on the backs of the item cards are all part of a cohesive and consistent whole, which, given the sheer number of different items in this game, is a feat of no small merit. I believe this artistic gravity was achieved in part by re-appropriating the excellent art that was developed over previous years for use in the very good Call of Cthulhu card game. Some people don't like being "sold the same art twice", but it was a very good call by the folks at FFG. It keeps the prices down for us, creates that gestalt, brand gravity, and cohesion, and allows them to make the game maybe a little more profitable than if they had had to consign all new art. So, again, I tip my hat to the folks at FFG for making some excellent decisions regarding the look and feel of this game. It truly is a very well done whole, with every component visually reinforcing each other. Art-wise, every game should be so complete.

Cons = though you'll be able to use the dice and some of the tokens once the full game is released, the rest of the starter set will no longer be needed, the maps are not very useful given their small size (really served as a guide they could have easily put in the book rather than as a usable surface), it would have been nice if they included a bit more info so you could continue exploring the game until the main book comes out.

great gift for my little nephew to use.
There are the plastic miniatures: four new investigators and a fistful of new critters including the aforementioned Dunwich Horror and Dark Young of Shub Niggurath. These are unpainted as usual, but of singular quality of casting and very evocative conception.
The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate, but somewhere between 2-5 is probably best. If you stick to those numbers, a game will usually take around 15-30 minutes. (unlike the Zombies set, 2 player games are actually quite fun).
The non-stick coating is on the inside as well as the outside -- a nice touch. Both pans have handles, which are attached to the sides of the pans via rivets (they're not just spot-welded), which are *NOT* coated with the nonstick coating.  This means that some food can stick to these rivets on the inside of the pan.  It's a small inconvenience, though, when you consider the quality of these pans.

The springs are fun, but hard for little hands to remove or move. My son always asks for help with them. The propeller was the one great piece in this set except it was broken on arrival. Customer service was poor. They promised to find a replacement propeller but never never called back. Hubby fixed it with a fiberglass kit.

Since each of these additions are modular, you can use only the ones you like.  Even though I really only like 3 of the 5, Kingsburg is one of my favorite games, and if you enjoy it too, then I recommend you pick up "To Forge A Realm" as well.

We really love the fact that you can enjoy this game with the different variants. The solo variant is quite fun. I like to try different strategies or time myself while playing solo. You know basically get really good. So I can kick everyone elses butts. Thats what solo variants are for right?

While he is not building complex structures out of them, once we showed him how the gears work he has spent hours simple gear contraptions and is facsinated by the concept of gears.  With a little adult help, he can build pretty much anything.  I really like the idea that there isn't a "correct" structure that these are supposed to make.  My son also plays with lego for beginners but usually gets frustrated if his doesn't turn out exactly like the picture.  Gears are great building toys for encouraging creativity and teaching the concept of gears.

9438	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my 5 year old son and it has quickly become one of our favorite games to play. I agree with other reviewers who talk about the quality of the game itself. Our board is also warped (we've been able to bend it to flatten it some) and the pieces are simply cardboard. However the board is very appealing to look at and the game play is excellent. It is interesting and complex enough to keep adults and kids entertained. It seems to be the right amount of challenge for my son and he loves the idea of getting his friends and family safely through the storm and helping them run their errands. This game is actually one of the few games he's willing to sit through. I paid twelve dollars and just ordered another game by this company and I'm sure I'll order more in the future.

He was so excited when he opened it!  I read through the book (which I thought was pretty goofy, but if the kids like it, then who am I to judge?) and it at least explained the whole concept.  I know many people think that this elf idea is creepy, but I have seen so many who have had fun with it, too.

So, if you are at the end of your rope for game night with the kids, spend a few bucks and try this one.  It looks like it's going to have nine lives in my family.
Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from "analysis paralysis" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.

Then I learned about the free wonderful little adventures called "Beginner's Box Bash Demos" provided by Paizo.  Very good stuff, I must admit, yet they are just a bit more than a taste of how a (short) excellent level 1 adventures should be, and it wasn't anything like (length wise) the entire adventure provided by the box itself.

399	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	My grandsons have enjoyed this during their younger years. 3-4  Big pieces make it easy to play with for young hands.  Numbers are a an addl feature helping them learn the order up to twenty.
The copters are made from a mostly metal frame which give it some weight and a sturdy feel.  The weight is enough to make their motions predictable (but a little muted.  The frame also helps them survive sudden loss of power (which happens often when you are a beginner).  I like that the throttle is not spring-loaded to drop to 0 if you let go.  Earlier models had a controller that required you to hold the throttle at the desired position (maybe as a safety feature?).  This one has a smooth throttle that stays where you put it even if you take your thumb away.  Its easy to take off and hover...giving you a moment to get your bearings before flying it around the room.

In descent 1 your just roaming around... killing stuff mercilessly for about, say what?  6 - 10 hours if your a serious hero like me?  But all your friends are like, hey, I have a life and don't have time to kill stuff for that long and I want more real goals that aren't, say:  "Hey we need to kill some big monster."  Well...  If you want to have a better quest for everybody all around, and finish said quest in less than an hour and a half and are still a hero of descent 1, this little power-up is for you.

The rules of Quiddler are simple -- everyone's dealt three cards, then someone draws a card, then discards another.  The play continues around the table until someone is able to assemble all three cards in their hand into a word, then goes out.  Everyone else gets one more turn to draw and discard and try to make words from their hands, then points are tallied up (with any remaining cards resulting in deducted points).  The next round is the same but with four cards, then five, all the way up to ten.  High score wins!

Chess is a very classic game that I love... it is very classic. If Chess is the game of the early ages, Stratego is the game of the 20th century. If you are a professional Chess player you'd become a professional Stratego player as well.

7881	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	These are the only wooden block we could find in such a large size. I'm kind of disappointed in them. The paint is stamped on pretty messy, so on some the raised letter doesn't line up with the paint quite right. The paint easily chips off of the textured sides. Also, several of the blocks have huge cracks in the wood that go down an entire side of the block, nearly cutting it in half. This makes them hard to stack and also makes me worry about splintering in the future. I would not buy these again or recommend them.
So, I ordered this Charley Harper game for my little granddaughter.  She's a bit young to play memory, but not too young to enjoy pretty birds she can pick up and play with as tiny blocks. Three cheers for an old favorite given vibrant life!

I am not a fan of plastic toys and wanted to find magnetic letters that were more attractive than the cheap plastic ones I've seen everywhere. These were perfect. I ended up getting a set of uppercase and a set of lowercase. We've had them for over a year and they've stood up fine to my toddler's use.
The dividers for the pieces isn't as robust as the original and in fact mine came broken.  The color of the cards is slightly different on the back, not too different that they would be noticed from a distance.  The Lords for the expansion are very difficult to get the bonus points with.

It's like twister, only better and with the added bonus that they learn something.
Each time someone gets a turn they can move as far as they want (or are able to given the jammed hatch/flooded compartment/blazing inferno situation), then they take one of a limited set of actions, check for getting killed and do bookkeeping (which is where the events happen).

The rule book: It's a tome, for good reason. This game is a bit complex but it is worth it. The rule book had example scenarios but some of the images are either too small or low quality making it hard to read what's on the image. It's not a deal breaker but high res images would have been really nice.

Everyone then takes tiles from the bunch and puts them in front of them, face-down. The number of tiles you take depends on the number of people playing:

The book tells all about the elves and how important they are to Santa.  Your child's elf arrives on Thanksgiving and stays until Christmas Eve (when Santa arrives and the elf goes home with him).  Each night the elf flies back to Santa to report on your child's behavior ~ the good and the not so good ;)  By the time the children awake the next morning the elf has returned!  They will have a blast finding their elf in a new location each morning.

2726	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This stuffed tractor is great for Otis fans. It is well made and adorable. My two-year-old son, who loves all the Otis books right now, received this stuffed Otis for Christmas, and he loves it. He often asks to hold Otis during reading time or sleep with Otis at night. It is perfectly sized for a two-year-old child; my son can comfortably carry it around in one arm. However, prospective buyers should note that this Otis is all soft. That's great if your child wants to sleep with it, but the wheels do not turn and it does not roll. When my son first got it, he wanted it to act as a normal toy tractor so he tried to push it across the floor a few times, and he was frustrated that it wouldn't "work." When we explained that it was for cuddling and story time, though, he caught on and now loves Otis as a "stuffed animal" rather than as a toy automobile.
Turns out I needn't have worried - both of my *very* picky cats took to Pet Promise immediately and ended up liking it so well that they stopped being very interested in their soft/wet food, which was a complete reversal of behavior for one of them - she had pretty much refused to eat her hard food and lived for her daily soft food feeding. The other cat, who has never really been interested by food now gets very upset when his bowl is empty - even if he's not eating at the moment, he just likes to know that there's Pet Promise in his bowl.
So if your looking for a great family game for game night then look no further..
If you want to get a feel for how it plays, I recommend the mobile App version of the game.  We purchased it shortly after the board game, and every member of the family loves it, and uses it to hone their game when on the go.  We took the board game to the grandparent's house last weekend, and we had 2 kids, 1 parent and 2 grandparents all playing together, with the kids showing the grandparents how to play.  Playing with 5 players added a new level of strategy to it for sure!

6318	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Meet Lulu is an adorable 3-in-1 product for kids with a cute array of characters that teach recycling habits. You get a physical coloring book that is made from 100% recycled material, a stylus crayon, and an app that coincides with the coloring book that you can use the stylus with. The set encourages creativity and helps develop those fine motor skills. The activity book and stylus crayon come together and you can download app for free.  The stylus looks like a real crayon and is great for little hands. It's a spongy material so it's not going to scratch up your devices. The only downside I've discovered is that it seems a little too large to be used on smart phones with the smaller screens. It's best used on tablets. The photos on the pages are large and fun to color. Each page has a QR code at the top that you can scan with your tablet or mobile device and your child can color that picture using their stylus as many times as they like. When they are done, they can share their masterpiece with family using the share button in the app. Your kids can also color in the book and use the app to scan their colored page. Once scanned, their artwork from the page is transfered to the app for them to finish coloring on the go! It's perfect for road trips or at the doctors office to keep them occupied.
the activity books in this series are better

The game system may have started life as a FATE-based one, but it morphed in the process into something that bears no resemblance I can see to the currently downloadable version of FATE.

First, the game does not require children know how to read.  They do not even need to know their numbers as they do in "Chutes and Ladders."  Movement is based on a child being able to recognize colors and symbols.  What could be easier than that?

Given that there are also ways to lose along the way (in fact, it is quite possible you'll never get to the end... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself), it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game. At best (if things went very well along the way), you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning. But, ultimately a dice roll will decide your fate.

5337	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Had a lot of fun playing with the kids and adults.  Easy to learn and moderately challenging for most levels.
While this game isn't difficult, it IS confusing and the rule book and accompanying videos don't do a hell of a lot to clear things up.  I bought this game last Saturday at noon.  I spent most of the day reading the rules and watching videos trying to figure out how the heck to play the game.  Once I felt I understood I decided to play with my wife.  Upon starting, I found simply trying to explain the attack phase/edge battle aspect really difficult to do without my wife's eyes glazing over.
Play moves along quite smoothly, with each player trying to build train lines that connect up specific city to city routes as designated by destination tickets.  Routes are claimed by collecting series of colour train car cards that allow the player to place their plastic train cars onto the board.  The only point that we found a bit confusing is that there are five colours of train cars - each player gets a colour, but there are also coloured routes that while they match player colours actually have nothing to do with these colours.  A bit confusing at first, but after a few rounds you quickly forget and it all makes sense.

The strategy also makes the game fun.  With every turn, Im looking over the board and trying to play to get the most points without setting up my opponents to get bigger points.  Since this is an individual game, it helps that you don't have to try to second guess what your teammate has.  You are only playing for yourself.
8785	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	So far I'm very pleased with this product. My 6 year old loves it and wants to play all the time--that alone is worth the money, regardless of the durability. And durability is why I give it 4 stars--I've read the reviews and am less than hopeful on its longetivity. However, when I first got it out of the box, I had the same problem as many reviewers--it came on but wouldn't work. When I opened the battery compartment I saw that the batteries were slightly buckled, I replaced them flat and voila, the MathShark worked. It seems like the battery compartment is just the tiniest bit too small for the batteries; if you're having a problem, try repositioning them. The screen is small and not that easy to read, but it doesn't seem to bother my child at all. It's basically like reading a calculator.

This familiar game sets up simply and teaches basic concepts of rules, turn taking, and paying attention.  The game plays out in perhaps 5 minutes and therefore is quicker and easier to play than 'Chutes and Ladders'.  Also, the child does not have to count as required in 'Chutes and Ladders'.  Both games are excellent, but start with 'Candy Land' if you have any doubt of the toddlers ability to count and stay attentive for perhaps 15 minutes as necessary for 'Chutes and Ladders'.

Although they are both reading, because they are young, the kids made up their own rules for playing.  That's fine, because later on they can play more "by the rules."  It works like Scrabble, but comes in a cute yellow "banana bag," and tho this may sound insignificant, the tiles "feel" good...as if they are made of a very sturdy and smooth plastic.  Provides for economical play, too, as the price was right! I would buy it again for other relatives.

We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name, we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for, the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children.
990	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	What a great board game! I got it for kids for Christmas and we all played it during Christmas brake. Lots of fun! Highly recommended.
While I often complain about chance and this game includes card, the fact that you don't have to take all the destination cards you draw mitigates it, and that there are several face up cards to choose from also helps.  Anyone can build anywhere beats the imbalance Power Grid shackles you with.  Tit for tat.  Anyway, for having cards, I have no complaints.
We use this faction as a stand-alone group or fight for and against both sides depending on our mood.
Given all the nice new things it adds to the Imperial side, I think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game.

Two of the children paid it no mind, but one of the boys, who loves to read and assemble all sorts of things, put it together in one afternoon while he was at his grandmother's house, and now he displays it in his room, alongside his other model kits.  I sent each smart lab with a few anatomy books for children, which included information on the heart, stomach, and ears.  The little studious guy enjoyed everything.  The other two children enjoy more physical activities, e.g. helping grandpa in the garden, so they weren't ready for this.

So my child took it "to play", and I never saw the elf until Easter. I asked where is the elf? My child answered : He is far away, you will not find him!

The coins, fate, craft, strength and life pieces make for nice assessories.  The character cards don't make much sense on the first time playing.  I mean how do you know if your going to like spells or what is physic combat and why would I want it.  After the first game (I suggest if at all possible playing with someone whose played before) you'll know what character abilities will do the most for you.

I don't have much experience with the original TIE bomber but the punisher is massive and really has some cool upgrades. Like the y-wing the punisher is rather slow and hard to maneuver but the trade off is some decent shielding and epic weapons. I have personally found that the bombs are a little hard to use but if you manage to chuck one in the right place it can be very devastating. The model is, as always very detailed and beautifully crafted to scale. I wouldnt build an army full of punishers but I think I will be able to manage some pretty good destruction with the one.

3216	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	After receiving this expansion for the wonderful Arkham Horror base game we decided to go all out and throw every expansion we has onto the playing field. With the maximum investigators so we could have people covering all points, we gave it a shot. Many a player were devoured, and many and old gods broke the seal and destroyed our world, but it was so much fun. The new Kingsport field was aimed at giving the players a bit more survivability, but the damage that could be done from a Rift opening was immense. Thoroughly enjoyable and well worth it. If you want your players to survive better, you can just include the playing field additions. Personally, we saw moving portals because of the Rifts opening, and it was a lot of fun having to deal with a portal opening, moving and then another one opening behind it. (Apparently some of the smaller expansion have moving portals as well and we're excited to combine these and attempt to survive.)
High learning curve- longer than Catan, maybe about Battlestar Galactica length.

308	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests, intrigue, and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords, the new game play is fun!
I also liked how they tried to vary the sorts of Lord cards in the game. The original mix was mostly an effort to create every single possible combination of Quest Types per Lord apart from the "builder" as she's called in gaming circles. This time one can get points for completing quests of a particular expansion or even get a smaller penalty from corruption tokens in your tavern. Of course how things play out is a completely different story especially with cards that even allow you to reveal your Lord card early in exchange for protection from future Intrigue effects.

Great idea and so fun for the while family. Even once the kids stop believing, I imagine it could still be so much fun. Best part of our holiday season for sure!!!
What I love is how customizable it is. Yes, you should follow the rules to a T, but you can also shuffle in pieces from other D&D board games like Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt. Doing so can create massive mazes of randomized monsters. If you're getting even more invested, create your own heroes and villains from scratch by rolling in Reaper or other mini figures. You also get a horde of miniature figurines that would otherwise cost $50 so the value is well worth it.

Cons: why is this thing so expensive? Same with Elf on the Shelf.
self-gratification vs 3 or months of "pleasing Santa" and lying about the past months.
The only two complaints are very small...  First is the "6" card.  It has a giant green cat balloon being lead by small rats.  It is indeed a "Rat" card and not a desirable "cat" card despite the cat being depicted as the focus.  Also the "4" is very slim and stylized and looks like a "1".  Have had confusion over a younger player and an elderly player believing they had a "1" when it was really a "4".  Do these little things ruin the game?  Absolutely not, but it is something you might want to point out to those new to the game.

When one player, after taking their turn, is down to two train cars or less, the final round begins. Starting with the player to their left, each player has one final turn, and then the game is over. The trains on the board are counted to make sure that the points were totaled correctly during the game, and then ticket cards are revealed. If players can trace a continuous path between the two cities on their card with their color train cars only, they receive the points, and move their tokens accordingly. Otherwise, they lose the points, and must move their token down the scoring track that many points. The player who has the longest continuous track also gets ten points. The player with the most points is the winner!

2815	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Like some of the other reviews, I was disappointed that only one button comes off the jacket. The premise of the book is about 4 buttons coming off.  My grand daughter likes to do the 'take away' or subtract the one button from the total buttons. We can do that with the book, but not with the puppet. On the plus side, she loves the size of this Pete - it fits her little hand and she can hold him up pretending to lose his buttons. I may try to devise a way for each button to come off.
it has two game modes, beginner and advanced. I would say the beginner mode is just fine fine for 80% - 90% of the people playing this game. the advanced mode is more for tournaments and really hardcore gamers.
This game is different every time we play it. We are constantly surprised at the great words we make. This game would appeal to card game lovers, word lovers, and strategy lovers. It would also be a good game for youngsters, as they can use their existing vocabulary (and maybe even win!), expand it, and manipulate it to its fullest.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Netrunner is the asymmetrical gameplay. This means both players use different rules and goals. While it may not sound like it, this actually leads to a more balanced gameplay than I would have thought. The games are full of aggression, tension, trickery, and surprises. Highly recommended for anyone who's a fan of competitive card games.

PRO TIP:
6718	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I had a blast playing this game with a four-year-old child.  It was great to teach her the rules and watch her count carefully as she moved her little pegs from space to space.  Granted this game is for 5 years old and up, we did have a great time.  I agree with the recommended age range, but if you are patient, many 4 year old children will enjoy this thoroughly.  The only thing I was questioning was the sturdiness of the popper.  We were sitting on the carpet playing the game.  That may have been the problem.  I would recommend placing the gameboard on a flat surface, such as a kitchen table or coffee table, to make it easier to pop the popper.  Between 5 to 8 years old is probably a good age range for this game.
230	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Great game, but very difficult to learn.  It took us two hours just to read through the manual, so like other reviews said, you have to be patient.  My son wanted this game, and he's 10.  I wasn't sure it would be good for him, but he's smart as a whip and helped the rest of the family figure it out!

3444	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	These bracelets are super fun to make and to wear!  I'm way older than their intended market (I'm 23), but I still love them, and they're easy enough to make and wear that I'm sure their target market (ages 8 and up) could make them without much trouble.  Even my 20-year-old sister had to admit that the novelty aspect of being able to make stretchy bracelets like these, and fastening the flat strips into bracelets simply by sticking the ends together and wearing them for a few minutes (they permanently fuse after about 15 minutes of being warmed by body heat) is cool, even though she wouldn't be caught dead in a home-made brightly colored shiny bracelet.  My only complaints are that it only comes with four of the plastic strips to put the gel on (I want to do more at once, without waiting for them to dry first, although it's probably just as well that I couldn't use up all the gel in one go), the plastic strips aren't long enough to make an ankle bracelet (at least for an adult), and so far the refill sets only come with the same four colors of gel (judging by other Klutz products though, if these do well enough they'll start selling more colors eventually).
Each of the four suits represents one novel: Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion. The lower cards each has a verse from the particular novel, while the face cards carry the image of a person (The King of Hearts is Fitzwilliam Darcy.)
I recommend this to families, couples and is ideal as a "pull out" game with a couple of friends!

Yet, it has great play ability. In this deck both sides of the cards are playable. This is my guess to why the game is called Flip City. :) During your building phase you can purchase buildings and/or upgrade them . Upgrading the buildings is as simple as spending the money and flipping the card. Yet, getting your strategy and knowing which cards you want to flip is harder that you would think.

With the chips played, the Judge reveals their answer & points are scored - the system is designed to reward players who guess correctly without creating chances for runaway victories... in fact, the entire game is designed for maximum party enjoyment rather than maximum gamerness. (Yes, I know "gamerness" is not a word - but most of you get what I'm talking about.)
Right out of the gate there's a few expansions (Calveras, Grim, Irish) that allow you to play with additional players, but they really don't give you too much beyond that.  You could probably invent your own just as easily.
Fairly simple rules. The strategy comes in balancing the different risks. Should I go ahead and claim the railroad I need now, or should I get the cards that I will need for the next section? If I place a railroad, will others guess where I am attempting to go and block me from proceeding? Should I attempt to get additional destination cards to increase my point total, or should I try to keep others from completing their destinations?
I sort of didn't want to spend around $10 for a dot to dot book though, no matter how cool it was.

The doll is just like the book and her mouth is wide and stomach deep enough to fit all the bean bags.  The mouth is the only opening so you'll have to remove the animals through there as well.  Although I wish the doll had a velcro opening in her belly to remove the animals.

If everyone showed chickens, they stay at the middle of the table and nothing happens.  If someone shows a fox or rat, that player steals all the chickens (if there are multiple foxes or rats, they take turns stealing.  Rat gets last pick if there's even 1 fox) and puts them in front of you as points for the end of the round.  However, if someone plays a fox/rat and you play a guard dog, you just saved all those chickens and put them in front of you as points.  What if you play a guard dog and no one played a fox/rat?  You didn't save any chickens, so nothing happens except you wasted your only dog card.

This card game, plays a bit like a board game. Initially you arrange the 32 time cards chronologically in four rows of eight with all the dates black and the card colors visible being purple and blue. The Purple cards are Linchpins and can be flipped by cards in the deck, and the Blue cards are Ripplepoints and flip when corresponding purple cards flip. For example, If you flipped 1865 from black text to red text, Lincoln Assassinated to Lincoln Wounded, that would trigger you to flip 1868 Johnson Impeached, because Johnson couldn't be impeached if Lincoln never died. Thus, a paradox is created. Before I get to paradoxes, let me tell you about cards you will draw during your gameplay.

2) Having a single die is also the right choice for complexity.  Kids get practice first in counting to 6, then in recognizing the numerical symbols of 1 to 6 on a standard die.  This links the abstract concept of a number like "five" to the real world example of a set of five spaces that they can move.  As adults, we don't realize there is a difference, but for a young child it is one of the first big abstract concepts he or she is asked to learn.
The game is not hard and is fast paced and you can adjust the playing time to fit your schedule.

I am a Speech-Language Pathologist and I am "known" for the great games I bring to my sessions.  I was disappointed long before I showed it to any of the kiddos I work for.  The game is cheaply made.  :(  Very poor quality!  The game board is warped.  The pieces don't all pop out and I'm guessing this is an issue because there is note that says not to force them but to have scissors to cut them with.  REALLY!  I often like the kids to help me learn a new game.  If I had done that with this one, they would have torn the pieces.  The board with all the pieces is very visually difficult.  I live on an island in remote Alaska and was so excited to get this game.  Running errands ahead of a storm or hoping the ploughs and sanders was out is something the kids could relate to.  I'm sorry very disappointed

5) Storage: The pathetic little lightweight plastic "balls" and maddeningly unstackable checkers cannot be sandwiched for storage inside of this two-sided tin (even though this is touted as a "feature" of the product) when/if kept in the nylon netted bags in which they come. We had to separate "balls" and checkers out into several ziploc baggies in order to spread them out in a "thin enough" layer to actually get the tin to stay sandwiched closed. So essentially, we had to repackage all the playing pieces immediately in order to simply get the tin to stay closed for storage in between play sessions.

It is also a great game for people to get into the board gaming hobby.
Everything about Bananagrams is Major FUN, the quality of the tiles, the portability and storability, the adaptability and flexibility. Because the game is so simple to explain, it is also simple to change - to adapt to different skill levels, different environments and time constraints.

I first bought Legend of Drizzt (easiest of the three) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp. Castle Ravenloft is brutal, a meatgrinder. WOA takes the middle ground, for the most part. There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time. If you are playing two-player or solo, this will wear you down. One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters. Sounds simple, right? It would be simple, except that Ashardalon's card is in that deck, too. EVERY time we play this scenario, Ashardalon's card shows up late in the game, usually when the healing surges are already used up. Still, this game is quite a bit easier than Castle Ravenloft, tougher than Legend of Drizzt.

The very favorite toy that the kids were able to play with tonight was the stacking set I purchased for our grandson who is 16 months old.  His Daddy was showing him how to stack the buckets when the three 2 year old grandchildren and the four year old caught the act and started to play with them, too.  It quickly became apparent that I should have bought four more sets for the other grandkids as well - and maybe even one to have a grandma's house.  The kids loved stacking the buckets, and then fitting them inside of themselves and figuring out the size differences and what fits and doesn't fit, etc.  Very educational for all of them.

So, in the end, that's what I did. This game drove me back to roleplaying games, first by tricking me into feeling like I was playing one for a while, and then by grossly running over its stated duration of play on more than one occasion. WoA is just what it says on the tin, a boardgame rather than a roleplaying game, and it is certainly cleverly done and has high production values. I like it. But I don't love it.
4584	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I absolutely love this game!  It's always different, and can be played by many different age levels.  Even my mother, who has Alzheimer's, can play a simplified version.  We do crosswords, and she builds separate words - but still "dumps" and "peels"  with the rest of us!  My problem is this.  I love this game so much, I gave my original game to my parents, since my mother also enjoyed it a lot.  I ordered two more.  The original set has heavy tiles - weighted and smooth.  Very nice to manipulate.  The new version has cheap lightweight plastic tiles.  Ugh.  The learning value is the same, but the cheaper quality of the materials bothers me.  The lighter weight tiles seem to fall more easily, and are not as durable.  One fell on the floor and inadvertently got stepped on...and it cracked.  That would not happen with the original tiles.  So - look around for those older sets!

And, this is truly a support ship in many ways; it cannot attack per se (i.e., it has no primary or secondary weapons).  There are, however, a few notable ways this ship can inflict damage on another ship: (1) see "Slicer Tools" upgrade below; (2) small or large ships -- YOURS AND THE ENEMY'S -- that run into this ship roll one attack dice and take any damage rolled; (3) huge ships that run into each other each automatically take one damage each; and perhaps most impressively, (4) when a huge ship executes a maneuver were the final position overlaps one or more small or large ships -- YOURS AND THE ENEMY'S, all of those ships are destroyed immediately. REALLY! I'm not kidding about this (talk about the importance of flying casual). The only small consolation for an opposing squad is that when this happens the huge ship has to roll one attack dice for each small ship and two attack dice for each large ship it destroys, and suffer any damage rolled.
7477	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Excellent

I am going to keep playing this game until I'm done with all the challenges and I'm pretty sure that my kiddo will want to try to finish more on his own. This game is a wonderful brain game. It soothes me sometimes in between all my blog writing and book reviews. I'm hooked on it. I'll be a bit sad when I completely finish it, but maybe I will start them all over again and try to time myself to make it even harder? Sounds fun to me.
6855	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my nephew who is 6. He was instantly enthralled with trying to find a way out for the red car! I watched, and I too got caught up in this game. My son is 12 and he now wants one! I recommend this! Don't be swayed by the 8 and up necessarily.

The artwork is very cool and fans will enjoy the characters and places from HP Lovecraft novels.
8828	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This drum is great.  I am always skeptical about products with lots of 5 star reviews, but it deserves it.  The sound is clear and the sticks that come with it are perfect for my 3 year old.  I also like that the drum is a bit on the heavy side, so it's hard for her to accidentally tip it over when she invariably gets up and sprints around.  My only gripe is a minor one; the design wrapped around the drum has a noticeable seam.  I wish it were tiled seamlessly.  Not enough to warrant a star off though, the product is great and I am totally happy with it.
9260	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Gave this to my (then) 2 year old. First without batteries in it, and she loved it, playing with the moving pieces by themselves was fun for her. Then we added the batteries and got it moving. She loved it! Now, another review said their 3 year old was bored after a few days. I don't know of many toys that a 3 year will play with for days on end. What you do is the popular technique called "hide it for 2 weeks then bring it out again when you need an hour to yourself".

Wiz-War is a competitive board game, and a chaotic one at that. You take on the role of a wizard who's trying to defeat all of the other wizards on the board. The goal is to be the first wizard to two points or the last wizard standing, whichever comes first. When a wizard is taken out, he's eliminated from the game.

2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.

Comes with basic 2.4ghz controller that has very good range, fully adjustable aluminum oil filled shocks that as you will see in the video do a superb job of keeping the wheels on the ground. Don't hesitate to buy this car, you will be very satisfied as long as you buy the batteries and charger. The batteries are only $15.99 ea. and you can get a good charger for around $100. Buggy is tough, I drive mine extremely hard pretty much every day and have done so for almost a month now and have had nothing break. Bottom line, enjoy the video and enjoy your new tacon soar.

356	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Expansions (2 in this bundle), can be played individually or concurrently allowing players a wider range of options. The inclusion of corruption tokens on one expansion board increase agents advantage but reduce overall points means game scores can be a lot higher than with the base game. While the other is just a mix-up of standard board choices. Added buildings and lords add more variables to the game as well, and can bring new life into what might be getting to be a dull game if played too often. As with the base game, good strategy is needed to take most advantage of the added possibilities.

It says on the box that it's perfect for travel, but I can't think of travel situation where the board might get tilted, but not bumped: certainly not a plane, or a car, or a boat, or on the beach, or on the grass.

I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape, both great games giving hours of replayability, and obviously high quality of design and materials. This one disappoints. All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition. The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS. FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity. Some of the pieces, like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4" in height and diameter.  The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well. The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old's hand. The board is quite large, about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard. Not much here folks, especially for the cost of the game. This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price.

Unlike many other games in the genre, this game is fully cooperative.  There's no solo player controlling the dungeon and the monsters.  Because of that however, there is going to be a bit of reading involved in any play session.  Players end up controlling monsters on their turns as well as acting for their hero character.  The monsters however follow a set of instructions located on each of their cards, sort of like a simple AI computer program.  It works out fairly easily and is a lot of fun.

The only bad thing about Mastermind would be the time it takes some players to make a guess. We resolved the problem using a chess player's clock.

This one is so simple and you really get into it. I have yet to meet somebody who didn't thoroughly enjoy it! I think the fact that the game goes so fast as opposed to say Monopoly, is a big selling point but even the most reluctant participant will want in once they hear one round of this game go off...all the yelling and passing cards back and forth is too much fun to pass on.
The story takes you through learning the major mechanics of the game and dice. The story is also pretty engaging so that helps. I have GM'ed a couple of times before but had never GM'ed Star Wars, so the included walkthrough story really helps.

- Third, this teaches logic by not only having to break the code but also the other player has to translate their opponent's guess into the white/colored pegs.  It all really helps the kids with their thinking skills.  True, once you've figured out a basic strategy the logic part starts to become secondary and it can be a formulaic game (my kids haven't gotten there yet).  But I still enjoy it.  I stopped using my color elimination strategy, I'm not in it to beat my kids, but to enjoy the game with them.  And then it makes me think!

If you are getting one set, I would recommend getting 2 and squirreling the second set away as a gift or "secret replacement" should one of the monkeys "go missing" as they are not easy to find/replace. Just tried and true advice from this parent! (I know several reviewers have commented on the velcro not holding up but given the number of times they are used before it gives up the ghost, not a deal breaker.

9923	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My son just loves these eggs! I really like that he has to match up a shape and a color to get the eggs put back together. One thing that I don't like about other shape sorters is that kids can shove the wrong shape through different holes and then you completely miss the point. With this sorter, the only option is the RIGHT SHAPE! Otherwise, the eggs just won't fit together. Great idea!

The game is a pretty short one if you have a little time to kill with just two players and each of your games is going to be varied with 50 different characters.  The gameplay is reasonably easy but the sheer volume of different powers to read and learn make it a little less accessible.  This game fills a really nice niche of quick 2-player games that is hard to find.

3818	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	this game is awesome.  it is actually quite easy to pick up and start playing out of the box, with a steep learning curve and lots of strategy.  very interesting asymmetrical gameplay - one person plays defense, while the other offense.  very slick, unbelievably balanced.  i'm still learning, but i find i like it more and more...
If you're interested in diving into a new competitive card game, then AGOT: LCG 2nd Edition is definitely worth a try. However, if you're looking for a casual party game for fans of the TV Series, then this game will be too complex and complicated for a casual fun experience.

Another nice thing about the game is really how cheap it is.  Now this might not seem that way to a traditional board gamer.  But anyone who has delved into the CCG market knows this to be true.  While a competitive Magic the Gathering Deck can easily run $200 up to a $1,000 or more depending on the format, you can get a playset of every single Netrunner card up to this point (7/28/14) for less than $300!  You can even tournament play for less than that.  And actually be competitive as well.

The quality of everything is VERY good, so this game is going to last a long time.  Very replayable, and even supports playing solitaire (for those nights when everyone is out of town).

After trying a couple of different drums, this one is the best.
Also, its MUCH better than Magic: The Gathering in my opinion. The main reason for this is Netrunner has a limited number of actions per player per turn. This eliminates the overpowered combos of MtG, and 10 minute turns. Its much more balanced as well, with very few (if any) truly broken combos. Also, you don't have to draw into your resources (mana in MtG), you can gain resources at any time. This means getting a bad draw in Netrunner happens far less than MtG.

If you want games that have a positive impact on your children or your family, these are absolutely the way to go.  We can sit and play a half dozen of Family Pastimes' cooperative games with only very good feelings at the end of game night, which has a lasting positive effect on my children's relationship with one another and on my sanity as a mother. Another nice aspect of these games is that they have a nice narrative quality.  We especially like this little game of mystery and memory, which is a race against the clock.  It's a favorite of my daughter, who enjoys Nancy Drew and mysteries.

349	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Yes Quick, wonderful and accurate
It is simple on the surface, quick and easy to learn, yet complex and fun to play over time.  This isn't a game that gets old quick.  Each game is a little different due to different character placements and different strategies.  I recommend this for players 12 and up, or perhaps some younger players with adult guidance.

-Unique tasks and assets are an interesting concept that works out well for the game (although it is one other deck to keep track of). The tasks themselves provide the player with a bonus objective, usually requiring a level of sacrifice, but with a substantial reward. The unique assets are similar in the way they are acquired, but I believe this feature could've been integrated into one of the original assets instead of forming its unique deck (see "feature creep" below).

Gale Force Nine has managed to bring the theme of the show to a board game in a way that doesnt feel pasted on nor does it feel trite. Players order their crew (workers) around with burner phones to the various location cards where they can buy or sell guns and edge out the competing clubs.
1140	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Novel and lots of fun!  The number of players is quite limited because of the finite number of tracks available, so be aware of that.

You may keep one route, or all three. Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete. You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to "buy" your route. The person who gets the most points at the end wins. Very easy to play. It is my 9 year old's favorite game. We love it so much, we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe.

2236	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We are a board game family and this game by North Star Games proves to be another fun game.  There is a judge who has the SLICE-O-MATIC 6000 which is the voting mechanism.  The judge will choose a card from the pile and pick a question to read.(There are 3 questions on one side of the card and 3 on the back, however play with the yellow cards first.) Player will write down what they think is the best answer and lay the answer card which they wrote on with the provided markers in the center of the game table.  Do this fast though!  Once all players have wrote down an answer, the judge will choose a player using the slice-o-matic with the answer they like best, but they do not show it to the players, they lay if face down.  Now scoring begins.  With the tokens players will place them next to the answer board they think the judge liked best.  That is really the gist of it.
Overall, if the basic idea of this game interests you at all, don't let the learning curve deter you.  This is a very much worthwhile game to learn.  With the core set, you get everything you need to start playing and you get a general idea of inherent strategies that go along with the 7 different factions.  There are 3 runners and 4 corporations and they all play very differently.  Going through each one and trying out different matchups adds a ton of longevity just to this set alone.  There's some limited deck construction options which can also drastically change strategies.  If or when you start getting bored of this, there are data packs you can buy.  This adds another 60 cards for more customization.  These data packs are also fixed, so you know what cards you are getting and you can look at lists to see what data packs improve you're specific strategy.  I'd also like to add that many reviews mention deck building, but this isn't a deck building game like Dominion.  The decks here are preconstructed.

At the moment it is setup going into a small tent, which he thinks is so much fun. My best tip for this tunnel is to put it away on occasion.  It is pretty big so when I notice he hasn't played with it for a little bit I pack it up.  When I bring it out a week or two later it's like he has a new toy.
6704	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My daughter adores this rattle. It is the first toy she grabbed and held onto. It's colorful handles attract her and the beads move from one sphere to the next. As soon as it's in her grip, the sphere is in her mouth. She'll gum this toy all day if I let her. I haven't had any problems with it hurting her gums as some of the other reviewers did. However, she does occasionally knock herself in the head with it. The manufacturer isn't at fault for that....it's just babies' developing hand-eye coordination.  It's very light, despite it's appearance and she never gets hurt. She's been interested in it since she was 3 months old and her attention hasn't waned yet. Lamaze comes through with another winner!

5597	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	If you know anything about Lovecraft or the Cthulhu mythos (which I'm assuming you do because you are on this page) you know that Lovecrafts works have an overlying theme of chaos, madness, and insanity. That theme fits extremely well with Fluxx! The rules can change in an instant and you really cannot predict how the game will go, which makes it very replayable. I suppose you could also think of it as Calvinball the card game. It also manages to feel very Lovecraftian (unlike some other themed versions of games that feel identical to the originals only with different characters). I've only played it with two people, but I can imagine that it would be just as fun, if not more so, with a lot more. Games last anywhere from 5 minutes to 45, depending on how the cards fall. The boyfriend and I have been playing this about every Sunday since we bought it, that that was months ago. I would highly recommend this game!

The first time we played, I brought the game along to a game night where there were a total of 5 guests.

The game consists of a bunch of blocks with colors and shapes on them.  There are six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple) and six shapes (from circles to stars and diamonds).  There are three sets of all color and shape combinations, so there are 108 blocks in the game.  While the game comes in a box, it also includes a bag for drawing, which is very helpful.

I had three people all completely drunk play it for the first time and they all figured it out. Though I would not recommend playing with drunk people as they take forever to take their turn and have to take frequent urination breaks.  I would suggest using an egg timer for those fun sponges. My daughter is 5.5 and she figured it out. I mean she didn't completely get the strategy but she knew how to play the first time out. So it's not too complicated. Others have mentioned they don't like when their routes get blocked. Boy so many comments I could make to those crybabies. This is the god damn industrial revolution people welcome to 'Merica. I can't hear you ducks quacking becuase I'm up here soaring with the Eagles. I like the quickness of the game played it four times with friends at a cabin last weekend. I actually think I enjoyed it the least of the five or six people who played and I am still giving it a five star review because I really feel the replay value is there and also like I'm just scratching the surface of some of the complexity of the strategy that can be used.
4962	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Concept seems easy enough. Match by color or symbol.  Use a single level, or let it trail across the table.  In the beginning,  scoring was a bit difficult to master.  But, I think this game will grow on the kids.

These are not tunable and mine are very high pitched, but my three year old son thinks they're fantastic. These are the perfect blend of toy drum and a "real" instrument. Perfect for young musicians.

I understand the rating is lower because previous versions of this had a higher quality of components. To me the component quality is alright for the $30 price tag, and overlooked in these complaints is the quality of the stock cards which are of good print. I honestly would not pay for a more expensive version of this game because while I enjoy playing it as a basic game of economics, there are a few problems. The tile draws can be quite random, there is no player elimination but a bad bet early on can eliminate a player from making meaningful plays due to him/her having his money tied up in a company that doesn't get bought out.

7782	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a fun game, but as others have mentioned, it is easy for your piece to shift off your space, and cause you to forget where you were, and the grid has numbers that are a bit too small, making room for the illustrations.

I'm happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and "reads" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is "Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).

UPDATE: We've now had this tunnel for several years, and despite much use and abuse, it is still in great shape!! My oldest was 3 1/2 when I wrote this original review. She recently turned 8, her younger sister is 6 1/2, and they now have a younger brother who is about to turn 3. They all still LOVE this tunnel! It gets dragged out every so often for everything from building tents to pretending to be dogs in a doghouse to walking around with it over them like a sock and pretending to be a monster. This is probably one of the most useful, long-term toy purchases we've made. I can't think of any other toy we have that has been used this often and has retained this much favor with kids of both genders over so many years and ages and interests.

1518	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a great game and is easy for anyone who can count up to 6. So you should be able to find someone to play with at all times.

4222	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This  is perhaps the best time travel game in existence. In this game, you are a Time Traveler, with a Secret Mission, a Secret Identity, and a very important job to do: Paradox Repair. You can win by fixing enough Paradoxes, gathering up the three rare and amazing Artifacts listed on your Mission card, or adjusting history in the three ways necessary to allow your character to return to the alternate reality from which he or she originally came. The constant changing of history is tracked by a special layout of 32 cards, called the TimeLine, which functions rather like a gameboard. The three ways to win provide for several different plotlines and layers of action, but you can also split the game up into two less complicated games: Solonauts (The Solitaire Game of Changing History) and Artifaxx (The Fluxx-style Game of Collecting Amazing Stuff).

5483	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	The Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer DVD game was a bit tricky to understand at first but once underway it made for a great evening of family fun.  My 6 year old son was excited when he saw the box and after a bit of setting up and explanation we were able to get into the game.  The game essentially has you rolling dice and moving around a game board.  In order to collect tokens you need to answer questions on the DVD.  Most of the questions are geared for young children so there is more fun than critical thinking involved but enough difficulty to keep adults interested.  The game play is approximately 30 minutes.  For the price this is a great game that that young kids will really enjoy.
VERY FUN!!
  buy a route (lay down your trains on the rectangles between cities)  You buy the track by discarding from your hand the same number and color of cards of the track where you lay down your trains.
1004	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game should be in everyone's collection. I agree with the age 8+ recommendation, because it does take some strategy and planning. Think Catan minus trading. You buy tickets from one location to another and then strategically map out and build a route using colored train cars. When playing with 4 or more players it can get difficult to take a direct route to your destination, so strategy is key to keeping up. I would recommend this game to people who are willing to sit and play for an extended period of time and are familiar with/ready to learn strategy games.

8670	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a fantastic sensory toy, and will delight kids for years! The only downside, and the reason that I'm knocking a star, is because the connecting red pieces are mostly swastika shapes, which, while understandable within the design, is still unsettling when one of them breaks and you're tracking tiny red swastikas through your home trying to find out which of your kids toys is the culprit.

Cons: its noisy especially at the slow setting, and my son liked it on, so even if we switched it off, he would walk over and switch it on even if he was not playing with it right then.  Get rechargeable batteries!

Beatle fans will certainly want these figures and will avidly grab them up and proudly display them. You can play Beatle classics from 1965 (that was a fertile year for them musically as well as artistically - that was the year their second film "Help!" was released) and enjoy some retro fun! Be sure to get the other Beatles for your collection.  You might also want to get "Beatle Toons" by Mitch Axelrod.  That is an excellent book about the Beatles' cartoon.

1740	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This has become such a wonderful tradition for my five year old. We love seeing the adventures of our elf Zart,.
The only reasons I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars are (1) the 1910 expansion is so essential that it really should have been included in the base game, and (2) once you've played this version a few times this particular map will start to feel a little simple.  Knowing what I know now I probably would have started with the Europe map and 1912 expansion instead (a little more to it at first, but lots more ways to grow into the game). But, this is still a great way to learn the game, and if you happen to be from the U.S. it will be a little easier to find the cities since you'll know where everything is.

While it does say that the minimum amount of players is 2, this game really shines when you have at least 5 - 8 players.  With only two players, if one of those players gets a few lucky rolls early on, it's hard for the trailing player to ever catch back up, and you miss out on the excitement and tension of what happens in the turns, the possible collisions, and the strategy element.  If you only have 2 people, I suggest each player playing a race team (consisting of 2 cars of matching color) each so that there is a total of 4 cars playing.

6478	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Who doesn't love trouble?  A big place for this game, as a parent of small children, is that the dice is encased in the dice popper.  This means no diving under the table to grab dice that are flying everywhere, no grabbing for dice from the next small person in line, no losing the dice.  It's a simple, fun and easy game for families to play together.  Even young kids (4+) can play on their own, and parents can enjoy it as well.

1368	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game is very easy to learn (I don't understand any of the negative reviews saying it's "too complex") and lots of fun, as long as you're not the big loser in any particular game. Imagine getting hemmed in and locked down in Settlers of Catan, multiplied by 100. That's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which (unbeknownst to you at the time) conflict with someone else's ambitions. Satisfaction with the game is very hit and miss, as it can be VERY tedious when you have no chance of accomplishing your objections. Part of the appeal of the game is also one of its biggest drawbacks: you can easily see how well you're doing compared to everyone else, which means that you can also tell very easily when you have no chance at all of winning.
5833	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was a gift for a 10-year-old granddaughter.  They are extreme!  Most pages have scenes with hundreds of dots.

The last thing the box introduces are institutions.  These are similar to Guardians except they're man-made and man-run organizations like the Miskatonic Univeristy, the Crime Organization and the FBI Bureau.  Since we've played a few games with all of them, my players (and most everyone on the net) think these cards weren't thoroughly play-tested.  All of them could have been tweaked just a bit.  And this may be the most disappointing thing as I read the previews on these organizations I was pretty excited about seeing a semi-new mechanic being introduced but now, it's a shame that they just weren't play-tested enough.

2550	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My daughter enjoyed decorating this journal.  It comes with a tube of puffy paste "frosting"  with a decorative rosette tip. It also has very detailed instructions on how to pipe the puffy paste into rosettes or shells and how to apply the charms.  I suggest practicing on a piece of cardboard to get the technique down before decorating the journal.  We had a few mishaps and had to wipe the journal off and start over.  Once applied, there are a multitude of stickers, jewels and charms that can be pressed into the wet frosting.  The puffy paste dries firm, but just to be safe, she displays her journal on a stand so it doesn't get damaged. She's eleven, and she ended up with the  paste everywhere and it's not water soluble.  A magic eraser took it right off  though.  In hindsight, putting down newspaper would have been a good idea.

5939	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	My rating may seem too critical, but it's honest.  The mechanic of flipping a card to upgrade sounds great in principle, but really makes for a very poor experience when implemented.  Because the cards are two sided, shuffling becomes a very tedious and awkward experience.  You don't want to look at the cards while shuffling, because that would be cheating.  So you shuffle under the table.  But then if you drop the cards your current game is completely messed up.  It's a novel concept, but a horrible when implemented.

  Others have mentioned that it is too much like Euchre - this is not true. While there are some similarities Rook is a MUCH deeper game. In turn, the levels of complexities make it much more entertaining. "Skilled" Rook players will almost always beat those who are less advanced - due to their ability to manage the game and the flow of points... regardless of how the cards are dealt.

I realized after a week that if you like this game alot then your going to NEED a player as interested as you are in this game to keep interest.  I have a great roommate that I always play board games and LOL with all the time, but he likes to mix it up a bit, while I would prefer playing this over and over.  I honestly wouldn't suggest purchasing this game if you are going to play it casually (i.e. once a month).  This is the kind of game that you try to play AT LEAST 5+ games a week and I think thats undershooting it considering that you can take the game out of the box, play a game, and clean up within 15-20 minutes (Agricola takes me 5-10 minutes just to setup the board...)

The pictures on the cards are fun to look at at you can tailor this game for younger players by spelling simplier words.  We've had lots of fun learning how to spell words and challenging some of the stranger words we spell.  (My friend even looked in the dictionary for some ideas to use for the harder letters like X, Q, and Z).  You can get points for having the longest word or the most words and the letters you use to spell the words and you can play with just two players.  It's fun and fast to play, highly recommended.

As they get older they pretend to play store and can work on number recognition. Just put the money away if you have little ones around as they might eat the coins or rip the dollars.

The Review
2107	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Wanted a fair skin, blue eyed elf for my blonde, blue eyed grandchildren which is hard to find. This elf is perfect and very well constructed. The book that accompies it is educational and adds the sense of reality for the non-believer! Pricing for the elf is the best I found in my 2 years of searching for it. My daughter puts it up the day after Thanksgiving and moves it every day. The children look for it first thing every morning and it adds to a positive and joyful discipline experience. They "know" they are being watched by Santa's elf and never know where the elf will show up. It is absolutely a family tradition that maintains a child's heart. I hope they never lose it.
It had a very strong smell when it came out of the package, but it seems to be airing out quickly. Folds up easily and takes up very little space.

The quality of the book seems nice, or at least what you'd expect. The pages are a decent weight (not cheap/thin paper) and are nice and white.
I love how the app works with the game.  It mixes things up each round and keeps the tension level high and players on their toes so they can never really plan too much ahead of time.  This also does a lot to eliminate the "alpha gamer" problem some players experience in cooperative games.  With just a short amount of time to take each of your actions in the timed phase players can only really worry about what their role is responsible for.
9786	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This has been a great help to my daughter. She likes it, and we like that she can practice on her own. We have seen an improvement in her memorization of her multiplication facts.

However, $12 for this many custom dice is actually relatively affordable - certainly less of a cash grab than other Fantasy Flight Games efforts. The dice are affordable, beautiful, and the way they work really adds a lot to the system they coincide with. Don't try and use the chart that translates normal dice.
9236	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I got this as a gift for my nephew.  He loves it.  There are so many different ways to play with this.  Tomy makes good quality stuff.
I bought this for the whole family, remembering how much fun my siblings and I had playing board games - something I fear is lost on the video game generation. Thus far, only my 7 yr old and I have played the game. He loves board games and I have bought hem several variations of Monopoly. It takes a few plays - and several trips back to the instructions - before the strategy and beauty of the game begin to unfold. Once you've mastered the details of the rules, one can concentrate on trying to build one's railroad empire. Then, you will have days of wonder.

1082	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Fun party game but not so fun you want to play it constantly over and over. Its a good game to pull out every once in a while with a group for 4 or 5. Ticket to Ride is not too difficult to learn we had kids playing as low as 8 years old but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under that age. I bought this game for around $35 but I think it's worth it at about $30.
9997	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My daughter loves playing with this.  It is sturdy and kid proof as well.  Kids have fallen onto it and it springs right back into shape ready for action.

5160	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I'm on sort of a game kick these days.  I have three kids, ages 6, 5, and 3.  I bought this game as a family present from Santa this past Christmas.  This game is for really anyone.  It's a cross between scrabble, dominos, and rummy kub.  It has colorful wooden tiles and a draw bag comes in the box.  The box is really nice.  The game was Germany Spiel des Jahres a couple years back, which is saying something, since achieving that rank is sort of a worldwide recognition.  This game is light, easily played, and easily scored.  But it still takes some strategy and brain useage.  My 6-yo gets it.  My 5-yo will get it soon; she usually plays on my wife's "team."  My 3-yo won't get it for a while, but he likes to build things with my tiles while I'm playing.  We put the kids to bed and me and my wife played alone.  I bought this game for my mother-in-law too, and she was way excited.  This same company makes another game we bought called Q-Bits.  My 5-yo and 6-yo get that game, it also is a high quality wooden game, and it's also a thinking game.  I have to say BIG thumbs up on Santa.  My only recommendation...I bought my wife a waffle iron too.  So now I have waffles and we play this.  A man's gotta eat, ya know?
2026	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We started this just after Thanksgiving and continued until Christmas Eve. My children are 3 and 5 and they loved searching for our elf every morning to see what silly position he would have gotten himself into. Very fun and the book is cute too.

708	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my 4 year old. We are trying to teach her about money. I will agree that this is just three separate banks kept together with a rubber band but I love that it divides it into 3 categories: Spend, Save and Share. It helps me teach her that there is more to money than just getting it and spending it. I will say I have not looked into this program beyond getting the bank so I can't comment on any other aspects...just the bank. I also love that this is a metal bank instead of something breakable like ceramic or glass and also more durable than plastic.
769	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a future classic board game like Monopoly and others, but is a far better game than any of those past classics. Everyone should know how to play Ticket to Ride. It is an easy game to play with good strategy involved if desired. This is a great game to play with family due to its simple rules.
The "game" is simple, you try to do tasks on cards and when you do, you get more Mardi Gras style beads.  Sadly, the game doesn't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party, it simply becomes a hassle.  Essentially there will be one person really into it, going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else's attempt to enjoy the party.

The index is also particularly vexing. In at least one case the only reference to the subject I was looking for resolved (eventually, after much searching the page text) to a stupid joke post-it. Call me finicky, but indexing the jokes in preference to actual useful entries is unhelpful and worth dropping one star. Indexing them at all was a questionable decision in my opinion.

5867	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Battlecon Devastation of Indines is an amazing game by designer D.Brad Talton Jr. This is a board game reminiscent of Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, or any other awesome fighting video games. But this game is so much more then just fighting, there are so many different modes to play with this one game, there is 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 tag team, 2 vs 1 boss mode, 3 vs 1 boss mode, 4 vs 1 almighty boss mode, dungeon guest solo, dungeon quest team. Theres so much that I could play just this game for about a month and maybe play every variant. There is 30 different fighters to choose from, and each one plays and feels so much different that it's amazing. When I got this game I didn't know to much about battlequest the dungeon mode, so I will go into a little detail about that. There are 6 different dungeons to explore, and each one is very difficult but very rewarding if and when you beat one. There is an armoury you can pick and use different items with in game gold, and it is extremely hard, but its a great place to try new fighters and to figure out how they play. And at the end of each dungeon is a final boss battle that'll really just your skill. But it plays out the same from the players point where you need to play an attack pair from your hand, then you randomly deal out each monster in the dungeon room with you a card that is numbered 1-6 and depending on which card the monsters drew you look.at there chart, and that will tell you there priority, range, power, and any special effects they might have. Its great especially if you cant find anybody to play some battlecon with. The game it self in any mode plays the same play attack pairs, check who has priority then follow the beats for ability then attack, there's a great chart on the side of the board that has every step the players need to follow. I couldn't recommend this game highly enough, this one box has something for everyone, and every other battlecon game fits seamlessly into this game, so the number of fighters is up to how many different expansions you want. We give this game a perfect score 10-10 absolutely nothing to gripe about with this game. This game has it all

2184	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a very fun game if you have a group (4-6) people to play with. Everyone takes turns drawing cards. One person draws a card, while the other people write on dry erase boards. The idea is when its your turn to draw a card, you read one of the questions on the card (there's multiple questions to choose from on each card) then everyone else writes their answers to the question on their dry erase boards. The one who drew the card and read the question secretly picks the answer they like best. The remainder of the players vote on which answer they think the the person who read the question will like best. You get points if you guess correctly which one will be the favorite, and you also get a point if your answer was the favorite.

Perhaps its apparent that I get caught up in the game.  The little fighters are awesome and sometimes get flown from where they were amassed to the planet they are subduing before they get returned to the supply because, by gum, Im in space!  Theres never any battle, just a threshold that needs to be met to subdue.  The planets are pretty the cards are gorgeous.  The resource chips, though variously colored to represent different resources aren't limiting if someone is hoarding them, but they are kind of plain.  I suppose you might take this out of space and then you are looking for islands to conquer instead?  Man-o-wars are probably more expensive to make than the little fighters.

Han Solo is a great figure with both strong offense and defense. Offensively, he rolls 1 blue + 2 green dice when attacking, he can spend surges to gain accuracy and/or damage, and he has the return fire special ability, which lets him perform a free attack against a figure that just attacked but did not damage him.  Defensively, he rolls a white dice, and he can add a block for each evade he rolls.  Its also nice that he adds an auto evade to defending adjacent friendly figures.

Overall the game is fun, but there are some things users may not like as much as others. The most obvious is that the main story has been altered, and it doesn't fit in with the movie's plot. The process of gameplay is a bit unnerving at times. For example, a player might be told to put a toy token in a specific region, only to be asked to remove it in the same turn. There is a lot of set-up and maneuvering of game tokens in between most turns. The narrator's voice is a little irritating and his instructions and the animations can seem repetitive. The biggest drawback of the game and DVD combo, however, is that the layouts don't coincide with one another. The layout of the DVD menu shows the regions in this order: Great North Mountains, Elf Toy Shoppe, Reindeer Games Playground, Santa's Castle. The board shows them in this order: Santa's Castle, Great North Mountains, Reindeer Games Playground, Elf Toy Shoppe. This makes play a bit awkward as players attempt to find the corresponding space to select on the DVD menu.

Background: Remake of the game from the 1960's by 3M of the same name. The object of the game is to profit by connecting two or more squares to form a hotel. If two (or more) hotels end up touching, they merge, with the larger hotel (the one with the most squares) acquiring the smaller one. Money is made by buying shares in hotels and having them grow. Bonuses are paid out to the majority and minority shareholders, and the process is repeated until the squares are all used, or no legal moves are left.

Ticket to Ride is a great game for the casual or the serious gamer.  It is very simple to learn, but play can be quite complex due to competitive elements.  It has a great light feel such that you can still have a conversation while playing without feeling you have to concentrate overly much on the game.  That said, if you want to concentrate and strategize, there is still plenty of that to be done.  This game is ideal for a board-gamer like me: a serious gamer who mostly plays with casual gamers, since it appeals to both.

5882	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	As far as simple dice rolling games that carry a theme go, Dungeon Roll is the creme of the crop.  It is instantly fun and easily learned.  It cane be taught in minutes as the game is played.  A variety of characters to play as gives a new spin each time the game is played.  The game boils down to a push your luck model where players are delving further and further into a dungeon.  The higher the level the player chooses to venture into, the more dice that get rolled which means more monsters and more chances for the dreaded dragon dice to hit the table.  Three dragon dice and the dragon lair must be entered where the player will have to fight the dragon or lose all of their progress (and thus any chance at experience points that round!).
The only drawback I find is the amount of cards printed. The rules state that any deck can have only 3 copies of any given card, but some cards in the core set have only one or two copies. Thus, if you plan on taking this game seriously, you need to buy 3 copies of the core set to make sure you have 3 copies of all cards... and be left with a pile of other cards that won't be needed, but still good to have.
6359	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	The kids really like it, but I realized after I bought it that there are only 3 slots for paper money, meaning that some denominations need to be doubled up.  But, the kids (2, 6 & 8) really like it and that's what matters
If you want a fairly cheap game with great replayability and that's also the best gateway game on the market, I highly recommend Kingsburg. If you like Kingsburg but think something is missing, I also suggest picking up the expansion.

3. The edge battle mechanic is just a splendid idea. I've never seen anything like it (but I'm not a hardcore board/card game guy)
So, as much fun as WORD WITH FRIENDS is a great time, try this in reality!!  It's a challenge, if you let it be!
First, after repeated playings, you may find there may not be enough variation in the adventure card deck. It gets to be old hat.

6413	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I am 33 as of 3/26 and my first time playing Yahtzee has me hooked. I started playing "Yacht" in a popular CD-ROM from Sierra (you all know what I'm talking about, right?) and knew Yahtzee came from that game. Yahtzee is different with an additional scoring space - 3 of a kind, but has a depth and distinction all its own. I have both standard and the Deluxe Edition Yahtzee and love them both, although the Deluxe Edition is a little more special and appeals to the collector in me. The dice are gorgeous and you will be spoiled by the Deluxe Edition score pads as they are designed attractively. I love the dice cup and the dice tray - with dice HOLDERS!!!  A prior review of this game caused me to study and scrutinize the rules from both editions. I don't understand why that reviewer said you were no longer eligible for the Yahtzee bonus chip nor the Joker rule allowing you to score additional Yahtzee scores in the lower space scores. I absolutely mean NO disrespect to that reviewer or their review; it is great and inspired me to write this one, and to hopefully help. The Deluxe Edition and standard Yahtzee rules are identical in that you can place additional Yahtzees in the lower score spaces, only if you have free spots to put them and if you have already scored a Yahtzee. You do get a bonus chip/token for each 100 pt Yahtzee shown on page 7 in standard Yahtzee and page 6 in Deluxe Yahtzee. I regret not learning this wonderful game earlier in life and am playing catch-up with this and with other new games I've learned. Don't hesitate to get this Deluxe Edition of Yahtzee, do it for the collector inside you, it's worth every penny. Now if only Milton Bradley would only make Deluxe Edition Yahtzee score pads for sale ...

Pathfinder Beginner's Box: A 100-page fully bounded book on high-quality paper.  As with the Hero's Handbook, the bulk of this manual consists of a full array of tips and tricks on how to become a good game master, with advice on how to create your own stories, battles, and various other scenarios, as well as descriptions of enemies and specialty items galore, with a few advanced rules that are important for an experienced GM to be aware of.  However, for anyone that doesn't want to have to deal with any of that nonsense to play a simple session, the manual opens with a mini-module, an adventure with a back story and plot hook that tells of a menacing force killing off local livestock; the players investigate a nearby dungeon to find the source of these disruptions.  The game master gets a full ten-room dungeon to have the players explore, and there are a variety of enemy encounters and traps that will use the quick thinking of the players in order to resolve in the best possible way.  It's a well rounded experience that will use the talents of all of the classes in order to best the system and make it to the end.  More importantly, it's fun, and that's the whole reason we're playing this, isn't it?  Again, the manual manages to best the 4th Edition Dungeon Master's guide at what it attempted to do, while still being a resource that actually teaches you the full game.  This gets a 10/10.
8780	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Every first grader should have their own math shark!  It's the perfect tool for memorizing their math facts.  Timing themselves each time instills their internal desire to beat that time the next day.  Our family has used math sharks for early elementary mental math going into our second generation now.  That's not all.  This handy tool prepares students for math memorization beginning with one digit addition and subtraction and goes all the way to pre-algebra.  Take a look.  It's so worth the $40 to never have  to teach your own child math again.

The Agendas are held on Servers protected by "Ice" -- security countermeasures. These can be harmful or lethal to the Runner.

I consider this a really good investment.

I would recommend this game for anyone who plays dominoes, scrabble or any strategic tile game. Love it! The only addition I would make (this is by no means a complaint) would be to add a game version where the tiles are made of a more durable item, much like modern dominoes (ivory plastic type) or perhaps metal tiles.

5 of 5. Each race (faction) has a completely different set of advantages and one disadvantage. Each race also has a set of advanced technologies they can research, which further grant advantages and some even are a great counteroffensive (like rendering Romulan Cloaks ineffective).

My mom writes down a really good second place answer. And my niece asks me how old I am. This appears to have been a question designed to help her to choose an appropriate artist - she wrote down "Elvis Presley." To her credit, she spelt it right. Unfortunately for her, that is not on my list. I choose my answer and chaos ensues - my mom can't believe it, my dad is gloating, and my niece wants to know just what is wrong with Elvis - I mean, it's her grandpa's favorite! Then it's my niece's turn - her question is "What would I want my name to be?" As it turns out, it's a closely guarded secret, since I've never once even heard her say the name Chloe let alone know that she wanted to be called that. And so it went. "What beverage would be the worst replacement for milk in cereal?" "What would your superhero name be?" We were in tears from laughing so hard most of the game.

It wasn't always this way though.  When I first tried out Netrunner I was actually pretty disappointed.  I had heard for years from gamers about Richard Garfields other CCG that didn't last long but was even better than Magic.  I even considered dropping money on a very steeply priced starter for Netrunner on Ebay.  But then I heard Fantasy Flight Games we re-releasing it.  And in an LCG format no less!  Constructible and fairly priced?  Sweet!  So I bought a core set.  And meh.  Thats how I felt.  The rules were complicated.  And it seemed like the runner always won.  Finally I gave up and shelved the game for a few months.  Then I was browsing the net and noticed that so many people were raving about the game.  Had I been unfair in my evaluation?  Maybe so.  I decided to give it another go.

* Fluxx expansion packs will work with Monty Python Fluxx. You can combine other full Fluxx decks, too. (Though Monty Python Fluxx has color illustrations on the card fronts, while some of the older Fluxx game card images are B&W line drawings.)
Each creature has a card numbered 0-10 that reflects their combat value for that round.  You can play these cards on top of each other, so you don't want to smugly throw that 10 on the Gorgon you're betting on in the first round, because your opponent can throw a zero on top of it at any time, and it's goodbye Gorgon and your points with it.  Plus you have "Spectator" cards that show unique creatures numbered 0-10.  These act like "wild" cards that can be played on top of any combatants still in the fight.  They can either bail you out or hurt your opponent, and additionally they void a creature's special ability if one is played on top of them.

My wife and I tried it the first time with our friends, where one quick game turned into six... it's actually a lot more fun then we were expecting. You play with game pieces that include handguns and stacks of cash, where the object of the game is to exploit and fight other players in the game. The rules of the game are a bit complex, as we played the first two rounds with the institutions in hand to get everything right, but you only play six rounds and the game is over pretty quickly (45 minutes to an hour).

5689	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	the Fluxx games are loved by kids and hated by grown ups.  IMO, this is because there is no strategy.  Randomness and Chaos prevail.  My girls love this, love how the rules change frequently and have lots of fun laughing when the Captain's Hat is out.
However, for the dedicated gamers who are GoT fans, this is definitely a fun experience as you build power to take the throne.  The cards are really nice looking.  I've always found Fantasy Flight Games to make nice games, and this one is no exception.
One of the coolest features of the game is the app, which can be downloaded for iOS, Android, and Windows. This app tells you everything you need to know, like how much money you have to spend, when to research new technology, where to deploy your troops and interceptors, as well as where the aliens are attacking.

The one thing that keeps this game at home, and not in my purse, is that it seems to take slightly (15-20 minutes) longer to play.  I don't know if it is the nature of the Python-specific Creeper cards designed to sandbag you from winning, or if some of the rules are just different enough from the basic game to make gameplay more complex, but my husband and I have yet to play a game of Monty Python Fluxx that takes shorter than 25 minutes.

2290	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love that the elf is posable.  The story is cute.  Although it was hard to hold my 3 year olds attention, he did sit through the story.
While the game is playable solo, it really shines with a full team of 4 players who are all working together to try to stave off the ever increasing threat of the growing alien forces. And that threat is real. Too much damage to the base? You lose. Too many countries panicking because you went overbudget, had too many UFOs left, or had a lot of random crises? You lose. Every game gives you that sense of tension as the numbers slowly start to overwhelm you, causing more countries to panic, which leads to less funding for the next round. The ultimate goal is to survive long enough for the app to tell you the final mission is available and then to complete that mission. The game can be brutal and the cost of failure in any mission is high, especially when one bad roll leaves a couple of your interceptors destroyed or several of your soldiers dead. That also makes a victory feel that much better.

716	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent game for 2-5 players, and especially for kids.  I was initially put off by the theme and the mentioning of winning the $1 million dollar prize on the advertisement.  I immediately thought there would be paper money involved and it would be like Monopoly where I would have to be a banker,,,and yech.  But no, I was WRONG. There is no fake money involved!  Just little cards with different colors.  Easy, but challenging. It is a game where you can be nice and not mess with your opponents supposed destination, or you can try and block them.  You get points according to the tracks you lay and connections you make.

It works well with only two players, so is one of few that is enjoyable for my husband and I to play by ourselves, but will also be good to play as our children get older and can join our games.

This book is the perfect skill level for someone like me.  I mostly can copy things right now, but if I draw something from memory, my lack of skill is apparent. That was my motivation behind buying this book.  I needed to build on my skills and this book looked like the perfect thing to help with that.

Generally speaking, the stater game is a better buy, it's only $10 more expensive than this product, and comes with some literature and adventures as well, but since I already had that, and I just needed dice, I was forced to get these.

While it is true that this is a key upgrade for ships with boost, I actually really like flying the Starviper. So far, I have only played Xizor and Guri but they are very good at arc dodging and they fill a role that is similar to an intercepter.

Ticket to Ride is a very simple, elegant, strategic, and above all fun game where your overall goal is to score as many points as possible by claiming train routes across North America. You do this by collecting train cards of different colors that match up with the various routes on the board in order to claim them. At the start of the game you are given tickets with different routes planned out and bonus points attatched to them depending on the difficulty of the route. The strategy comes into play because their are a limited number of routes on the board and the other players are also trying to claim them.

Much of what I come up with or have purchased, my daughter finds boring.  Not so with this math game!  She actually expected to find this game dull, but she is hooked.  She literally came to understand decimals much better just by playing with this "toy" for less than half an hour, and she enjoys trying to beat her previous timing.  It comes with a booklet that shows HOW to perform the various math operations if the child does not yet know how, then the game is used for practicing.  Once they are comfortable with a level, they can advance to the next hardest level.  This is the first math learning anything I've found that she finds entertaining, and it really does improve her math skills, so I'm happy, too!  It teaches several skills including adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, fractions, percents, decimals, and it can be used as a calculator, too.  My daugher said to give it 5 stars.

The game pieces are all plastic, not the cardboard with plastic slotted feet that they used to be. It makes them more durable for little hands as they can be rough with them. Plus without taking them off and on the plastic feet, it saves in wear.
The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.

Again, if you have never played a living card game than I would suggest you play the tutorial game that is suggested in the rule book. It is a shorter version but it will really help you get the concept of the game down. Suggested for 2 players. Which is the best as once you have mastered the tutorial game than you can bring in more players to see who can conquer for world dominion.

(3) It's a game of chance, so my child never feels badly if he's not the winner of the game.  We take turns taking the lead on the board throughout each game and, because the spinner dictates which square we land on, he doesn't blame himself if he doesn't turn out the winner every time. This is also a good lesson for him to learn!
Overall, if you are looking for a new game to play and/or are a big fan of Settlers (or other strategy based games), I would highly recommend this game for you.
Small and easy to carry with you, you can play it anywhere there's enough room for two decks of cards side by side.  This is a game the entire family can enjoy at home or on the go.
6608	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I just received this in the mail, and am so disappointed with the quality. I know it's not very expensive, but it couldn't have cost more than $3.00 to make. The box does not look like the picture here--it is white, generic-looking and is paper thin and flimsy, and I'm sure the game itself is cheap looking too. The box top does not lift off like you would think.  It is a Christmas present for my son, and he'll probably be fine with it, but what happened to the days when board games came in sturdy cardboard boxes that would last for years? Is there a specific company that still produces board games of quality material?


The variation that we have played at parties and at home is:
Simply draw one of the question cards.  Each player writes down their answer and the player with the highly prized Select-o-Matic 6000 becomes the judge.  The judge rules on who's answer is correct (well, maybe correct isn't the exact answer here - let's say that it's the answer that the judge loves the most).  Each correct winning answer earns points and the most points wins.  This is definitely a great party game adults would really love getting into with their wacky answers as well as younger children with their version of the answers to questions.

I started playing with some of my engineering friends, I'm an engineer as well, and we couldn't have had more fun.  Be prepared.  The rulebook is pretty extensive and can get complicated once you get into the advanced rule set.  We found the basic rules kind of boring and pretty exploitable, so pretty much started with the advanced rules gradually adding concepts the more we played.  Of course we found the playtime listed a little bit on the little conservative side.  Our games went on a little bit longer.

The conceit is that the players are the crew on a Gnome Submarine (don't sweat the gnome bit - it plays only a "color" role in the game). This submarine is the worst maintained craft to ever set sail and the crew spend all their time fighting fires, pumping floods, fixing the engines or the oxygen pumps or the reactor or the eager to self-launch missile armament.

Letters that are more difficult to use have higher point values, though there are some "Qu" cards vs. just a "Q" card, but that also makes a difference in points.  It's quick to play, easy to catch on to and very portable.  Scrabble is one of my favorite games, but takes seemingly forever to play - this provides a very enjoyable word game experience.

6115	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Not as good as prior reviews stated it was.  Not compatible for some flight games.

We play it so much that we don't even take the time to count of the points anymore as it's just fun to play the game.  Not many games can say that.

It's easy to take on the go like if you're looking for a good game to take on vacation (though NOT a car game, pieces will go everywhere if you try to play in the car).  Excellent for encouraging verbal creativity.  Bananagrams is very similar to scrabble but without the game board so you have more freedom to build words however you can.  This is a great game for encouraging kids to expand their vocabulary and get creative.

Cons:
9285	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I brought this drum for my one year old for his birthday. Hes a typical baby who loves to bang things so I decided a drum would be perfect for him. As I browsed around Amazon, I found many baby drums, but all of them looked like toys that can outgrow within a few years. When I saw the Remo drum, I knew I wanted to purchase it. Its something I could see him using through his adolescent years. Its not baby looking and thats what I wanted. The drum is very lightweight and comes with two sticks. Now, if you have a child who likes to put stuff in their mouth, I wouldnt recommend this product. Im not sure what the top parts of the sticks are made of, but they have a weird smell that I would not want in my childs mouth. Overall though, he loves the drums.

This is a very well made drum and more than worth the price.
In addition, the numbers are poorly formed. They are similar to some calculators, where the numbers are made up of straight lines but that's not the problem. The problem is that the lines have fairly large spaces between them which make the numbers oddly formed. When combined with how dim they are, it makes them quite difficult to read.

The game starts off by drawing a card and playing a card.  You can put keeper cards down as part of your turn but you may also play a rule card or goal card, etc.  A goal card changes the winning objective.  A rule card might change how many cards to draw during your turn.  The game gets crazier when players have cards to steal keepers or cancel actions.

Since there are way more destination cards included with the game than can be built during any one game, and since the shuffling of those cards, as well as the large number of colored RR car cards is large, the game is never the same twice.

This game is what is known as asymmetrical, meaning that each player has completely different mechanics and card interactions. Unlike games like MtG, where the turn order and card setup is essentially the same between players, this game has two different roles: the hacker and the corporation. The hacker tries to gain access to the corporation's files in order to expose wrongdoing, while the corporation builds defenses and tries to burn out the hacker and destroy his/her mind.

Anyway, as far as gameplay goes, what I really like about this game is you are playing a faction, or as fans might call them, a House (except the Nigh Watch which might be the reason for the faction statement. This isn't just a color or a visual difference. The cards you play are going to change based on this faction and therefore how you play might adjust itself as well. Since Jon Snow and Cersei have different strengths, you're probably going to wind up playing to the strengths of the best cards you have available. Although this is a deck-building game, there are nice suggestions on what cards to start with in a deck, and I always find that is the best approach to take until everyone is comfortable enough with the cards to choose a playing style.

CONCLUSION

Let me start by saying this game drags on and some of the rules just over complicate a simple game. Our game with 7 people took nearly two hours due to the fact that you are constantly passing the one lone dice set around the table. This game fills the void for huge groups, but other than that it is a pass for me.
stock battery gets 45mins-1hr. i use a 5800mah lipo and it makes it a little faster speed and after 2 hours the lipo is not dead. my 5800 is a tight squeeze to fit in the battery tray(length wise)

4518	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I had never heard of this game before until a co-worker introduced me to it. I must say that it awesome. It reminds me of that card game speed. Each person gets a set of tiles and when when everyone is ready you flip over your tiles, face up, and start making crosswords out of them. You can exchange out one time but you have to take 3 from the community pile and every time someone gets close to finishing everyone else has to pick up an extra tile and this goes on and on until the tiles run out or someone yells "Bananagram!" Then the fun begins with seeing what everyone else came up with. This game was loads of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Scrabble and/or Boggle.

It's a fun easy game to take to parties since it's easy to learn yet hard to master.

It's a great little project you can do over and over again........The paint pots that come with it are adequate and a separate gloss medium is a very thoughtful item to put into this kit.

Final verdict - Probably the best family card game ever invented. It will continue to entertain and challenge you and your family for generations- however- initially there will be growing pains as everyone tries to learn the rules and strategy.
The only reason I am not giving 5 stars, is the poor quality of the board and the game cards. They are made of thin cardboard and simply won't stay flat.

It keeps her occupied for hours (no easy feat) and she has to use her imagination to make her creations, which as a mom I like, especially in this age of technology.  I would most definitely recommend this product!  I would love to buy the bigger, more expensive set, but they are pricy (but they ARE worth the money).  I teach preschool and my preschoolers enjoy this as much as my 11-year-old and her same-age friends do.  They come in a very handy container bucket with a lid for easy storage when not using them.
This is a great addition to the X-Wing game in many different ways.  As usual the ships look great and include everything you need to play them (though the original starter set is still required). It has an MSRP of $60, but you can get it for as little as $40-50 if you shop around online.  It is definitely worth it as it adds the first huge ship and epic play rules, it includes tons of new pilots and upgrades for your Rebel fleet, a couple of which can also be used in Imperial fleets (especially when the start releasing huge Imperial ships). I do wish more of the upgrades could be used on Imperial ships the way many of the upgrades from Imperial Aces could be used on rebel ships. But, hopefully this will be rectified when they eventually start releasing huge Imperial ships to the game (I am looking very forward to that day).

And regarding the player conflict, called throw-downs in the game, it is resolved simply. 2 points for every member at the site and 1 point for every prospect. 3 points for every gun, and add the roll of 1d6  the largest sum wins. Each side using guns gets a heat token and if guns were used, the loser has a guy go to the emergency room and possibly die.  There are a finite number of members and prospects each player can have, so this forces early conflicts.

6255	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I give it 1 star only because it came ahead f schedule, other than that, how anybody else who knows anything about the rc world can give this thing more than maybe 2 stars is beyond me. Were do I start, lets see, got it May 29, ran it around for a bit and I was surprised low level crawler was doing really good. Took to crawl some rocks and dirt the next day, not even 24 hours out of the box and for some reason it started out good but after 10 minutes its not climbing anything very well, must be the battery, its dead. Charge it up, lets go again, oh wait, same thing, hmmmm, what could it be, oh wow look at that, the rear axle is pushing but front axle is just spinning. Ok so lets pick it up and test something, with the rear wheels on the ground it wants to push like its crawling, put the front down and pick up the back with the front tires on the ground and the driveshaft just spins and tires don't even feel like they want to move. Well to make this story shorter, rear axle started doing the same thing few hours later, so lets see if we can figure what happened, let me notify the seller also and see if maybe something is wrong with mine sine this has a 4 1/2 start review. Well I figured it out and the locker inside the front and rear axles is garbage, its not even a good locker, its cheap plastic, so I start looking for parts. Mind you I sent the seller a email about my problem so, now back to the parts thing, there are some but not much, most of the main stuff like the main gear they don't have, its out of stock like everywhere and don't worry the upgraded one is out of stock also. So now I don't know what to do, I have a crawler that doesnt crawl and also its beyond slow, maybe three to four mph. Next day, finally seller emails me back and informs me of a website, Nitrorcx.com and they have every part for this truck. Well since I was already at that site I knew that was wrong, I emailed them back and the basically told me I can return it and get my money back or get a new one but thats it, no more returns. So basically they are telling  me if I return it for a new one Iam screwed if something is wrong with that one also. I don't know what to do cause this was for my son who saved and worked is butt off for 2 months. This truck need modifications to be a decent truck, not good, decent. I don't think the regular person who doesnt know rc should get this truck cause as we all know you get what you pay for, as far as the seller, rude and unknowledgeable, if your going to sell something at least know the product before you ship me off to someone else.

For those that don't know the Light Side and Dark Side experience is different. Light side players win the game by attacking and destroying dark side objectives.

9963	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I really like this tent, but we broke it after just a few months' use.  I like the removable mat; it's thick & offers lots of cushion.  The price point was good for us.  We used it in the living room, the yard, and the beach with our ~1 year old.  Unfortunately, one of the plastic tubes of the poles bent and now the tent doesn't work quite right.  I will investigate getting a replacement.  Given that as an adult trying to be careful, I easily messed up the pole, I'm not sure how well this tent would stand up to abuses by older kids.  It's a cute tent, but be careful when you're setting it up & taking it down.
One of my favorite things is that the app provides a tutorial difficulty setting that pops up instructions for each role on screen to be passed around so everyone can read a brief set of instructions telling them what they need to know. Each role itself is fairly easy to get a grasp on, though they all have plenty of room for depth and strategic decisions. After getting your feet wet, you can increase the difficulty level for an even greater challenge, but also making victory that much sweeter! Though the difficulty can be a bit unforgiving at times, all the systems work very well together to give you the tools to create a tension-filled, thematic story. I would highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun co-op experience or just want to feel like you're saving the world!
2088	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This little elf is magic!  After the children have named him their behavior improves as you remind him/her that the elf is watching. Each morning the elf mysteriously changes position and it is great fun finding him and checking what he is up to. He hangs from the Christmas tree, dangles from the chandelier, and sometimes has tea with a Teddy Bear or on occasion Barbie. He can be dressed and redressed and loves to eat chocolate kisses which he forgets to clean up and leaves wrappers around and perhaps a smudge of chocolate left on his face. The genius is that the elf can't be touched by human hands. The children take this quite seriously. He flies to the North Pole to report to Santa which is a great encourager of good behavior. This worked on a charm on my less than perfect granddaughter (whom I love dearly).  I haven't heard one parent complain about this wonderful elf.

From time to time we get a little confused as to exactly what rules are in play or how we're supposed to apply certain rules.

Set up is pretty quick and easy once you are familiar with the game, but there is a bit of a steep learning curve before you get to that point. I don't feel that this detracts from the game at all. It's nothing near the level of Axis & Allies or even the C&C games. It's really just separating cards and tokens, drawing character cards and setting them up with the little skill sliders (a very neat component of the game) and money and items, selecting the Great Old One for tonight's game, and putting your character pawns on the their starting location as delineated by the character card. You then add clue tokens to those locations on the board that need them, and you are pretty much done. I store the different loose components in plastic baggies, but I would bet that putting them in a little plastic divider box would speed things up. There are some excellent card tuck boxes on the web. If you use these, the cards will not fit back in the insert in the game box, and I found that it's easier for me to use the insert in the box and then quickly separate the cards before play. You may find differently and I recommend that you at least try those tuck boxes...they are really neat. In any case, the set up is pretty quick and then everyone should be ready to play. I would think that 15-20 minutes might be an average set up time, and given that this is a set up for a 3 hour game, it's not too bad, and that's why I say that this is a *relatively* quick set up.

One remarkable observation is that my 10 year old grandaughter, who had no particular interest in Scrabble, loves Bananagrams and can even hold her own with adults players.
I did try doing the actual board game though, where you roll dice and actually try to move your token to the finish line.  After a while I got used to it, but even once I managed to juggle the remote and figure out what roll meant what and move the piece and keep score there was the issue of being complicated.  Still, it might be a thrill for a small number of youngsters (4 players max) who enjoy incorporating DVD technology with oldschool board games.

1500	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is such a fun game to play.  I love it because their is strategy involved but it is easy to explain it and play it right off the bat.  Their isn't a lot of instructions.  We love it and also played it online for 6 month strait after we got it.  Great for all ages and learn about where the different states are and places.

1466	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	As others have noted, this game is a perfect way to spend quality time with spouse and/or kids.  If nothing else, it can familiarize kids with geography, which is something kids do not seem to get enough of these days.  The game does not have the strategic depth of say Civilization or Chess, and for that some serious gamers turn their noses at this game a bit.  But that is not the niche this game serves.  This game is designed to draw groups of people together for the sake of having fun.  And for that purpose this game meets this goal and then some.  I can easily see our family playing this game once a week.  The rules are simple,  but don't be fooled:  just because this game does not have the strategic depth of some other games out there, there is still thinking and strategy involved.  There will be many opportunities in this game to foil your opponents and you are constantly asking yourself on a turn "Should I try to achieve MY goal, or should I block theirs?"  In my opinion, families who play Monopoly could repalce Monopoly with this game and would be glad they did.  This game sort of scratches the same itch that Monopoly attempts to scratch, only this game does it FAR better.  Monopoly does not have enough mechanics and variety to justify the time spent; Ticket to Ride does.

The basic idea in this game is to pickup resources to build trains on a large map of the US and connect as many cities as you can.  You have pre-determined routes to achieve by connecting certain cities to one another.  The trick and skill to this game is maximizing your network of tracks and connecting as many cities as possible...while keeping a continuous train.  The reason this game is so great is that you have a lot of activity at all times (picking up resources, connecting cities by placing trains on the board, picking up new routes/goals, etc.).  The other nice feature to this game and most Euro-games is that players are never fully eliminated.  Although someone might be far from winning, they are still in the game and can play a part.  The final part of this game which is so much fun is that once the final turn has been triggered, there is a big reveal of sorts where everyone shows their secret routes they were trying to achieve and gain points (or lose them!) based on their success.  The game can have many twists in turns in the final scoring.
1644	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	In LOVE!!!! New tradition with my kids!!!! 
People who are used to planning a few moves ahead will take a little longer to truly enjoy this game since the constant changing can mess up all their forward planning, but once you accept this unpredictability as a challenge in itself, then you can have some real fun with Fluxx.
- Some of the pieces are complex for my four year old to assemble. At the same time, I expect a kid 6+ will find this game overly simplistic
1137	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is such a fun game for our whole family.  It's a fun way to learn the location of the 50 states.  As a homeschool mom I am always looking for ways to make learning fun.  We play with our 7, 9 and 11 year old kids and they all enjoy it.
1006	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Ticket to Ride is a great game for both new comers to modern board games and for veteran players. I want to stress that the game takes on entirely different mechanics for people that play it often. When you first start playing the game, you stay pretty focused on simply making your routes and generally trying to stay out of other peoples way. It's not hugely interactive and can sometimes feel like multiple people are playing independent games on the same board, only interacting if their paths happen to cross. This completely changes when people get enough experience to start knowing the different routes by memory and start to be able to keep track of their opponents cards and draws. You can start to get a lot more intentional blocking and racing to claim certain key segments, which makes the game a lot more of an interactive and feel more "high stakes". It also doesn't ever really feel "old" or "played out". Great classic game.

1982	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This just seems like one of those instant classic toys. We starting using the Elf on the Shelf last year after our kids were asking about why we did not get an elf and so-and-so does. Within days it felt like we had been using the elf toy for years. Our children enjoy the hunt each morning, especially if Elf has been mischievous during the night. This always brings out big laughs. It does not take much effort to find a place for Elf to be each morning. No worries if Elf decides to stay put two days in a row...it must be a comfortable spot. Notably, Elf's legs have creases to bend, but the arms do not. That said, you can fold the arms, they just do not have creases built in.

6935	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was a Christmas gift and our LO loved it.  Has a nice amount of play money and the credit card and slot just put it over the top.  He loves to grocery shop and play cashier whenever he can.  As an added bonus we are now starting to count money and this set works perfectly for explaining and showing coins.
I agree that the character progression chart is redundant.  It's useful only if you are actively creating battle scenarios while playing your own adventure: though most savvy GMs will actually have a pre-made list of potential random encounters and an average xp and gp range to allocate.  Attacks of opportunity would have been more welcome... or there are several other things that are in the additional rules which would have made sense.

The only reason I didn't give the elf 5 stars is because you are expected to move the little critter every night to prove his magical abilities. It's not that hard once you get used to it. And if you do forget, come on, seriously, you can play it off. If you're relaxed about it, your kids probably will be too.
1452	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My wife and I like board games, but have a hard time finding new games for adults.  We first caught wind of this game on the YouTube show Table Top.  When we first got this game, we didn't quite understand the rules and went through a couple of rounds playing wrong.  Going back, the rules were pretty simple, we had just overlooked one thing.  This is the most used board game at our house and is far more fun for us than any of the games we had been playing (more traditional board games).  The quality is amazing, the cards are a heavier stock than a cheap playing card, which will help the life of the game, and the playing peices are nicely made.
9862	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	The closure on the carton is very flimsy. I can see it breaking in the near future and the eggs are pretty hard to open but my son still loves it!
5659	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I was dissapointed that the cards looks just like the original Fluxx.  The same border, text, and bland pictures.  Cartoon Network Fluxx is a much better example of how to do a follow up to the original.
The Comedy version has a lot of stuff from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s - probably more but I haven't experienced everything on the DVD yet.  I was really surprised when we had a question referencing the movie "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" - mostly because that movie just recently came out no more than 4 weeks ago.

8800	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Our daughter loves this car.  Hers was passed down from a relative, and is about 6 years old, but still looks GREAT!  It is east to clean, infact we make a game of it.  Hannah washes her car while Mommy washes her car.  I like that they have to push themselves around, I think it makes for more creative play.  This toy is just as good as any of the Little Tykes items.  It will last forever.
You will be surprised at your abilities (or lack thereof, of your opponents) and you will be entertained.  This game will be favored by those with the ability for abstract thinking versus concrete thinking.

You have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central "bingo board."  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.

You draw out destinations your trains need to go and you build tracks between here and there.  Other train makers can block your path on the way to their destinations and you may have to find another route.  We played on Christmas day and we had a great time.  This is a well made game and should be in every game-loving family.  We are considering purchasing the other versions as well.  Good times for all.

I currently have 9 different versions of this game, and after you master this one, I would suggest adding the 1910 expansion, or the Ticket to Ride Europe version.

If you do not have patience, or your children do not, and rather just "play" then I wouldn't recommend this game. It isn't a "turn key" game or a game that doesn't require time or patience. But if your children like legos or engineering, or building things in general, they might enjoy this game.
Overall, we were a little worried that our daughter was not quite ready for her very own operative, but we were pleasantly surprised at how much she talked about George.

Pirate Fluxx has great winning combinations like Keg of Rum, and Key Lime Pie, Surprises like That Be Mine and Avast!

Quirkle is essentially an abstract game, and can best compared with Scrabble, but with colours and shapes instead of letters.  If you enjoy games like Dominoes, Ingenious, Set, or Blokus, this tile-laying game will definitely appeal to you.
Speaking of decks, the game doesn't come with enough cards to put together a proper one. It comes with many different factions (there are a lot more factions than in the first edition base game) but there are not enough of these and the neutral cards to put together a tournament deck.

The rules are quite simple. Each player takes his turn being the judge and reads one of the pre-written questions from one of the cards from the stack. [Note: There are a total of 60 cards with three questions on each side.] The other players then write down an answer to the question. Once all answers have been submitted, the judge uses the Select-O-Matic 6000 (a cardboard spinner-like device) to select the answer he likes best and places the device face down. Next, everyone but the judge uses their two tokens to select the answer he thinks that the judge has chosen.

It succeeds largely by presenting a grand, epic scope of wars and conflict, dragons, and wraiths, but also manages to create interesting characters and tell intimate stories.  Other key factors in the books are treachery, intrigue, and betrayal.  Fantasy Flight Games' "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game" manages to recreate all of the thrilling adventure of the books, but most importantly offers that same great sense of back-stabbing and double-crossing.

9612	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This is easy to put together, a good size, easy to transport/store, but the opening is Velcro!! Why??! As soon as your baby can crawl/stand they'll push right out of it.

Things that are required-
There are cards you get that require you to connect your trains to 2 cities. You have to keep at least one in the beginning of the game, but can draw more later on. These become important for getting a lot of points. However, not connecting your trains between those cities means you lose points.

But as soon as your child can sound out words, he/she can not use these to quiz himself. The Spanish word is on both sides, so you have to cover it when wanting the child to respond to the picture without reading. But I agree with the other review - for ages 4 and under, these are nice, practical words that are useful for any level of Spanish learning.

The rules are pretty straight forward and easy to learn. Like most fun games it is easy to learn and hard to master. I've played this with my six year old and he gets the concept pretty well. The only thing we've done differently when he plays is we show all of our train cards rather than keep them secret.

Their strategy fails miserably with Chutes and Ladders.  Did Hasbro even product-test the new version?  First, I want to say, I think C&L is a great game. It's educational because it tries to teach beginner math skills and instill some morals through the pictorial depictions on the game board.  I have fond memories of playing it as a preschooler during the early 1980's (yikes), but this current version, which my daughter has, fills me with annoyance every time she drags it out.

He loves running around the house with it expanding it and saying "big", and then collapsing it and saying "small".  We play a lot of games with it and I am quite frankly surprised that we haven't broken it yet!  Yes, my 2 year old has had it for almost 6 months and uses it daily and hasn't broken it yet!  I am impressed.  It's a great learning toy that is also great for games and physical activity.  I would suggest this toy to other parents of small children.

A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed. is set up to play three to six players. With rules to adjust for the amount of players in the game. The game itself is not for the casual gamer per sey. It's a long game of strategy that can easily go over four hours but oh what a four hours it is! All the theme and feel you could ever want in a strategy game is locked in this incarnation. All the houses: Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Tyrell, Greyjoy and Martell, are in this game as you battle for territory in Westeros with political intrigue, back stabbing and hard fought war campaigns.

We got this new version since my original game has been long lost.  This version seems to have some design flaws though.  The storage compartment is difficult to close and is always getting pegs stuck in the tiny holes on the side.  I have given up using it and store the pieces in a separate bag.  Also, it is hard for adult fingers to put pegs into the code maker section.  Otherwise, it is a terrific game.

982	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My kids still play this game whenever there's a family gathering.  It's a favorite.
The only draw back I have for the game is that the rules are laid out poorly (I highly recommend watching the Watch It Played series on YouTube to learn the game very quickly)  Oh, and there is one rule that in my opinion kind of spoils the game.  At the end of the game each treasure that has not been used is meant to count as one experience point.  This encourages hoarding of treasures instead of using them to "push your luck" and delve further into each dungeon run which to me is the entire point of the game.  I highly recommend having a house rule where the only items worth experience at the end of the game are: town portals (worth 2xp if not used) and 2 dragon scales = 2 points (1 dragon scale = no points).  All other unused loot is simply discarded.  With this simple rule I have found the game to be much more even between multiple players and it no longer ends up being the guy who was lucky enough to roll the most treasure chests that wins by default.  Players are also far more willing to push their luck as they have no incentive to hoard items.
250	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was given as a gift and the recipient was thrilled. The game play is perfect for both advanced players of D&D and those who are just beginning.

Highly recommended.

*Although there are a lot of steps, once you get the hang of itieby the end of your first game, you kind of get the hang of what you are doing. Once everyone got it the game play was quick and fun.
8772	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My son got this for his birthday from his Grandparents when he turned One.  He loves it and so do the two neighbor toddlers.  They all fight over it.  My son turns it over and runs it into things and it has held up for 8 months now.  My husband will tell you it was a pain to put together and the stickers do not last on it.  Other than that the car has been a huge hit with our son and the neighbors.
One weird part too is when you finally start to cut the yarn the instructions indicate something like "you might find the yarn falls to the middle when you are cutting...don't worry! it won't fall out" when in fact OH HECK YEAH its gonna fall out...unless you position your other hand to hold the middle of the donut appliance firmly to hold the shreds in place.  Not a step for young ones for sure.

The only problem with Kingsburg is the way the battles are handled. The king's aid is a die roll. This eliminates so much strategy that it renders this aspect of the game meaningless. The expansion solves this problem luckily.
If you are an avid fan and have a solid knowledge of the series, you will love it. For the rest of us, it can be quite confusing. But, my son is happy. My husband enjoys it, and my two younger children (ages 10 1/2 and 12) are able to play along with a little help.
3955	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	this miniature is a beautiful sculpt.  it comes with additional cards and pieces that also serve as a nice expansion to the core X-wing set.  this ship is bigger than the others and has a rear firing arc, so it really mixes things up.

I'm always up for a game of Taboo.  It's different every time you play it because the same people never get the same words twice.  Get it today and start enjoying.
The pages are glossy, as I said, with full color illustrations derived (I think) from the graphic novels. Each page is colored and decorated as though it were part of a spiral-bound magical notebook, and the text is littered with post-its, blue highlighter and marginalia purportedly between the collaborators of the design team.
8523	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Got this game for my 6-year-old. I think it will be fun in another year or so. The rules are kind of hard to explain.
We go back and forth on the games we'll play.  I'm into strategy and spatial games:  days of wonder games, carcassonne, blokus, that sort of thing.  He likes storied RPGs.  I *really* don't like the Mars Attacks! and Last NIght on Earth games, but the birthday lad sure does.
4087	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	A great addition to the base game. Like everything else in this line, all the components are high quality. This is easily one of the better lines of miniatures.

3513	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	i've played dungeons and dragons 4e for a good year now and my friends and i are taking a break from our campaign. one of my players told me that we should try pathfinder, and i told him how i've been interested in trying it out too. since D&D is going through a beta playtest for its new edition i figure why not? i saw this box at my local hobby store so i bought it. here's what you get, a pack of die (d4,d6,d8,2d10 one with tenths the other in one values, d12, and a d20), a nice little sheet telling you want to do if you want to be a player or a Dm or GM (i prefer DM), which you get 2 books a GM guide and a Player's guide, 4 pre made characters and 4 blanket character sheets. now! this is where it loses a star because after we played a quick session with the module adventure inside we like the system and since we have some experience with table top RPG in general we have not played 3.5e of D&D which this is based from. that's not a bad thing, but my main beef is the character creation and character sheets. after this box i bought the core rulebook, bestiary, and game mastery guide. in the core rulebook the character sheet towards the back is WAY different than the beginner's character sheet. in the beginner's character sheet its conveniently made in an order which is easy and effective and not too much of a hassle. in the core rulebook you have different organization problems also new terms which the beginner's box left out are the CMB (Combat Maneuver Bonus) and CMD (Combat Maneuver Defense). i know they're different its a reason its called the beginner's box, but i feel it should still cover those terms especially since i'm not familiar with that kind of bonus and defense.
9019	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I was very disappointed with this toy.  When it was put in the tub the dolphins do not make sounds like they are suppose to.  The floats do not stay together and this makes my 20 mos. old very upset.  They look good and are cute but not worth the money.  Would not recommend.
Party management is really just a game of attrition. Any one character in your party (that you rolled at the start of your turn) can kill any one creature or open a treasure chest. However, this action 'uses up' your party member, and they then go to your graveyard. You only started with seven at most, so while the first or second level of the dungeon is a breeze, making it to that eighth or ninth level can be quite a challenge. However, each class has a sort of 'sweep' ability. Mages can kill one skeleton or open one chest, but they can kill up to three slimes. A rogue can only kill one of any type of creature, but they can open up multiple treasure chests before bowing out.

The Living Card Game (LCG) concept takes a lot of the headaches out of this style of game which has otherwise limited good designed older games from seeing the play it deserves.  Essentially, LCG's give you everything you need to play and keep the pool of cards limited to whatever the buyer is happy with playing.  Compared the CCG's which function on rarities like a pack of baseball cards, it takes alot of resources to get a finely tuned set of cards to play the exact way you want.

We released the butterflies within a few hours of hatching.
6406	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My kids grew up with this game and we still play it now and then as adults.  It's a simple game that both adults and kids can enjoy and lay with one another without the adults having any big advantage -- they may or may not use better strategy! It's simple to learn too, so anyone can join in and play competently by the second round.

6080	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a pretty fun group game, but can drag a bit with multiple players. This is because people want to calculate their moves on the board before committing to the best possible route.  A fun variation we like to play is that when you start your turn, you declare your gear and then roll.  Once you roll, you 'drive' the car the necessary moves.  No take backs, no do overs.  This encourages players to pay attention to their car when it is not their turn, and also adds and element of hazard that would be present in a real driving\racing situation.  Makes a good party game, but you may want to limit games to one lap per game.
My question is when I try to  play on my Fire tablet, I cannot "choose cards". The instructions has no reference to drawing your cards. I've tried tapping twice; touching and holding, with no luck. If anyone has a suggestion, please advise.

7228	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I've been playing this game with my 2 and 4 year old kids.  They both really like it, and grasped the concept quickly.  I adapted the game for younger players by leaving out the muncher cards. Also we say the name of each card out loud as we lay it down so that I can use my voice inflection to cue them that it is time to slap (...tomato...hot dog...bacon...Bacon!)  My 2 year old loves to slap the sandwich thieves and say, "stop thief!"  She is too young to recognize the sandwich patterns to slap, but still has a lot of fun playing.  My 4 year old, after playing a few times, has learned to slap the doubles (2 of the same cards in a row) and is just starting to recognize the sandwiches (3 cards: 2 of the same with something different in the middle).  He has also become quicker at recognizing and slapping so that he can do it first.

Once you unpack everything, the first thing you are likely to do (after marveling at the rather cool-looking dice) is want to read the instruction manual. That can make for a slightly strained initial impression, because the instructions are somewhat poorly laid out and worded. The booklet is small, which makes sense since they want it to fit in the chest, but I wonder if it might not make sense to have it on an unfolding 'map' type of sheet. This would have given more room to include examples on how the turns might go (a common item in tabletop rulebooks) as well as giving you more information at a glance (as opposed to having to hunt from one page to another in case you sort-of-maybe-kind-of-recall seeing something relevant two pages prior). The rules are just vague enough that the first game is a slow, almost awkward affair. I recall reading it and noting that some people online saying it is just easier to watch YouTube videos of the play, which is anything but a ringing endorsement for the rule clarity.

873	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	The perfect game. The board and pieces are visually attractive and it requires a good dose of strategy without becoming overwhelming, it is in fact quite easy for new players to pick it up. No dice roll (great!), it is fun as you play and a match takes around 60 min... Typically everyone feels it has a chance to win until the end, so it is quite engaging all the way. It does not create direct conflict among players so it is great option for families and close friends, nobody will start arguing in the middle of the match (unless you forget to take your meds). It is best played with 4 players. It is fine but crowded with 5 people, it is fine but not as exciting with 3, and it is ok with 2. Recommended!

Is it all worth it? I think so. I'm certainly still running a game twice a month for a keen group, though three months and six sessions in we're still having problems with the mechanics because they are so different to our gaming community's other RPGs. I think the payoff will be worth it. I hope so.
Finally, I want to finish my review by saying that this product is still provably the best way to learn how to play a (great but fairly complex) RPG in a very approachable way.  Literally, the only thing you need is few zipper plastic bags (to store your tokens and dices) and a non-permanent marker.  Yet, with only a level 1 adventure included, I feel that for some of us the potential to utilize these amazing resources are wasted, if you lack an experienced person who can guide the rest us, who aren't very knowledgeable at the game.

It's one of those games the family can play together without getting bored. It's so variable each time you play is so different. The best part is cleaning up and putting them back in the box in a certain order. This is great for kids to learn how to do a matrix. Cleaning up is my daughters favorite part. The game itself is really high quality. The tiles are thick wood and it comes with a sturdy bag. The box is pretty heavy duty. The instructions are very straight forward

Also included in this expansion is a new X-Wing fighter with a (slightly) new paint scheme.

"Battleship" has a lot to do with strategy and luck.  You have to strategically place your pieces on the grid so they won't get "hit" and you have to use that and a little bit of luck to do your darndest to sink your opponent's ships.  It can get pretty tense when both players only have one ship left, and one wrong move (or right move depending upon your situation) can end the game.

And thats it for the downsides.  On to all the good stuff.  The theme is spot on.  Cyberpunk future awaits you and immerses you as well!  You will really feel like a powerful mega corp using any means necessary to achieve your goals.  And on the flip side you feel like a hacker messing with the corporate structure in every way you can.  The art is well done and FFG was generous with the huge amount of tokens you get in the set.  Add to that the gameplay as well.  The game is very well designed and flows quickly and steadily along.  Even though the game takes a while to play, you don't even realize it because it feels almost breakneck speed sometimes.
Instructions- The rules are simple, and they read quickly.  However they are a bit cramped and a few of the leads get buried.  On my first game, we made two fatal flaws: we multiplied the goods sold by the price and we didn't use the center, uncontrolled buildings.  If you dig deeper into the rules, those are central to the game.  I'd like the rules to be a bit expanded and to provide a few more examples.  As it stands the rules are ok if you take the time to really read them, but you can't just bust this game out and play in four minutes. 4.25/5

The game comes with a family, or basic, version of the rules and then a set of advanced rules. The basic rules are great for playing with younger kids, but the advanced rules are best for older kids and adults.

So my experience was more good than bad.  First the good.  I love the variable factions, technology tree, component variety, modular map setup, and different paths to victory.  All of this makes for a varied, very replayable game with lots of interesting choices and branching decision trees.  The social interaction is a huge boon as well, I love negotiating, scheming, threatening, and pleading with my opponents across the table.  It's also quite thematic as each faction has certain specialties and you really feel yourself improving over time as you build more advanced buildings and gain new technology and abilities.

This newer addition has added Gadgets and a few other new cards to mix up the game. It's easily a family game, but not for kids under 6 I would guess as the rules can be pretty complicated.

However, we were gifted the game when we first moved out of state by my family.
The game continues back and forth until one player finishes building their 4th building.  The other players get one last turn before the end of the game.  Scoring then takes place by totaling up the victory points of each player's buildings adding any bonuses from special abilities.  The player with the most points is the winner.

5969	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Intersting idea
2040	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I was so nervous to try this out.  I didn't want to blow Christmas/Santa for my 6 year old.  I worried that he might not buy into it, and therefore might not buy into Santa anymore either (he might start questioning it all).  I think it's incredibly important how you introduce this, so make sure you put a lot of thought into it.  I decided to create a letter from Santa & snuck it into our mailbox (and had my 6 year old get the mail that day).  Santa told them (6 & 3 year old boy) that because there are so many children in the world for him to watch over, he's decided to send one of his elves to watch over our family.  I think it's incredibly important to immediately address WHY you're getting an elf right now (when you didn't before) and why YOUR house is getting one, when not everyone's house has one (I was worried about kids at school).  Santa's letter announced that the elf would be arriving that night, so to watch for him in the morning.  The next morning the elf showed up sitting up in the Christmas tree, with the book about him underneath the tree, and a handwritten letter (Mom's left-handed writing). It was a flawless entrance, and my 6 year old believes it all even MORE than my 3 year old!  He was instantly writing letters back to Santa, asking our elf to take it back to Santa that night, etc.  The rest of the month was SO fun, not only for the magic in my kids faces each morning, but for the fun my husband and I had each evening getting the elf set up in new fun ways.  Make sure you have a plan in place for if they touch him (there need to be consequences or they won't believe he's magical), and make sure to set a daily reminder on your cell phone (I did 10pm).  You don't want to blow it by not having moved him one day.  They almost cried the day he had to say goodbye!  On the last day he was holding baby Jesus from our nativity, leaving a note to remember that while Santa & presents are fun, remember that Jesus is the real meaning of Christmas (we're quite religious normally, so I had to tie it in somehow, without being the lame family that doesn't allow Santa stuff at all).  ;)  Definitely recommend!!!
Christopher's head, scarf, mittens, and shoes are all cheap plastic that has been painted and he looks cheaper than I expected.  I was hoping that he would be very well made so that he could be passed down thru the generations.

My oldest loves this elf because he makes messes, sends and receives mail from other elves, leaves treats, and plays tricks. It's just silly fun!
If you want to learn how to play this game, I suggest you watch the YouTube training videos available online to learn the basic rules, because trying to figure out how to play based on the rules is going to be a lot more work. Even when you learn the rules, the rules CHANGE depending on what cards you are using because the cards override the basic rules every time, and the text on the cards is never explanation enough. Be prepared to have your Smartphone set to Google and to use it often for individual card rule clarifications. And if you ever hit an impasse on individual rules, you should always have one player designated the gamemaster, and be ready to move ahead with a reasonable compromise to keep the game from bogging down. Add to that the fact that this game is asymmetrical (the two sides play completely differently), and I wouldn't blame people for being intimidated. Heck, I've played countless matches and sometimes I didn't understand MAJOR rules regarding links and traces and reoccurring credits, etc. In that way, this game is a bit like Sentinels of the Multiverse, because like that game, you can still play and enjoy it while not completely understanding how to play. Unlike that game, the instructions are very well written, and things are always moving quickly. It's also a lot more fun for two players who can appreciate this sort of thing.

My 1st grade daughter is really getting a lot out of it though.  Following the track to 100 is much easier for her and slightly educational as well. It's fun to play together, but Mom has to be there with the kids to help.  Since I purchased the game to have something fun to do as a family, I have no problem sitting there showing my son how to count and where to put his game piece.  If you want something for your pre-school age child to do independantly, then look elsewhere.

Each player is dealt three destination cards in the beginning and must keep at least two. These form the basis for their lines. They also receive four train cards. To claim a line, players must create sets of the same color and number of train cards as the line connecting two cities. (The color of the lines has nothing to do with the player's train color, but the cards they have in hand.)

In some respects, the game feels very similar to "Race for the Galaxy," but "Eminent Domain" is much simpler to learn and perhaps more fun to play.  Player's attempt to colonize words, or take them over via military conquest (small plastic spaceships act as military currency in the game), research technology (which gives players access to more kinds of cards), search for new worlds to bring into their empire, and produce or trade goods for victory points.  There is a lot going on here but not so much that you feel overwhelmed.  Also, with its 45 minute- 1 hour playing time the game will end before it starts feeling repetitive.  Like "Race for the Galaxy," it does very much feel like each player is engaged in a solitaire game of building up their own unique star empire and trying to get the most points before anyone else.  With the "roles," however, there is more player interaction.  What you choose to do on your turn will effect other players most of the time.  This helps to keep players engaged throughout.
5904	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This a great filler game. We bring this out while waiting for the others to show up. Its fast and fun to play. While it is described as a 4 player game - you could potentially play with a couple more players, but it really drags the game down. 4 seems to be a the sweet spot.

She loved getting one of my favorite childhood books along with the doll and animals to make it even more fun.  A unique gift that no one else thought of.  The packaging it came in could have been a little nicer since I was giving it as a gift, but it wasn't that big of a concern.
The lid didn't line up. But I made it work.

9848	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	These are really cute and I love the education concept, however they are a little hard to open. I have a four year old and one year old and they are always coming to me for help  "Mommy help. Open these."

3337	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Definitely my favorite board game. And the second edition merges in all the good stuff from the original expansion while adding a couple new improvements that only benefit an already ideal game!
So there you have it.  I will acknowledge all games have pros and cons.  But you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least try this game out.  All the best and may the Force....ah you get the idea.  Happy gaming!  :)
6964	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	What I like about this game is that it's got the same kind of strategy and logical thinking that chess takes, but adds an unpredictable dimension by allowing the players to set up their pieces differently at the start of each game with the rank of pieces hidden from the opponent.
I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.
223	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Wrath of Ashardalon is a fun game.  If you like dungeon style board games that use cooperative play mechanics, then you'll really enjoy this.
The buttons barely work. You have to hit them firmly and check the display to make certain that your button hit was seen before moving on to the next number you want to enter. This is annoying for an adult but nearly impossible for a very young child to remember or accept. I also figured it was a matter of days before some of the buttons stopped working entirely.
5358	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	It's deceptively simple at first glance. The second time you play it you start to realize how strategic it can be.

1405	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We love this game too. The replay on it is high and the strategy is easy once you play a couple times. I just wish this version had more routes. We have bought India and Switzerland s an expansion, but holding off on buying TTR Europe because I cannot justify spending so much on yet another version that is almost exactly the same s this one.
4003	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Lol. They're dice that you can only use for the FF  Star Wars RPG.  What else is there to say?
2. There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it, so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily.
Highly recommended for almost any age and number to play a variety of things.
The game is hard, but it's fun for them, and I play it too. I  really liked the books, and I'd think I'd have an advantage, but I don't seem to, as I never win. There's a lot about character names.  I'm bad with names.  The puzzles include putting the scenes in order. I really like those.

9490	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived.  Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews.  Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things.  My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love.  So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!

5762	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	These cards are a great thickness to work with, and the curved edge makes it easy to take one off the stack.  The topics included are nicely comprehensive (colors, body parts, shapes, etc).  My kids will do one "section" of vocab at a time and I can quiz them.  I am going to look for another set of flash cards that have Spanish on one side and English on the other to add to our collection.  This set has the same Spanish word on both sides with one picture of the word on the back (just like the box pictures).  We can't use them for quizzing ourselves back and forth for learning vocabulary, but they are good words to learn with a nice, easy read font.
From a fiscal spending standpoint, the game is much cheaper to get into as well with a predetermined set of cards released and no randomization in the setup of this core set as well as future expansions to come.  No having to buy rares here to beef up your deck here, its a level playing field.
The set has typical great Fantasy Flight quality, excellent artwork, and high quality construction.

5257	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Fun game for the whole family. The only thing I don't like about this game is the extensive recording of points on paper. I feel like this aspect could have been better integrated in the game itself. It's really annoying to constantly keep track of score on a piece of paper after each person plays tiles. Otherwise a good and fun game!
4601	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn, this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.
Enlarged player sheets - The original sheets had 20 buildings, these contain an extra two rows, so they have 28 buildings.  The bottom line is that instead of only having 5 possible buildings to choose to build, there are now 7 possibilities.  That's a big step in the right direction.

Less complicated than Risk and more complex than Clue, which makes it perfect for our family.

I have to say, while the dynamic is fun, Plundering (the ability to steal one item per turn, created by a rule) has to be one of the most frustrating parts of the game.

  But please, I love Amazon, but their Days of Wonder games are all overpriced.  You can get this and their other games much cheaper on designated game sites.  Do a search, read other reviews, boardgamegeek is a wonderful place to look and compare games.  This was one of the first games I bought and I just keep finding more neat games to buy that you can't find here.
This is really one of those gifts that surprised me in terms of how much the kids love it and also how well it was priced and put together. Also, the paint cleans up really easy from your face and any towels or shirts that get on it. White shirts are doomed but other items like towels or clothes, the paint will come right off or out in the wash.
At first I was worried about whether such a thin (i.e. not well insulated) cable would pick up transient noise, but this cable performs much better than the standard cable.  I highly recommend this cable.  However, please note that if you run this across your floor, the thinness and lightweight nature of the cable might cause it to get tangled up in your vacuum cleaner.

but over all well worth the price.
I think they could have created better game pieces, but the Fate cards are fun and the questions and activities diverse.

I liked this game because it's true to the MP movies and makes you remember lines from the movies and quoting them and even some singing. The singing was a bit silly, but it's only on one or two cards and hey it's fun! Re play is high as well.
6423	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My family plays this at least once a week, and we all still love each other, so there you go!!  Great classic game :-)

I do agree that the artwork stinks! I also think the big headed kids aren't great. I have 2 older boards (one from the early 70's and the other from mid 70's) and my son does prefer playing on those. The pictures are much more straight forward and easier to understand.
Finally, if you have never played a table-top RPG before, and this is your planned entree, then I highly recommend that you find some experienced players to help step you through the process.  This is not Risk or Monopoly, and you will get out of the game what you invest in it in terms of time and attention.

3403	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a great kit! The face paint is excellent quality.  Colors are vibrant, go on easily with good coverage, and don't irritate the skin at all (at least in our experience).  The paint did not smudge once it was dry and it was easy to work with.  It removed fairly easily with a make up removal cloth followed by a warm wet washcloth.  I like the ideas in the book, and especially the party cards.  I'm excited to use those for a little carnival I'm helping with.  They look cute, but not overly complicated.  The instructions look easy to follow.  All of the designs look great, however I have found that some better options can be found in various places online.  For example, for a tiger I have found much better designs elsewhere.  As a quick resource to do a nice job while under time constraints I think it is awesome though.  I recommend getting some make up sponge wedges to help apply larger amounts of make up at a time.

This was our family's second Scene It game--the other being a Disney game--and while the gameplay was exactly the same, the menus, music, and voice-over were much more mellow, subdued, and ultimately more enjoyable and relaxing.  Although not introduced, I am pretty sure that the game's narrator is supposed to be the character of Carlisle, though clearly it's not the actor providing the voice.
If you are new to the Dungeon Command game, this is a very fun strategy board game / Trading card game hybrid where you essentially battle your army versus your opponents creatures until one warband proves victorious.  You draw cards in to your hand during your turn to bolster your creatures basic attacks/abilities.  The game takes about 2-3 minutes to set up, once you know how to play and a match can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on how serious you get (kind of like chess.)  One of the best things about Dungeon Command is that you can easily put it away/set it back up if you need to take a break in the middle of a game.  My boyfriend and I usually play an entire match in two sittings during the weekdays.  If you are in to the D&D world and/or role-playing, you can definitely add as much RP and dialogue as you'd like.  If RPing isn't your thing, don't worry-- there's no dice rolling or paper and pencil requirement for Dungeon  Command, just lay out the board, draw your hand and you're ready to play!

Cons: if you are traveling in a small town or out in the country, or even simply drive under some tall trees, it may make it act a little funny at times.

The oldest is 16, the youngest is 4(yes, she's caught on enough to be able to compete). Amazingly, we ALL enjoy playing this game. Not like Candyland, or other kids' games where adults feel tortured. This game is actually fun for the older kids and adults too! It's got a bit of luck involved, which allows all ages the opportunity to win. But it certainly isn't all luck. You need a good memory as well. The game is different than any card game I've ever played. If you're not sure, I'd suggest getting it... you will enjoy! Just make sure you play it a couple/few times before you decide if you like it or not.

The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.

5157	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love board games. Qwirkle is sort of a mix between dominoes, scrabble, othello, and any number of match-up games (think uno). What's great about it is that even with deceptively simple looks (match colors or shapes, 6 of each), the game gets really complex, really fast. Playing with a group is a lot of fun, because even when you have good moves, you're not trying to give away the elusive Qwirkle (a line of 6), worth 12 points. It's a great family game because of the relatively simple rules, and scoring isn't too complicated, but you definitely need to bring some addition skills! Overall, a great game to bring out at family gatherings and with friends.

I have a Lincoln Log set when I was a child & incorporated along with other toys while playing which he seems to do on his own. it has a lot of the small log pieces, so I would recommend keeping everything together in the box when playing is finished so that the next time the child wants to play with it, it will all be there!

Even the argument that it is more portable than an actual game of Scrabble doesn't really hold water nowadays.

I recommend this game heartily with reservations if you have the time to scan the cards and remove a few of the less tasteful cards before guests arrive in situations where you think it appropriate to do so.  The beads are pretty, the game play is fast and we all laughed a lot, however, it is just a fun game with no real competition, more just time for laughing and being silly.
Top-notch interactive entertainment for adults and teens.
Add the "Meteor Rocket" to that list.
Fantasy Flight Games has a new product line called Living Card Games, or LCGs. The function of an LCG is simple: to provide a solid game with only the contents of the core set  cards while at the same time giving the player the option of buying more packs of cards to add to the set. These monthly expansions add versatility to your game and the best part is that you know what you're getting before you purchase because the same cards are in every pack. Android Netrunner happens to be the most popular and best LCG to date.
That said, I don't think this is a good game for a casual player. He's offered to teach me, but there are a lot of rules that make it more beneficial to play regularly so you don't forget what you're doing. I prefer a game that's more casual with a small list of rules so I can pick it up to play a couple times a year without feeling like I need to relearn the game every time. I just don't like sitting down to the same game every week and I don't have a group I can play with weekly. We're parents and I'm a stay at home mom so I've got limited time and we don't play board games when the kids (toddlers) are up because we don't want pieces getting lost/rearranged/etc. When he first started playing it, I recall him mentioning how hard it was to learn and he was interested, but seemed to find the number of rules pretty daunting. Maybe once the kids are old enough to participate (or at least keep their hands off), I'll try to join in. If so, I'll update with my impressions of game play.

I enjoy playing as well.  I always like a game I can play with my young children that I really enjoy too.  She has to pay attention and remember what cards she has so she really focuses on the game when we are playing.  I think that is my favorite part.  She is learing to really focus plus she's working with simple adding of numbers.  This was a great choice to purchase.  I may pick up a few extra packs as gifts.  Not a bad gift at all for $10.

Each player starts with 3 cards during the first round and the number of cards dealt increases by one in subsequent rounds.  The game seems to become more challenging in later rounds when you have more cards in your hands and are trying to create words and "go out".  Enjoyable with two or more players!
I don't love it though, a big part of it being, as I said, the  dice combat system used for the gladiator fights.  The other reasons I didn't exactly enjoy my first game can easily be avoided though.  For one, despite what the game suggests, I don't recommend playing the "quick game" that has players start at 7 honor.  At that level most of the intrigue cards can already be played and all of them can be played with the support of just one house.  This makes it a lot less interesting when you can play every card out of the gate.  I recommend setting aside enough time to play the normal or even the "long game".
In the case of Battlestar Galctica board game, thing are working, but beware: the combinations available to play the game, when you have the three sets at your table, are becoming out of hand. Initial loyalty set-up card is definitely a situation, you must read the rules carefully. The situation is so bad, that the rule book added a "Frequented overlooked rules" section.
4.5 of 5 UPDATE (5 of 5) All game components are well made besides one exception. The ship's, nodes and weapon/shield markers are a good quality plastic resin with no noticeable imperfections. The cardboard cutout parts and system discs are well designed and cut with the exception on a few warp tokens. For whatever reason, some of the warp tokens labels are lifting up (it was not done in the removal process). All cards are printed neatly and are well designed. Ordering on the day of release (October 30th, 2016) the Promo Exploration cards were included!!! The rulebook is a good size and organized well.

My only complaint is that the calculator and the register don't seem to have any logic in common - it's just a calculator.  It would be nice if the screen would interact with the register, such as saying 'approved' when the credit card is used, or 'thank you' when you open the drawer, or if it had a bit of register logic, like making change - although you can mock that last one up with the calculator pretty easily.

Some are reprints of previous dungeon tiles but no matter, this is meant to be a core-set. If you are new to D&D 4 then you should pick this up, it has enough tiles for a modest sized dungeon crawl game. I'll probably pick up a second box set to expand my tile sets. What is excellent about this set is that the box itself is a large sized dungeon room (both lid and box). While I still use a battlemat this is great for adding more atmosphere for specific dungeon encounters. Wizards D&D are really putting out good quality products with this Essentials line. While touted for D&D this set could easily be used for other fantasy RPG games like Warhammer or Pathfinder too.

(1) Simple enough for my 3.5 year old to comprehend after just a brief explanation and our first game.  The objective of the game is to be the first to reach square #100, using a spinner numbered 1 through 6, which advances you on the board.  He is learning his numbers, so seeing each square numbered from 1-100 allows us to count together and learn our numbers while each one of us advances on the board.
The board game is an amazing translation of the original computer game. The added nuance of dividing the resource management challenge across the different roles was a great idea and it forces players to communicate more openly all with the added pressure of the companion app counting down per action step. And it's hard to think about the team budget as the Commander when you see everyone allocating resources as they see fit since pretty much every piece on the board costs money. A scientist can quickly drain your funds early in the round just be maxing out all research projects, thus leaving you with insufficient funds for troops to send on the mission or satellites to place in orbit.

I suggest Hasbro refresh this game, with larger spaces and bigger numbers.
The rulebook for this game is a small multi-folded glossy sheet of paper.  It fits nice and neatly inside the smaller box.  There are lots of great pictures as well as examples throughout.  Everything is explained really well including a breakdown of the different aspects of the cards and game boards.  There are also rules included for adding either the bonus point cards or the Inland Traders expansion as well.  It's fairly short and to the point.  There's nothing difficult to understand at all.  It looks really good and is well written.  What more can you ask for?

With these I reckon I've hit some sort of sweet spot. The pip printing looks like it was done on a low-budget press (but wasn't), the court cards have a one-way up, crowded artwork feel. None of the cards has an index in the corner, and those corners are square rather than rounded. The backs are also very olde-worlde in look. 10/10.

The game is incredibly well-designed, the board is beautiful, and you can play with up to ten players, though the game is really fun with only two (which really surprised me). There is a large amount of risk/reward going on which separates this from a mere dice-rolling game, and if it's too easy you can apply a ton of extra rules to make the game more complex (pit-stops, weather, driver powers, individual damage meters for car parts).
5435	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Yes, this is a product that will only appeal to Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series.  Should this be a deterrent to buying this game?  No, of course not!  There are a lot of different Scene it? games out there geared towards different subject matters so there are plenty of options that will appeal to most.  This version will be loved by all of those who love the movies and the books alike.  There were plenty of options and so much to do that it could be played many times without worry of repetition. This would be fabulous for a slumber party, no doubt about it!  If you're looking for a gift for your loved one who also happens to be a fan of the series, this will make a great one!
Players acquire resources during the productive seasons (spring, summer and fall). There are 8 phases in the game of which 3 are productive seasons. Players roll three dice (6-sided dice). Players play one or more dice onto the game board. The game board has 18 spaces numbered from 1 to 18--representing all the advisors from the Jester (1) to the King (18). To influence an advisor (and receive the bonus thereto), a player must place dice with the correct total onto that advisor's space. Thus, to influence the Jester, a player must place a die with a "1" onto that space. If you didn't roll a "1", you cannot influence the Jester. Players can place multiple dice onto an advisor in order to influence the more powerful advisors; again the total of the dice must equal the advisor's value.
Your kid doesn't care about aesthetics, or nostalgia, or strategy... your child just wants to spend time with YOU, laughing, having fun.  So get into it.  Get really excited when you get the chocolate card, and get really silly when you get the cupcake and have to slide all the way back to the beginning.  Be kind and firm about taking turns and following the rules, and enjoy every second of it.  Give personas to the gingerbread men and make funny voices for each of them.  Have fun and so will your child, and you'll actually be excited when he brings it out AGAIN...  These are the days you'll wish you could get back, and if your kid isn't enjoying playing this game, maybe he needs a nap or a snack, or maybe he isn't enjoying it because you're not enjoying it.  It is astounding what a kid is capable when a kid is happy.
 Game Play
*I was given this product in exchange for an honest review*
Now I haven't actually tried to get my kids to play this with their friends, in part because we've lost the game board, but overall, this is an excellent game for bringing families closer and sharing family stories and history.

3) For advanced players, there is plenty of strategizing and foiling of others plans to go around.  Even though it's easy to learn and entertaining for young beginners, this is still fun for highly educated, highly competitive adults.
9242	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	exactly what I was looking for.
6530	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Flimsy game, with an unprotected cardboard top that easily tears and wrinkles.  The old game was much more durable, though my kids liked some of the new twists in this version.
They stamp well on a variety of surfaces (I used them on material, canvas, and paper) and they clean up nicely too.
6619	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I played Trouble when I was little and I bought some for my classroom.  Love the game and the competition and strategy.
8033	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My son loves it.  Every time it's in the playroom, he plays with it.  It has a card (any thing that size works) and it makes a beep when swiped.  It comes with money, too.  The buttons work as a calculator, and it dings when the drawer opens.  The battery lasted about a year, and it's easy to replace.  Like it better than other registers I looked at.
3963	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was a gift and was on my son's wish list so he was very happy to receive it.
2677	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I'm so glad I picked these up. I like that they are easy to find and use (how many times do you get stamps that are all bunched together in box and you have to dump them all out in order to find the one you want? You don't have to do that with these because they're all layered nicely in this tin.)
9894	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Great
6664	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	fun game for kids that like puzzles/legos/that kind of thing.

Completing 5 and 6 train routes usually ends up being the best strategy in this version.  I would rather route completion being most important.  Another thing that can be fixed with expansions or other versions though.
4730	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is an awesome and inexpensive way for kids to see how the human body is put together and how all the parts work. I highly recommend it!
4589	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Bananagrams is like Speed Scrabble, just without the points counting. It was a hit over the holidays with family members of all different ages.
845	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Pretty complicated for 8 year olds.  I'd raise the min age to 9 or 10.
6531	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	All of the pieces do not fit in the container.
857	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My wife and I love this game. The fact that we can play it with just the two of us, or with company is a big plus. Have never been bored playing and once we start it usually consumes the rest of our night.
6721	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Our whole family LOVES his game!! HOURS of brain building fun!
7563	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	It's the standard candyland game.  Not sure there is much else to know about this.


6988	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Realistic and cute looking register with tone and money. Kids will love it.

No one wanted to go through the trouble of figuring it out. Our group regularly plays popular "new" boardgames... with lengthy rules but this was tooo much.
4059	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Thanks
7553	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Very fun to play. My son and nephew love this board game. I have a blast playing against them as well, and I'm 28.
2882	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We have so much fun with Llama Llama...we read the books with the plush and change the clothes, pretend to brush teeth...etc. There are great messages in the books and easy to read/follow for the kiddos.
