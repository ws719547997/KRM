But, it could not be located here in the US and we often ran out of the supply hauled back from France.. Now, with a touch of this added (to a little cream and a little....) to a seared steak, a roasting chicken bathed in it and perhaps a dab to scrambled eggs and....  I attain, at last, the accolades due my legacy.  A delightful mustard flavor and only a little of the heat of others that often masks the flavor of the main star of the dish.  Thank you Amazon....for listing it!  Also to Lynne Rosetto Kasper for reminding me of it and letting me know where to find it...

1036	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'm sure all of you have your own way of doing this. Myself, I prefer to get the leanest meat possible. Have used London broils, trimmed out all the tendons and fat and I do a double grind in my meat grinder. It's difficult to season the meat thoroughly and evenly, but the 2nd grind eliminates that for me. After the 1st grind, season the meat evenly, 1 lb at a time. Then run thru the grinder a 2nd time, which really mixes it up. Using the jerky gun, it spits out evenly the double ground meat and it dries very well.  I've never noticed one piece of meat having more flavor than another, thus eliminating under / over cures.  I hope this helps anyone trying for the 1st time.  Seasoning nonground strips of meat and drying is doable, but the meat will always be tough to chew and hard on ones teeth, perhaps even damaging is you pull too hard to tear off a piece to chew.  Being skeptic,  I used the jerky gun and much to my surprise the strips are very tender (thanks to the grinding) and safe for all ages and no damage to your teeth, false or real.  Once dried to your satisfaction, I bag mine in my foodsaver to keep out moisture and extend it's shelf life.
I have tasted processed honey, and the taste was good.  When I used to think of raw honey, I imagined unfiltered honey with bee parts in it.  Thats the only thing that kept me from trying it "in the raw". I put on my big boy britches, and when my honey arrived ( very well packaged)  I tasted only the top layer which was a light white layer of what I assume was separation due to the cooler temperatures.

So he opened another of the 3 bottles and was WOWED by the flavor.  Dave's is hotter, but the flavor just isn't there.  So if you just want HOT, go for this one.  If you want both, look further.

Great product.  One thing I learned is if it is raw it can always be crystalized into a paste unless the honey comes from the orange blossom which doesn't crystalize but with that as the only exception if it says raw it either comes hard, as a paste or can be manipulated so it will be a full liquid or pasty consistency and once you reach the sweet spot as long as you don't tamper with it anymore and leave it on the shelf in room temperature you will not find that honey transforming consistencies any further.  Once I figured this hard lesson out I was good to go.

I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor, no other fruit juices or artificial flavors mixed in to save money. As a result the cherry really does taste like cherry rather than a syrupy mess that has a hint of cherry. It has an authentic tart cherry mixed in the sweet, and you can taste the tart in the aftertaste. It even has a nice texture in the mouth. I know this sounds gushy but you have to try it!

The Lee family literally invented oyster sauce. Grandpa Lee was making oyster soup and accidentally cooked it down to a thick liquid and that's how it was invented (its main ingredient is concentrated slow cooked oysters). Oyster sauce is a must-have condiment for cooking nearly every one of today's Chinese & Cantonese food dishes (that have sauce) and for a good reason. It imparts a unique flavor that can't be imitated by any other flavoring or condiment. Not sure what they used before this was invented more than 120 years ago, but we're sure glad they use it now.

My gripe however is the lack of strings.  The box claims they save 3.5 million pounds(!?) of landfill waste every year by not using individual wrappers or strings/tags/staples.  That seems like an exaggerated claim, and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book.  It means I always should use/carry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping, and remove them from the hot tea.  It's so annoying I even considered only 3 stars.  Mostly I drink tea at the office, and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd, so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers, which also is odd.  Individual wrappers I can do without because I drink frequently enough the tea doesn't go stale, but please give me strings and staples.

I found this to be a very good extract.  I've only used it in coconut macaroons, with this extract - just a half teaspoon - vanilla extract, and salt being the only flavors added (to the sugar, shredded coconut, egg whites and a bit of flour), and it made for very tasty macaroons.  Nothing overpowering to the flavor, just enough to contribute nicely to the overall taste, blending nicely with the coconut and vanilla.  Glass bottle, not plastic, and I always appreciate organic when it's available.  Not a lot more to say, but I can certainly recommend this product.

The third time last year, and now this year: not so much. About half of the cookies are broken and there is almost no powdered sugar at all: just two tins full of broken brown lumps.

4387	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Like the almond extract that I recently reviewed, the Vanilla Extract by Nielsen-Massey,  does not disappoint.  It's potent, delicious and adds that little something special to my raw fruit and nut balls and bars, as well as my raw smoothies, raw soups and other raw delectable dishes.  Beware if you do not consume alcohol, as this one contains 35% alcohol.  But as stated in my review for the almond extract (which is 90% alcohol), as a non drinker and eating 75% raw foods, I don't mind adding a tiny bit of extract to my recipes.  As well, this extract is kosher, gluten free, allergen free and GMO free.  So why only 4 stars if it is so wonderful?  Well, they added sugar to this extract--an ingredient that is so not necessary. I am going to have to slow down and pay more attention because I would not have purchased this had I known about the sugar.  I use my vanilla paste now to add to recipes--which is free of sugar. Otherwise, if you do not mind the sugar content, this extract is good.
8429	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This was such a fantastic deal. So my only thing that's not really an issue, just a thing lol, is that it was extra bland. The one I usually buy from my co-op actually tastes salty...maybe they season it? This had none of that which is a good thing. You can truly flavor it the way you would like it to be or whatever you're making without fearing extra salt. I say try it. And this is just too good of a deal to pass up.

I had no room in my suitcase to carry home even one can, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon, so much so that I subscribed so that I'll never run out. Normally, I don't like French Roast coffee, and I wasn't sure at first about what the addition of chicory would do to the flavor. I've always made mild-flavored coffee. I read somewhere that the chicory mellows out the flavor of the French roast coffee. Well, maybe, originally, the chicory was added to stretch the coffee that was available, but it does not add an odd flavor to the coffee and, maybe, it does mellow the dark roast flavor. All I know is that I really love this coffee. A great way to start the day.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I didn't like this at first. It was too hot (I like spice, including food, aromas and perfume. Hot and spicy aren't necessarily the same thing).  It did not taste sweet to me unless I used two tea bags.  Unfortunately this seemed too sweet for me this way and the smell was somewhat annoying.  Meanwhile, I ordered Jasmine tea around the same time which is an EXTREMELY bitter green tea if you steep it too long or with too hot water(found this out the hard way).  Then it hit me. Since I didn't like either of them, why not brew the two together and see what happens.  PERFECT EUREKA!!  They seem to balance and compliment each other.  The combination brew is neither too bitter nor too spicy.  It's delicious together and I feel good after drinking it.  The spices used in the Bengal Spice are all given as balancing to the Khapha dosha, as is Jasmine tea (did not know this when I ordered the teas).  I think I stumbled across something good here. I sweeten the brew with a touch of raw honey.

Vitamin B17 as its nicknamed in raw almonds was used to treat cancer and the FDA then made selling raw almonds illegal in California (largest world producer of almonds), except for a few loop holes, so now almonds are usually imported from Spain or Italy.

If you've only been using table salt you need to open your eyes to the wide variety of salts in the world. Fleur de sel makes a great topping to add to any prepared meal. Since you don't need too much, this canister should last some time. Recommended.
1131	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is some great seasoning, but if you use the full pack of cure salt per pound, it is VERY salty. For me, it was just barely edible. I read some other reviewers saying that they only use 1/2 a pack of cure per pound and I'm going to try that on the next batch. I keep my jerky in the fridge and it's usually gone within a couple weeks, so the reduced cure salt shouldn't affect preservation.

- If you want a minty tea, brew it at a lower temperature (steam coming up from the pot but not bubbling yet) for only 2-3 minutes. Cold brewing also produces a tea that is light on the green tea aspect but very minty.
1100	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite flavor and is what everyone is used to. Have tried other brands when I could not find this in the store and regret it. It is a mild flavor and is good to use when making jerky or sticks. All NESCO flavors are great, as family likes the Teriyaki flavor. For best results would recommend letting set overnight after mixing, covering with plastic wrap in refrigerator. Would also recommend using beef at least 85% or less. It will come out dry, if you don't. Using the NESCO dehydrator, it runs around 165 degrees. Rotate the trays as the lower trays dry faster, and turn the jerky as it dries. The round NESCO dehydrator is not efficient at making best use of tray space when making straight lengths of jerky, but they now make a new square model, recently purchased, and has adjustable temperatures. Added a small amount of water, makes it mix easier.

Raw honey has not been pasteurized (heat treated) and retains more of the beneficial nutrients and antioxidants. Also, the fact that its in a raw state means that it will include propolis, which has antimicrobial properties and has been used in traditional medicine for treating burns and cuts, cold sores, and for oral health, among other things. It also contains more bee pollen, which is considered by many to be a superfood, but can also promote an allergic response in some people. Ive heard it said that eating local raw honey may help reduce allergies since you are already used to the pollen thats local to you. Because of the (very small) risk that raw honey may contain Clostridium botulinum, its not recommended for infants or pregnant mothers.

Osteoarthritis... Some research shows that taking some turmeric extracts can reduce the pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee. In one study, turmeric worked about as well as ibuprofen for reducing pain.
I vaguely recall the first time I tasted this sauce, putting the end of a toothpick in the thick dark concoction and dabbing it onto my tongue and experiencing a very unpleasant feeling.  That was then.  Now I can easily put a generous drop on each bite of my sandwich or pizza, even with my morning eggs sometimes.  Yes, I am addicted to hot sauce and I will say that I have tried hundreds of different kinds.  This one, in my opinion, is the most flavorful while still delivering a good slap of heat.

9947	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This product has a nice taste and is a good value for the price. I would have given it 5 stars, but in addition to stevia, the product contains xylitol, another natural sweetener. I tend to have digestive reactions to xylitol, but not to this product.

The only drawback with this powder is the inclusion of the nasty, super-processed instant creamer.  They don't put enough of it in the mix to really make the product creamy at all - you have to still mix it with whole milk to really make it into chai.  However, you can still taste the awful artificial stuff.  It would be so nice to get a version without the instant creamer - you could add some milk and this would qualify for being hands-down the best instant chai on the market.

Why pay absurd prices for spices in tiny little plastic jars at the market when you can have a lot around for 1/8th the price per ounce and it is likely much fresher than what makes it to the store.

I made a glass of tea & I tried a tablespoon & I could not tell even that I put it in, then I put in 2nd tablespoon & again nothing, then 3rd & same then fourth & it was the same, the only difference was now my tea was ruined because it was nothing but undissolved date sugar floating in my tea cup & the water was very hot so this stuff should have dissolved, but no not at all. I think this stuff would be good for things like instead of using white powdered sugar, use date sugar because it is not that sweet. It's all good because I also use other healthy sugar alternatives like ( raw organic Agave Nectar, raw organic honey & organic sugar cane sugar. Packaging was not bad, but for the price I did not expect anything special. It is another healthy option, but not for me because I want something that dissolves & something you can actually use in place of sugar & this was not doing it for me. 4 tablespoons & no change just swimming date grounded powder floating in cup.

IMO the green has just the right amount of heat and flavor. The last one is the Chipolte and was not very hot and has a little smokey flavor to it, I found it nice on certain foods you don't want to heat up too much.

This powdered wasabi has fresh flavor and it's an easy way to keep wasabi on hand for getting creative.  How about adding a small amount to a rub for seafood or steak?

Cafe au lait is awesome made with whole milk and sugar, but it's fattening, so I rarely have it.  But that's ok if you like black coffee, which I do.  Then Cafe Du Monde is just the best.  As stated in one of the reviews above, French Market brand doesn't even begin to compare.  The one criticism I have is that Cafe Du Monde isn't available in K-cups.

I usually only like licorice as a hard candy, but I found these shoft chewies very good and with outstanding flavor.  Granted, they were a little on the expensive side, so I will only occasionally treat myself to them.

It's just not like a macaroon- but there is coconut flavor.  The bar has a nice texture- and I certainly love the way no one flavor overpowers the bar.

A natural for beans, of course.  Delicious on chicken...  We were so sorry when we moved on southward and found ourselves outside Valentina territory.  When we came back up through Mexico several years later, we made a point of buying a couple of bottles of Valentina to bring back to the States with us...only to find that it had arrived in California grocery stores while we were away!

What a great ice tea it makes.

This gives the tea a wonderful combined flavor! Serve over ice and add just a small amount of sugar or Splenda to taste. Yummy tea!

I used two (2) tablespoons as the exclusive seasonings in two quarts of ingredients that included home-canned plain tomato sauce, 1.3 pounds of ground round, a can of thoroughly rinsed mild chili beans, and 1/2 cup each of chopped onion, green pepper, and celery.  The addition of the Chili Base took the pot from bland ground beef soup to bright-colored tasty chili that I will be proud to serve to anyone.  This is well worth the investment.  Please note that the suggestions on the jar said use 4 (four) tablespoons of Chili Base in about that amount of chili--half that amount is plenty for my taste, besides making it more cost effective.

Make noises and gestures like the Gourmand Skeksis from "Dark Crystal" in the feast scene. I'm not kidding. It's that good. It's fennel, but you won't taste fennel once it's cooked. It's more like ZOMG WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THIS. It tastes a bit of a spicier, richer oregano, maybe a hint of cumin. If you love good food, and you love Italian, please treat yourself and try this stuff.

It's great hot or iced, but I particularly like to brew it for iced tea. It's got that cherry sweetness but is rich in flavor and a bit tangy, too. I'll be buying more of this. Good with or without honey or other sweetener. Use enough teabags when you brew (at least one per six ounces of hot water, and let it steep for at least five minutes) and you'll get nice, intense flavor.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I am also new to canning preserves and am making a lot of jelly from pure fruit juice. I made 3 half-pint jars using one bottle, with a bit leftover, and using reduced-sugar in my jelly which I like to do; it came out great, especially since there is no tartness now.  It depends what you're using it for.  I wanted it to for jelly, so it needed sugar anyway, and I wanted ONLY juice and nothing else.

Don't know, but I got one 12oz bag of the whole bean and even bought a cheap coffee grinder for it. After trying it, went back and bought 3 more bags.....wish now, that I would have bought a case. The price was phenominal - ending up being .50/oz, compared to Starbuck's price of .81/oz and Amazon's price of .74/oz. I REALLY did get a great deal at TJ, but alas, that story's over. Amazon's price is good and this is where I'll order going forward, now that I'm hooked!

2887	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	These almonds taste pretty good, especially when you consider they are  pre-packaged and delivered via UPS or other means of delivery, and thus are in storage in bags and warehouses for a period of time. I don't particularly accept all the claimed benefits of "organic," though I would like to believe all those claims. Many of those claims are bogus, and the assertions are mostly voluntary. It's just tough for the average consumer to wade through all the various "facts" and contradictions. I don't buy any that add salt! I like them raw, and I eat them as an energy snack at work, raw and healthy!!
With all this talk about artificial sweeteners, then, I think that Celestial tea should sell the Pumpkin Tea with no sweeteners and we can add our own sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener of our choosing.

We made the mistake of putting them in the refridgerator and the next day, they seemed to have lost their flavor. Just a thought to include directions in how to keep the fruit from spoiling for those of us who do not know. Thanks!

Wakame is also good as a salad. Rehydrate in water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and cut into desired lengths. Add some julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad. Top with a Japanese-style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice.

CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for "ultrapurified," a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.

The reason I love it is the flavor and the piquant character balance one another. Of course the piquant factor dominates the flavor profile (although this is not super spicy to my palate). The garlic is easily detected, but the surprise is the sweet aspect of the flavor profile, which seems to dominate more than the salt.

I just add black and cayenne pepper to raise or lower heat value. They are  a huge hit with friends. The sweet hardwood is just that, nice subtle sweet and smokey taste. Another think i will do if i want more smokiness is to add a few drops of liquid smoke. I have yet to make a batch of bad jerky with these seasoning.
I have read some people don't like that this doesn't taste much like green tea or taste mostly like mint etc. This tea can taste many different ways depending on how you prepare it.

1219	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Just received my first can today.  I wanted to compare them with my favorite Virginia peanuts from Royal Oak I received yesterday.  I had them open side by side.  Feridies peanuts are saltier, but not to me objectionably so.  Their flavor is as good as Royal Oak, but no better.  The size of Feridies peanuts are SMALLER than the Royal Oak.  Among the Royal Oak peanuts are a number that can truly be considered "extra, extra" large.  I didn't find one in the Feridies can that could match that description.  Of course even Costco brand makes the same claim to size and they aren't.  I wonder if there actually is an official grading system for size.  I doubt it.  Both are crunchy but in a different way.  The Royal Oak peanuts are blistered while the Feridies are not.  Yet both are crunchy.  Taste wise they are both the same which makes sense since they are both cooked in peanut oil.  In fact many Virginia grown peanut brands are not.  Others use cheap soybean oil to cook their peanuts.  The heads of those companies should be taken out and shot, at least in my opinion.  I give Feridies peanuts four stars while I give Royal Oak fiver stars.  Why?  Because Royal Oak is cheaper by a few bucks per can.

A little fascinating tidbits about "eleuthero" I found on the net:
Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.

I used 8 drops in an ice cream called "Savannah Buttermint", and it added a substantial, deep butter flavor.  The ingredient seems perfectly good for home cooking, though since 8 drops delivered so much flavor, I don't see how I'll ever use the rest of the bottle.

4119	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I was on an Atkins diet for six months, and this product helped me stay on my diet.  It's delicious and flavored with Splenda--which is a big plus for me since aspartame gives me migraines.  While on Atkins, I modified the mix by using half cream and half water instead of the recommended skimmed milk.  It fluffed up faster that way and had less carbs.  After I had gastric bypass surgery, I tried eating it using skim milk but found that the added whipped air in the mousse didn't sit well on my post-surgery stomach.  (Air/gas is not a gastric bypass patient's friend.)  It's been over three months now, so I'm willing to give it another try.  I would hate to give this stuff up because it's the best I've found (Jello brand sugar free cheesecake pudding tastes like wallpaper paste--a horrible consistency and flavor!)  Here's hoping that I can tolerate the whipped mousse again!

I discovered by accident that if I make a gallon of green tea (4 quart sized bags) and add a couple of bags of this into the mix it mellows out the flavor. I've tried plain Chamomile but this (IMHO) is better. The vanilla is what seems to come through the strongest for me in this blend and I've kind of gotten hooked on it.

4423	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Good butter fat flavor substitute for a vegetarian. I will imitation butter flavor extract in my vegetarian meat substitute, dairy-free ice cream, and other recipes where can be replaced with a vegetable oil.
The product is actually a mostly-sugar syrup with black specks of ground vanilla beans.  I expected a more intensely "vanilla" product than "extract", but the "paste" is actually less intense.
By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners. The answer quickly became high-fructose corn syrup, the price of which continues to be kept low through government subsidies for corn growers. Damn the taste, we know what fat Americans with dead taste buds want!
That way, it cost you nearly nothing (except of course the cost and toil of raising your lovely garden initially) to have a readily available and fresh food source at hand.

4445	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I was ready to throw the set out after one use and wish I had not wasted my money on this particular Wilton product. I highly suggest that you put the money toward another brand such as KopyKake pens or Americolor. The Wilton tips are too thick, yes including those labeled "fine tip", and although sufficient to fill in colors or make thick lines, you will be disappointed using on any design that calls for a thin line. If it were the only one of it's type out there, that would be a different story but it isn't.

2626	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Yummy tea. We started buying these bulk deals on celestial seasonings iced black tea about a year ago when we decided to stop drinking sodas and drink something more healthy. This tea is really tasty and one order lasts us practically forever. The trick is to actually boil the bags anyway. If you do, it makes much more/stronger tea than regular non-cold brew iced tea. We bought a 5 gallon glass pitcher with a spout. We boil six bags of tea in a one gallon pot, then we dump that pot into the 5 gallon pitcher with four gallons of water in it. Since this is black cool brew tea that we boiled, 6 bags makes five gallons of tea for us. The pitcher fits neatly in the fridge, and so we have strong, cold flavored tea on tap for very little. When we are looking to do something fancy, we make Arnold Palmers with the tea by adding lemon juice and sugar. We got a nice little system down, you should try it. Make sure you measure wherever you plan to put the glass pitcher/dispenser in your fridge and you buy one that fits. Taller is better as the tea comes out easier and it takes less room. We have tried both the raspberry and peach flavors. We like the raspberry a little bit better, but the peach is a close second. Enjoy!

I especially like a few arranged on the top of my muffins to show which muffins have nuts.  It works great if you have family members who do not prefer nuts.  The bonus is that the nuts on top come out of the oven light, toasty and delicious.
P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open next Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.

So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.

My mom used these colours to make my birthday cake. I went to have another piece 3 days later and the lovely lilac color had turned into a murky blue. The colours don't just change into another attractive colour they go into horrible dingy colours - supposing I had sold a wedding cake and it had changed colour before the day?!

It is a rather small container, but after going through an entire container of awase miso paste, I still have over half of this container left. One thing to keep in mind though, is that a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon will not fit in the mouth of this thing.

9924	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Years ago I was diagnosed as hypoglycemic and although I'm careful about nutrition, still today I function far better and stay in much better health if I avoid sugar and other high-glycemic sweeteners such as honey, agave syrup, etc. Maltitol, used in purchased products such as chocolate, has been acceptable and enjoyable, with no ill side effects. However, when in restaurants or otherwise away from home I had never found a packeted sweetener, such as Splenda, Sweet n' Low, etc. that provided an enjoyably good, clean, naturally sweet taste for beverages or foods. When I recently discovered information about Stevita Supreme and found positive reviews at amazon.com, I ordered a 50-pkt. box and have now used most of the box. For me, Stevita Supreme provides a very pleasant taste, very similar to sugar, with no aftertaste or unpleasant effects. I use it in an organic decaffeinated green tea with natural mango, peach and pineapple flavoring, a very enjoyable and light-tasting hot tea. The Stevita Supreme, one packet in an 8-ounce cup of tea, is delicious, exactly the right amount of sweetening. Also I have used a few packets in baking carob brownies and am very pleased with the results for that. I like that Stevita Supreme is made from the rebaudiana bertoni type of stevia, which I understand is the highest quality stevia obtainable. Of course each user of sweeteners has to find his or her own favorite taste. I particularly appreciate that the Stevita Supreme is non-glycemic and, with the small amount of xylitol, extracted from birch trees and added for flow (non-clumping), this product is derived entirely from natural plant sources. Last week I ordered and have received a second 50-packet box. The price is very reasonable and the shipping from amazon.com, received two days after ordering. could hardly be more prompt.

> "Extract" is vanilla flavor in alcohol. "Paste" is ground vanilla in sugar syrup. In my limited experience, "extract" is more intensely "vanilla" but the alcohol flavor interferes with use in uncooked (or lightly cooked) desserts--for example, in home-made ice-cream, or in a glass of vanilla-milk, or pudding.

I had an iron-clad stomach in my 20's and now, a few years later, I can still take a lot of heat that would leave a lot of men I know writhing on the floor. (My father and grandfather apparently gave me their 'hot food' genes!) That being said, this Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce is very pleasant: it does have some heat, and it does have nice flavor. I have yet to try it 'straight' but, mixed into a spoonful or two of natural mayonnaise, it made the free-range chicken I roasted last night taste like hot wings! I started out with one drop, as advised by the bottle, but after I realized I certainly could take more heat than that, I added a nice dribble of the sauce to the mayonnaise concoction. Again, if I took it straight, maybe I'd feel more impressed with the 'heat' aspect of this nice sauce; yet as it is, I enjoyed it very much with my lunch but have honestly found certain large, raw garlic cloves much hotter. Those I can actually feel burning my belly. This hot sauce is just a nice punch of heat with a pleasant, spicy flavor. It smells wonderful when you take the cap off of the bottle!

How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer's Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII.

Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary ("All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible"), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.

6196	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'm usually very wary of products that get really good reviews from people I don't know.  Well, I bought this anyway.  And the reviews were spot dead-on!  This is a very delicious product, as sweet as I wanted it to be, no more.  I understood that it was fresh from a beehive, so I didn't expect it to be anything but that.  And that's exactly that is what it is.  Very, very, very good.  I'm usually stingy with superlatives, but this time, I'll give it a 5 star and three verys.  It's that good.  When I'm done (it will be a while) I'll order it again. And then again.  And husband loves it too, and wants biscuits NOW.

7890	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea is a great mix of mild, peppery lemon and a hint of ginger. It's great with hot water, but if you want a creamy, lighter taste of lemon ginger, add milk to it. If you want your tea stronger, I suggest adding 2 teabags to hot water. The tea has a light, refreshing scent of lemon and ginger. (Doesn't smell like Lemon Pledge like another reviewer said.)

7549	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I like this tea. It's a lot different from chai teas, it's a lot spicier. I can definitely taste the cinnamon. I don't need sugar for the tea because it's sweet on its own which is purfect for me because I'm trying to consume less sugar in my diet. It's a great tea to add milk or cream to because it's so strong. My brother tried the tea and he compared it to Big Red chewing gum and he likes it. My mother on the other hand, compared it to Father John cough syrup and was not so crazy about it but we all agreed it was definitely sweet.

Thank you, Amazon, for carrying these wonderful imported treasures.

After I read about all the health benefits, I decided to order some to experiment.  I do not cook a lot so I did not want to start out with a huge quantity.  I had used Frontier spices before so I chose this small bottle.  I was very pleased when it came with a best by date that was more than a couple of years away.  However, after successfully trying this tasty spice in several soups and savory dishes, I know that I will be reordering it on a regular basis.

I'm glad to have found these almonds here on Amazon for the same price per pound I was paying at Whole Foods when I buy 4lbs at a time. However, it's really unfortunate that we must resort to buying these from overseas. Luckily these almonds are by far the best almonds I have ever had.

I'm a hot sauce fanatic and I love habenero hot sauces, but habenero hot sauce just doesn't work on a taco like this stuff does. I always thought it did, and it is very yummy, but not like this stuff on Tex mex or Mexican chow. I live in Upstate New York and travel a lot for business. I buy this stuff on the west coast for $1.29 a bottle at the grocery store, bubble wrap it and bring it home in my luggage. I think about this hot sauce some times. It's amazing. To put it in perspective for you west coasters, I hate Tapatio. It's got too much vinegar. This stuff does not. I would like to thank the creator of this hot suace, because it's that good.

I like Chai Tea, but sometimes the "smokiness" of the chai can be overwhelming to me.  This tea combines the lovely sweetness of coconut with the dark rich quality of the chai.  The aroma is a treat as well.  Everyone I have made this for LOVES this tea.  When I brew this tea, I am able to use one tea bag for 2-3 cups of hot water and it still is flavorable.  I drink it with a small amount of cream and one artificial sweetner, but many of my friends like it without any sweetner at all.  I highly recommend this tea.
The flaxseed itself is wonderful and fresh.  I use it, and I also put it in my dog's food as it helps with older dogs and kidney problems.

And of all the malted milk balls I've ever tried, WHOPPERS Malted Milk Balls are easily the worst quality, junk candies. For years they've had unacceptable numbers of duds; they've also been made of inferior ingredients, including hydrogenated oils and fats, which are horrible because trans-fats can't be properly digested by the human body. I'd love to see a candy company put out a decent brand of malted milk balls. Sadly, WHOPPERS are, in my view, not fit for human consumption.

Normally I don't like much (if any) vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular variety of Valentina.

I've tried basically every brand. I bought this because it's advertised as soft licorice. However, it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor. The flavor is nice. The consistency and texture is terrible. I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale, but the next package was the same. I threw away both packages.
7126	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'm not even sure where I originally purchased this, maybe Costco. I love making soup and chili especially now that it's fall. I use this (chicken) in both soups and chilis regardless of the meat that I'm using. I also use it to cook rice and quinoa as well as other various dishes. It's probably past expiration but doesn't seem affected. I'm at the bottom of the jar and since I could not find this in my regular grocery store of course I looked to Amazon to save the day. Literally. I can't live without this stuff. This time though, I actually ordered the Organic Reduced Sodium Roasted Chicken in the larger size. Don't misunderstand - this one is absolutely delicious, but I wanted to opt for a reduced sodium variety since I use it so often. Before this, I was using the box broths (usually some reduced sodium organic chicken variety when I could find it). It became inconvenient, wasteful, and expensive. It was more difficult to keep the boxes on hand and use the remainder of broth after opening before it went bad. This base is far more convenient and also way more delicious! I'll be coming back to try out some of the other flavors by BtB!
2105	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	The sauce is very good and a bit too spicy for me.  It has very good flavor.  I wish it came in mild.
8866	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	We've tried every kind of salt imaginable for a variety of cooking.  This salt is excellent on popcorn and veggies.  It is so fine that it gives you all of the flavor without that crunch.  A little goes a long way so be careful when pouring from the container.  About the container... Put it in something else if you can.  Just remember - those cute theater shakers rust to beat the band.  If you are going to use them - unscrew the lid when finished and cover the container with a baggie - then screw the lid back on.  Keeps the salt fresh and dry and helps the container last longer.  Just my opinion of course.
6210	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This honey has an excellent flavor, especially after i set it in warm tap water (100-110 degrees F) for about an hour to get it real creamy. The sweetness is perfect, the creamy body is just right and it just has a downright nice "honey taste".

No, it isn't quite as smooth as Kraft mac and cheese powder, but it's still great for what it is.  I put it on steamed veggies, and it is just yummy. I may have to take a little extra time to break up a few little lumps, but honestly, I kind of like getting an extra strong taste of cheese powder with the occasional lump.

5921	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Not to be confused with the other honey they sell... This is the organic version. I, like others was confused when I ordered the other version of the honey they have due to the name of the company and the description (talked about how they are able to harvest honey organically). This is still good quality but comes in a glass jar instead of the plastic one of the non-organic honey. It is thick but I do like it that way. You won't have to worry about it getting everywhere and it still has a great flavor. This is by far, way better than any store bought honey. I was never a huge fan until now. It is a little pricey but so is everything else organic. Sad to say that you have to pay more to get what we should already be getting in the first place.

8540	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	I really hate giving this a 2 star review. I really do enjoy the taste and simplicity of the packaging! We simply dump it into our jar and go on about our day. It's very good in all of our "cheesy" vegan recipes.  Popcorn, cheese sauce, mac n cheese, gravy, soup, etc. I routinely toss nutritional yeast into something I'm cooking at every meal. Tasty stuff!  However, having just read a report mentioning this brand having elevated levels of lead, I cannot recommend it or purchase it any longer. It's not a huge amount, and many others are still probably comfortable with it, but we tend to be overly cautious in our family. I have purchased from this company on multiple occasions with a variety of products and always been pleased. I will be waiting to see what the company does to change their lead levels and possibly purchase from them again in the future. For now I will stick to Bobs Red Mill, Bragg, Dr. Fuhrman, Red Star, or NOW Foods nutritional yeast.

I am pleased to report that this bar was delicious!  The chocolate/coconut blend is quite reminiscent of the flavor of a Mounds chocolate bar and not artificial tasting at all--rather, it was rich and chewy, with no unpleasant aftertaste.  In addition, the nutrition profile of this bar is comparable to other Luna bars:  190 calories, 7 grams fat (a bit high, but only 3.5 grams saturated, and no trans fats), 25 grams total carbs, including 3 grams fiber and only 11 grams of sugar, and 9 grams of protein.  Furthermore, the bar is fortified with various vitamins and minerals, from 35% of daily recommendation for Calcium to good amounts of most of the B vitamins.

9868	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Although each person's set of taste buds seem to respond differently to each brand of Stevia, here's my impression.  Stevia Supreme by Stevita was the most bitter, a truly unpleasant and long lasting after taste. I threw it away. Sweet Leaf had a strong chemical taste, as well as being quite bitter. It immediately joined Stevita in the trash bin.. Now's Stevia was not bitter, and not bad tasting, although it had an odd flavor overtone, perhaps a bit nut-like? It would take a wine connoisseur to properly describe this flavor. I did keep it.

I use almond butter instead of peanut butter, add a little more salt, and if the recipe calls for vanilla, it works without that just fine.  I also add either cocoa nibs or just regular old chopped up Toll-House semi-sweet choc chips, but you could use carob chips or leave them out altogether.

Just remember that this is a finishing salt so don't waste it by cooking with it-- use it after the food has been plated.  I actually keep a small container of it on the dinner table so that it is always right there.  BEST. SALT. EVER!
8279	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea is herbal, but tastes like a smooth regular tea.  Makes great hot tea or cold tea.  I especially like it hot with a teaspoon of honey-mmm delicious.

I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings, or add a dab to any taco sauce, however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible.

But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is "Peppermint".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea.

Update: July, 2013.

Thank you for your email.  MSG was first produced from a seaweed broth in 1908, and today disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate can both be produced from fish or dried seaweed - although typical production of these ingredients now uses different raw materials. These flavor enhancers often work in conjunction with MSG to create a more complete flavor profile.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I know there are some die-hard Blair fans out there.  I will try and compare the two in as simple a way as I can.  While I prefer Dave's for the reasons mentioned above, I do acknowledge that Blair has managed to get much "hotter" mixtures and have a more of a "gen-x" or "bad ass" marketing campaign.  They will offer you insanely hot sauces, that aren't really sauces because they're simply pure extract.  Anyone can make extract that'll make your rectum erupt, but to make a sauce that is actually flavorful is the kicker.  The closest sauce to Dave's Insanity would probably be After Death.  The spice level is pretty similar, but Blair's has a grainy, almost sandy texture to it that kind of eats away at your palette.  My experience with Dave's has been the opposite, as it is smooth and has a nice texture to it.
With the Cappicino one I also add a T. or more of strong instant coffe or instant espresso.  It makes it much richer.

After canning,  I did have to leave the jars in the water bath for a longer time.  The first jars boiled over a bit when i removed them at the recommended time.  The clear jel filling keeps the pie filling very hot for a long time and there was some leakage if the jars are removed too soon.
Decent zing; not really hallucination-worthy*, but definitely a nice, even burn from the very first bite.  Great flavor - Dave's original insanity sauce is OK for kicking it up a notch, but lacks any real depth; this sauce makes up for it and then some!  It has a far more robust and somewhat fruity flavor profile, not just "pure white heat".  Definitely worth every penny - this will become a permanent addition to my condiment cabinet.  :)

Well, I'm converted and now an adventurer in different salts. This one has larger flakes than you may be used to and a much more intense salty taste. I think that perhaps regular salt is so adulterated with fillers and additives that the taste gets lost.

It has an excellent flavor and heat, and must be used in very small amounts, or it is more of a Bhut Jolokia experience, rather than enjoying some really hot sauce. a drop or two is really all that is necessary. I was very happy to find it again here, and bought 2! That will likely last a good 5 years. Like I said, it's a few drops hot sauce for us picante heads! The 4 oz bottle is much larger that the last one I got as a gift, so that really rocks too. If you love habanero's like I do, you need this sauce! You will sweat. :)

This mix is the best of yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate.  If you are looking for a more milk-chocolate flavor, try it with a little sweetener and milk.  The hint of chocolate gives this yerba mate a more bitter flavor closer to coffee than the plain yerba matte but without the coffee acid and reduced caffeine.  Yerba mate is a good flavor in itself and not just as a coffee substitute.  The chocolate gives us yerba mate fans some variety in flavors.

9348	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	As the other reviewer said, this is NOT top-of-the line fancy-schmantzy stuff - but, then, I've never HAD that sort of caviar (only what friends have bought off the shelf at local grocery stores).  This is better than any of those, and it arrived super-quickly.  I served it at a New Year's Eve appetizer buffet at the home of friends, with a cream cheese/chive base, chopped hardboiled eggs, and ringed with chopped parsley and two types of rather plain crackers.  Everyone either loved it, or at least found it OK.  I would certainly buy it again if I'm ever asked to do a caviar appetizer in the future.  I'm only giving it four stars because it is NOT fancy gourmet caviar, but it has a relatively mild fishy taste, and is not too salty (and it's a very attractive bright red color).  I read on the Internet that you're not supposed to use metal utensils with caviar, so I prepared the appetizer presentation with rubber spatulas, and placed some plastic knives left over from a summer picnic around the edges of the platter.

6154	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	It was...different. I am sp used to processed foods it actually tasted quite odd. I like it though, I used it for my homemade cinnamon-rolls yesterday and they came out so mouth-watering delicious. I also Used it in my hair this morning along with hot oil to condition my hair & my hair is sooooooo soft. I have very dry curly hair and it brought the bounce and shine back into my curls!! :)
9753	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	If there was a negative rating, I'd give it. I am sorry to say that this is one of the worst things I have ever consumed. The taste is wretched and my stomach ached for two hours after eating an ounce. I usually order Hoosier Farm sweetened chips, which are very good. I tried to break the sugar habit a little more and decided to try these-big mistake. I tried to request a refund that they were so bad, but they don't allow it, which is a joke. Avoid these things at all costs, they are flat-out disgusting. Keep in mind, I do not feel comfortable giving negative reviews, but I don't want anyone else to have to deal with this junk.
3876	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great product.

4615	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tastes a lot like Miracle Whip.  If you like that flavor then get some.  It does take a while to ship but I have used it in noodles and sandwiches so far and it does taste good.
Having said all that, it looses one star for having MSG in its ingredients. I'm also not happy that the price is so high (higher than other brands, no matter where you buy it). I always wonder, how would it taste without the MSG and caramel color. The color is naturally brown, so I don't see why coloring is needed. And salt is already a great flavor enhancer so I wonder why add MSG. I'm still searching for a great tasting oyster sauce with no MSG (and not so expensive) but haven't found one yet. When I do I'll be sure to post that info here for you all.
7185	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is absolutely the best chicken bouillon base that I have found!  It is rich, thick and full of flavor!  It has more REAL CHICKEN FLAVOR than any other base.  I get wonderful compliments when I use this in the holiday turkeys to baste them, as well as to flavor the stuffing and vegetables!  Adding a tablespoon of "Better Than Bouillon" chicken even adds a delicious layer of flavor to a big pot of chili.  In fact, I would simply bore you with all of the recipes that have been improved with the addition of my "secret ingredient"!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!
If you like heat, but are tired of every Hot Sauce tasting like a cross between Tabasco and Buffalo Wing Sauce, you should give this a try.
9112	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff.  The taste is salty - but fresh...nothing like table salt.  It enhances anything, but is pretty spectacular on foods where salt is the star.  Try a sprinkling on a freshly grilled steak, or a slice of perfectly ripe watermelon.  Perfection!  If you have never purchased a finishing salt, this is an excellent one with which to start.  It is not as unique as some others, but the price is right and the taste is there for a beginner.  It may seem crazy to spend $$$& on salt - but you WILL see a difference!

1381	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.  I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby.

BTW "star anise" or "aniseed" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish.
This is also great mixed with a little water added to your taste preferences and then frozen into popsicles.

That and, unlike the Good Earth varieties lately, I don't have to worry about getting the caffeinated tea variety by mistake with Celestial Seasonings. It's clear that their product is just herbal tea.

The reason that pasteurized almonds came about was due that in 2003 & 2004, 29 people became ill from eating almonds bought at Costco because they were contaminated with salmonella. Because of unsanitary conditions in the processing plant that sold the almonds they became contaminated with salmonella. Rather than force all processing facilities to maintain proper handling, constant sanitation and clean and sanitary processing facilities, they chose to adopt mandatory pasteurization of almonds instead.
9811	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is amazing. It only we can get it in our local grocers as it is pricey to ship soda but this is worth it.

The sauces really make the Potstickers and bring the WOW flavor to them. Most recipes say to use Rice Vinegar and Soy Sauce together, but I found using the Black Vinegar with Soy Sauce is a thousand times more delicious! We then found we love to use this sauce on everything- over rice, chicken, ribs, Potstickers- it is too delicious for words. Black Vinegar is simply rice vinegar with caramel and a couple more ingredients, and it has a sweeter, smoky flavor that is out of this world! For the Best Dipping Sauce ever, you simply use equal parts Black Vinegar and Soy Sauce. We use the Light Soy Sauce, as we have to watch the sodium, and after trying a few diffferent brands of Black Vinegar, we found Koon Chun's Black Vinegar is so delicious! After stirring the equal parts Light Soy Sauce and Black Vinegar together, you just add thinly sliced green onions in- and that's it! The BEST Dipping Sauce ever! Rice Vinegar is more sour in taste and not as delicious, and in comparison the smoky sweetness of the Chinese Black Vinegar can't be beat!

Finally, it is excellent to make a sandwich with a good crusty bread with manchego cheese !
The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever.

In fact I found the pollen to be closer to finely shopped fennel seeds than anything else. That said, it is a great quality product and compliments foods well, in any case that fennel seeds would. The flavoring is more concentrated, so you need less pollen than you would use with seeds. Therefore a tin of this size will last a lot longer than the equivalent size tin of seeds. Overall, I would recommend the fennel pollen, just do not expect it to be different in flavor to standard fennel seeds.

4416	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Very good item, perfect for buttercream icing. You can trust Wilson to deliver a good product. Will buy again for sure.
16	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Good tea. Way better than baseline Lipton tea. The baseline Lipton tea is more of a powder, where this tea is in a granular-form. It brews much better/more efficiently. It has a really deep (almost chocolate-like) flavor. Much deeper/more potent than their bagged tea. I usually prefer Lipton teas, however, I did not give it 5-stars because while it is good, it is not as good as some others (Tetley, PG Tips, Taylors and Peet's, now Mighty Leaf. Orange Pekoe tea is considered (in the U.S.) as a budget tea and not a premium tea. This Lipton tea is priced accordingly.
5254	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I just switched over to using this product as it is the only brewer's yeast that I can find that is organic.  Even Whole Foods only has brewer's yeast marked "natural" which means nothing.  This brewer's yeast also has a mild taste and doesn't have to be disguised, though I put it in my whey protein shake with a tablespoon of raw organic cacao and some stevia and it is fabulous.  This stuff is loaded with vitamins, minerals and amino acids and is a good source of fiber since I am allergic to chia, flax, and psyllium which don't have the nutritional value of the brewer's yeast in any case.  Excellent product.
1819	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Not that great. Certainly not worth the cost. To be honest, the recipe on the back of a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips makes a far better, far fresher cookie.  I wouldn't waste my money on these.
I've had this tea alone and it misses something (in my taste preferences) and the pepper taste is strong in an unpleasant way. It mellows out if I add milk or cream. But since I prefer stronger flavors in my Chai, I add all of the above. The milk is crucial because without it the tea will be bitter.
9033	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This salt is cool as it is flaky and adds character when you pinch it over your finished dish.
4305	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Looks exactly as advertised. We're going to be using it in an indie, in place of gold dust. It looks good on camera.
6572	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My daughter-in-law got some in NYcity, and when I searched online, I got them cheaper and package was delivered to the door.  This is an awesome product.
1864	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Always fresh and delicious! A winner with every cookie lover.
1004	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Nesco jerky seasoning is AMAZING. I mix the seasoning and cure in about 2 tablespoons of seasoning and then add to my meat. The resulting jerky is AMAZING.

A good price and it arrived the next day!

8711	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	When i buy nuts in bulk, i prefer to get unsalted so i can add the amount i want. This stuff is ground to a powder and sticks great.
8704	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the best all around multi-purpose salt. Wonderful on anything.
So the main flavor is pepper and lime.  Love it.
3296	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Only negative is that the bag is empty now. They are just TOO YUMMY, AND, I ain't never had too much licorice (or too much fun). Great stuff.

9958	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a great tasting brand of Stevia. Price is excellent too.
This was part of a Pantry order, and the package arrived intact and fresh.

7990	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This flavor is very good if you love sweet fruity flavored teas! I would recommenced it to anyone I know who loves tea to be part of their assortments.
6208	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	There is double the taste when you get the organic honey.  I ate one pound in a month just in my coffees.  Very cheap if you look around.
3505	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I tried this coffee today. as soon as i opened the can i noticed there is not even a bit of coffee aroma.. i guess its full of chicory and very less coffee. i have tasted lot of coffee and chicory coffee but this one tastes awful.  i have to throw this can now.  price is really high for this kind of coffee.  waste of money.
It is not the product in the picture, it is a lower quality variety
3514	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love this coffee. Bought some while in Louisiana a few years ago and was happy to find it to order on Amazon for a great price.
8105	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	The "most critical" review says:
9733	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My mom turned 50 years old recently, and I had to bake 75 cupcakes for her surprise party. Because her favorite color is green, I browsed green, silver, and black sugars. This green was absolutely gorgeous. It is almost a white/silver, but has just a teeny hint of green. It is sanding sugar, so the granules are small. I'd say I'd buy it again, but I still have about 3/4 of a pound, so I don't know that I'll need to. If I somehow use 12 oz of colored sugar, I would absolutely purchase this a second time. I also purchased the green and black sanding sugars. They have really intense colors, and they blended very nicely with this.
718	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I do love this product.  I don't bake a cake without it.
7698	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	All chamomile...nothing but chamomile!
8149	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	What a delicious, soothing, calming tea that caps off the night perfectly! Also, if you suffer from stomach problems (as I do) this tea tends to help calm it down a bit. It's worth it. The hint of honey paired with the tranquilizing chamomile is the perfect way to end the night.
5909	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Tastes great!
1	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Gift for college student.
4827	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Put these in my smoothie for extra fiber! Great nutty taste!

9307	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the only sea salt I'll use now. This has the right texture, size, and taste for all my cooking needs. Just a small amount sprinkled on food gives an abundance of flavor. The package is comes in is an added bonus. Try it--you'll love it!
1675	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I LIKE CHEESE A LOT SO I PRETTY MUCH LIKE ALL CHEESES. THIS PACK IS MORE ON THE CHEDDAR CHEESE TASTE.

I am cutting back on sweets so I don't know if I will be buying more of the big bags. But if I do, Jaret's Swedish Fish will be my choice.
9452	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I could not wait to enjoy one out of the box upon arrival.  Really good quality.  Panda's other great product is their "soft chew licorice pieces" also on the Amazon website.
The shipping part was the only small downside.
Take a piece of high quality dense bread like Ezekiel bread, lightly toast it to bring out the nuttiness, then liberally apply a swab of raw honey to make a little piece of heaven on earth- delicious!

3142	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The flavor is excellent, probably in my Top 10 of hot sauces. Don't be fooled by the "Death Sauce" moniker. It's pretty mild. Even people unaccustomed to hot peppers will find this sauce "medium hot". True chili heads will find it very mild and more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. Overall , it's a superb mild hot sauce with unparalleled flavor and I recommend it highly, unless you're seeking a truly hot hot sauce.
6817	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	The Jammin' Lemon Ginger tea tastes like some kind of housecleaning product.  Kind of a lemony pinesol if you will.  Adding sugar or honey does not improve the flavor.  If I want lemon ginger tea in the future, I'm going back to the Yogi lemon ginger tea which I find has a much better flavor without reminding me in the slightest of floor cleaners.
7851	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Always best is best Celestial Seasonings Fruit Tea Sampler, this is my second ordered and very good flavors tea sampler...

3187	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	What more can you ask for...your favorite flavor of jelly beans and a great brand.  my son-in-law loved them.
Overall:  I definitely recommend.  Especially with the subscribe & save pricing, you can't buy good-quality gum at a better price!  And the bubble gum flavor is a sweet little treat that reminds you of when you were a kid.
3907	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Pretty darn good.
8	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Well I bought this tea after being in Malaysia for several months, mostly to try making teh tarik without using loose tea as we did several times. I failed with regular Lipton black tea, thought the difference must be because of Yellow label. That turned out to be wrong, the problem is the condensed milk which is clearly different in Malaysia than what I've been able to get in the U.S.
7301	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Wife likes it.
This drink definitely satisfies my sweet tooth, and I recommend trying it like this to anyone, especially those who are unsatisfied with the tea's flavor when it's made with water. Great treat for a fraction of calories/
My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution.

4974	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I have found multiple uses for the ground flax seed. I use on salads of multiple types. I use on a garden salad and I use when I make tuna salad. I use with Agave on my waffles in the morning which is a great way to start the day. I will use in chicken salad the next time I make it. The only draw back is closing the pouch it comes in. Sometimes the two sides don't line up properly. Otherwise it is a very useful product.
65	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is good stuff! But if you can't take the heat, like my family can't, just use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for. Then it's the perfect amount of heat and spice.
Nelsen-Massey is a trusted company with safe processing. There is nothing like real high quality vanilla extract and I won't risk using products made in a third world country who may be cutting or tainting the product to make a higher profit.
7933	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	One word: amazing. This stuff is great, we use it in a million recipes. It's very versatile and high quality.
8506	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Quality and energy expected from Clif with good flavor.  Four stars because this is a little too 'cool' tasting for me.  That is a personal preference and others may really enjoy it.
8129	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The tea is excellent and buying bulk allowed me to pay a much cheaper price w/o tax AND it was delivered to my door.  What more could ask other than to have the UPS guy come in and make the tea for me. I say YES to this purchase if you are considering.
8896	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a superfine salt perfect for salting fresh popped popcorn, nuts, french fries, and other things that you want salt to stick to.

2750	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This raspberry cool brew is delicious, caffeine-free and so easy to make. I put a bag into the bottom of a glass, put some ice on top and add filtered water. 5 minutes later it's fully brewed :)  I found that Amazon has a better price on it than I can buy it for in individual boxes at the market.  This tea is refreshing, tasty, and if you search for the benefits of drinking raspberry tea, you'll be pleased :)
3943	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Looking for a cheaper gluten-free flour?  Look no further.  They don't mill wheat, so it's gluten-free with no chance of cross-contamination--unlike virtually every other brand of corn flour out there, except Publix, which is only available in four U.S. states.
3157	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Tasty Cherry flavor and last a long time.

5595	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this honey. Better substitute for sugar. I use in my morning coffee
5380	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I like the product.  YS says it is organic yet the USDA Organic Logo you see on so many other Organic Products is not present.  To some degree this makes me question the quality of the product.  Hopefully YS will have the Organic Logo on the product in the future.

9355	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	As with the Black Lumpfish Caviar,  this product left me with an overwhelming fish taste and heavy salt after taste.  It also left  me crapping a pink / red color for a couple of days.  I would not buy this product and am waiting for this
3818	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Love this product! I originally bought it to use when making homemade marshmallows and now use it in multiple recipes. It is so tasty and works great. Glad it is available on Amazon.

6093	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Use in my baking, and frosting for my cinnamon rolls, my lactation cookies, my hair for deep conditioning, and my face to treat acne. (day 4 and irritation is calming down and pores are getting smaller) Its all around good uses, My son got a nasty big bite that looked like it was getting infected and IK put some honey on it with put a bandage and its starting to heal. LOVE THIS STUFF. I'm not even half way done and I use ALLOT of it in almost EVERYTHING.

7406	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite tea that I make almost every day. Unsweetened, it has a nice astringent, hibiscus bite to it, and if you add some honey it mellows into a delicious berry drink. Very cooling and refreshing.

what the jar says on the lobster base:
If you are looking for natural help with stress and all of the physical and emotional symptoms that comes along with that give the Tension Tamer tea a try. It is not always available in stores but every now and then I do see it. Can't depend on that! So, I buy this in the 6 box count from Amazon so that I never run out! I do not take any forms of tranquilizer whether be prescribed or not as those things never worked right for me. They gave me unwanted side effects and and are also addictive. Not going there. But, this tea, will drink it in a heartbeat! And, low and behold, it actually works!
621	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I like the deepness, though I usually mix 50:50 with something softer (like Dazbog Mocha Java). A little too bold for me to drink cup-after-cup of this straight.
8281	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love this peppermint tea, by Celestial Seasonings, so much.  It's great as an iced tea or brewed hot.  I've also noticed that when I have a stomach ache or a sore throat, this really helps me soothe my pain.  This is great tea to have around when company is coming and ideal when served with cookies or a nice slice of cake.

I do between 1/3 and 1 tsp of dashi per 1 cup of water.  1/3 for my daughters, 1/2 for my wife, and 1 tsp for me. Then I use between 1 and 2 tbsp of miso paste. White for the kids, 1 tbsp white and 1 tbsp red for the wife, and 2 tbsp red for me.

Compared to the brand I had been using -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Domino-Sugar-Cubes-Dots/dp/B0005Z7IAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Domino Sugar Cubes Dots</a>&nbsp;- these are a little denser and imparts a slightly different flavor. I use them with espresso (rarely for me, but frequently for guests) and they have elicited remarks and questions about the sugar. This piqued my interest because I served the cubes in a dish and they looked like any other cubes. I did a side-by-side comparison and these did impart a slightly different flavor to the espresso.
I can't find this flavor in the stores anywhere around here!!!

4213	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a really wonderful jam.  I bought it to go with a dessert recipe (grilled pound cake with jam and brie) and it was an excellent addition and was great in a simple PB&J later in the week.
The Panda product is similar to USP/NF pharmaceuticals that were prepared/sold in early/mid 1900's.

5447	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Like its sister product, the one with Ginseng, Bee Pollen, and Propolis, this is a wonderful product. Helps me most when I am stressed out. This one tastes more like honey... honey is added to make it sweet. I highly recommend this product.
The head in the photo is what we painted with the gold spray.  We used 1.5 cans of the spray because we had to spray it with a few coats to get full coverage and to prevent any drip marks.  It is very quick drying and we only waited a few minutes between coats.

4695	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	In my opinion, this is the best vanilla out there.  The flavor is good, you can buy it in huge bottles and it's got those cute little specks of vanilla bean in it.  I put vanilla in everything I bake, it's my favorite flavor.  Doesn't cook out, stays strong in your baked goodies.  Highly recommend.
Having immune-boosting properties, cinnamon also aids the digestive system.
About the piquant quality - this does have a slight bite and some spiciness, but if you can tolerate a serrano pepper you will not have any problems. For me I prefer a little more spiciness so I will often add some finely chopped bird's eye chilis to the sauce. Of course spiciness is both subjective and relative. If a jalapeno is too hot for you may want to avoid this. On the other hand, if a habanero is not enough, you will have to kick it up with additional peppers.
2692	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	For those looking for alternatives to coffee this is a very good substitute. I recommend this product for it's warm and satisfying  taste.

I've now had it on waffles(delicious) and poured over and mixed with plain yogurt (also delicious).  Goldem Syrup has a flavor unlike any other.  I've not tried using it in any recipe.  Once I can convert the metric directions to our mearurements, I will try cooking with it.  All in all, this is an interesting and flavorful experience.

Extremely poor packaging plus no food labeling - no ingredient list or manufacturer name/location (China?).  I don't think the brand name Jelly Belly would allow their product to be packaged this way, but there is no way to know the manufacturer since no labeling came with - or on- the product.

Each sample pouch consists of four-bags of Raspberry Zinger, Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, Cranberry Apple Zinger, and Tangerine Orange Zinger. There are no artificial additives, this is achieved naturally by the master blenders at the ever-reliable Celestial Seasonings, a company that has not compromised on consistent high-quality. The teas are not only wonderful hot, each flavor makes for refreshing pitchers of fruity iced tea. Enjoy!

I never waste a can of broth anymore-- make exactly what I need.  For me, it tastes much better, and depending upon what I am making, I can make it as strong or as weak as I want.

Lipton, Bigelow, Salada, even store brands, all make reasonable regular tea.  But herbal tea?  A resounding NO!  Especially orange herbal tea, which is my all-time favorite.  I just wasted my money trying a replacement brand.
I am totally impressed with quality of the Camellia Brand and I will be purchasing these again in the future!
4242	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	Someone gave me a jar of this and, after trying it, I won't be buying any in the future. Needs to be doctored up BIG TIME! I added fresh sauteed onions, peppers, and jalapenos as well as some chile de arbol. Also lots of oregano and cumin and garlic. This sauce has no heat despite the Tabasco label. Very disappointed. I do think it would make a good base for a salsa with fresh cilantro, green onion, and jalapeno or serrano peppers added along with a bit of lime juice. I live in New Mexico and we don't need starter for our chile!
9939	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Stevia is the perfect replacement for sugar.  It's been recommended to me by Naturopaths as being safer than other natural sweeteners, including agave which does have some negatives.  One packet does an excellent job of sweetening my morning whey shakes.

It works and  also adds vitamins, minerals and omega-3s to your diet. Adds a nutty taste and texture to cookies, muffins and even apple crisp. I prefer to use it in smoothies in order to retain all the nutrients. The only con is that I had to transfer the contents to another container as the resealable bag was defective. I just happened to get the one bag that did this, I'm sure. I will re-order this product as I like it very much and is an easy way to add fiber to the diet..

I touch them with my finger and they break apart/crumble.  With regular popcorn the hulls are hard and have a sharp edge and they do not break or crumble when touched...and they stick in my teeth.

It has a strong berry flavor which pleasantly surprised me. The texture takes some getting used to however. I wasn't quite sure what to expect so the taffy-like consistency was a surprise.

I could see myself trying out the other flavors of fruit smoothie bars and see if they taste as good as this one did.

I have even used beet powder to make candy canes (recipe at [...]  Instead of adding food coloring, just add some beet liquid AFTER taking the candy off the heat and cooling slightly. I have also used it in other hard candies, the only problem is that if the candy hardens before you have shaped it  you can't reheat it on the stove or the beet stuff will burn, turn brown, and taste nasty.  That only happens at very high temperatures, however. You can add beet powder to baked goods without burning it.

So what's not to like?  Everything you make yourself is going to be better, but who has the time to bake potatoes, cut them in half, scoop out the middle, mix it with more stuff, pipe it back into the potato shell, and bake them again?  If you have the time, don't buy these.  But if you're like me and you want something quick and easy to go with your steak or whatever, these are a good option to have on hand in your freezer.
In any case, this dashi powder is 85-90% as good as Bonito flakes. It's totally worth the almost double the price of the sachets, the only time I'll buy the sachets is when I'm cooking for a group of friends, otherwise I find if I'm not finishing the whole sachet in a week to a week and a half, it starts to lose flavor and starts to taste like my fridge. With this jar, I can keep the jar for months with no issue.

9175	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread. Some parts of your steak are saltier than others.

I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care.


1584	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Last year I purchased this product on a hunch at a local discount store(TM)at a tremendously discounted price. Now I am hooked. Works wonders on fish, but also terrific on potatoes, rice, eggs, chicken, steaks, Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles. It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt, black pepper, parsley, garlic, onion, lemon peel and green peppercorns. The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well.

3844	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is the go-to hot sauce at our house.  We use it in EVERYTHING.  Frankly, it's one of our secret ingredients.  The brilliance of this is that it is NOT vinegary, so doesn't add acidity to your dish, but does add an underwarmth, not a KICK.  If you use too much, it might be too spicy for some, but I use it in almost everything to give it a warm feel on the tongue...let's call it a "finish" of warmth. People who aren't familiar with it, love the subtle change it can make.  Recently won over an American lady when we made a huge batch of cole slaw for a bbq event.  I said, let's just add a touch to a "sample" and see what you think.  She couldn't believe the lovely change...clearly did not make it spicy, but the difference is remarkable.  I put it in: homemade salad dressings, homemade mayo, every type of soup and stew, caramel sauce, salsa, guacamole, spaghetti sauce, ham glaze, grilled cheese, chowders, chinese, omelette fillings, cheese sauces, rib rubs,  etc.  My daughter wishes it came on a key chain like sriracha...and I had to give her a bottle to keep at her boyfriend's...as everything tastes better with it.  If you use cayenne and/or red chili flakes to add just a teeny touch of heat to things,say, macaroni and cheese or au gratins,  try this as an alternative and revel in the difference!

Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.

I bought this directly from Amazon and it was packed well for shipping. The outer box was from Amazon and the inner sealed box contained the 12 cartons of Whoppers and had a date on the outside which I assume is the Sell By date or Expiration date. It is 9 months away and the candy tastes fine.

Update:  If you're worried about size and storage after opening, we just finished a jar that took almost 3 weeks to finish from the day we opened it.

7714	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and cloves. Those are just a few of the flavors you'll probably recognize when you first try this tea. The nice thing is that no added sweeteners are needed. It has a natural sweetness of its own. This is one of those tees that is just as good as an iced tea as it is hot. I drink it throughout the year. All of those flavors make me feel alert when I drink it. It really wakes up my mouth! And the nice thing is that it does it all without caffeine. If you like these spices, give this tea a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
I also mix it in with eggs when making french toast!  The sweetness added is all you really need, of course you need creme fresh or a dab of unsalted butter!

After, I removed all of the whole cloves except two and sightly pureed the mixture in a blender.  Now, it's an incredible, sweet and savory and FRAGRANT sauce/jam that I will use on all kinds of things, like ham glaze, as a jam on biscuits, toast, croissants, or even to puree even more and strain to make cocktails or sodas.  Try a toasted/grilled peanut butter n'pineapple jam sammy!  Or, grilled ham n cheese n pineapple jam sammy toasted w/butter and topped with sprinkling of confectioner's sugar??  :)  I could go on and on.  Make it into a 'salsa' and serve with hash browns and eggs.
8330	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have bought a number of Frontier spices, and have been very happy with all of them. This one is another that has more than met my expectations. Most of the spices bought from the store are much more expensive, and there is very little fragrance. Not so with this one. Granted buying is bulk supplies enough to last for a very long time, but I put small amounts in jars for daily use and freeze the rest. Freezing keeps the spice fresh for much longer, and buying in bulk is much more economical. In addition, the quality of spices from Frontier is so much better than anything you can buy in the store.

If you like blueberries, this tea is absolutely the best blueberry flavored herbal tea on the market.  I have tried bigelow which I thought would be exceptional but to my dismal no intense blueberry flavor, had more citrus (lemongrass or lemon) flavor.  However Celestrial Seasonings brand is so TRUE blueberry as if you are sipping on fresh blueberries.  I add a bit of maple syrup to it and it's sheer heaven. Sad part is that True Blueberry is not available locally however all the other flavors are.  What I have been doing is buying the sampler box which has only has 4 bags of blueberry and throwing the rest of the assorted tea away.  I know a waste of $$$ but I love the True Blueberry .  So glad Amazon sells True Blueberry~!!  THANKS! :o)
SCRUB: I blend few different oils and spices together to get the right mix for my skin. I blend EVCO, EVOO, avocado, raw honey, turmeric, coffee, germ wheat oil, almond oil, castor oil and ginger. Avocado and germ wheat oils high in vitamin E soften skin, castor oil removes black spots on the skin, EVOO is a hydrator and antioxidant, EVCO and raw honey are antibacterial, coffee exfoliates and tightens loose skin, turmeric reduces inflammation and ginger fight illness. I mix and add few drops of cold boiled water as needed a drop at a time till the mix forms a paste. I spread the mix over my skin and rub. I let it dry and rinse off in the shower. Afterward I apply almond, EVOO and EVCO.
5679	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This is really excellent honey. I like to make sure I always have it stocked. It's a smooth, spreadable honey with a really nice mild flavor. If you like a stronger honey flavor, you may find this too mild; however, it has a good flavor and goes well with anything you may want to use honey for. We love to spread it on toast; and I love to use it in my iced tea. The main negative is that they are constantly raising the price of their products, so...I'm not sure I will be hanging on for much longer as a loyal customer if I can find a replacement at a better price. This comes in a glass jar, which I really appreciate.

A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different. As stated above, they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare. I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags. I wondered how they could do this. What I got before was 5 flavors, 4 tea bags each. Yes, 5 times 4 = 20. How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags? Well, I found out today when I received the package, the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags, being two of the better flavors, Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion. Doh!

In other words if you are trying to make a mac n' cheese with a familiar tasting cheesy sauce (yes, I'm looking at you Kraft!) but want to use your own noodles, this is a fantastic product.

8174	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is awesome, awesome tea.  Does not taste like coffee - though I can see how it has a sort of grain-based civil-war coffee stand in appeal to it.  My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea was Almond Sunset which they discontinued - it was AWESOME.  This tastes someone what Almond Sunset, but without the amaretto tones.  I am scared they will discontinue this, though my husband is convinced that will never happen.  I think I may buy a few cases just in case.

I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce, several times a day usually. It comes in regular and extra hot. I have tried both and prefer the extra hot, although it is not that hot.

Sure, I know more than the average bear about salt. I read a book on it, and have tried some of the fine salts, smoked salts, and I have coarse chunks of pink Himalayan salt in a grinder on my table (they look great).

7238	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product for years and would be lost without it.  It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock, but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes, rice, etc.  It is very handy for the "flu" season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup.  For those times, I make a cup of chicken broth using this product.  Sometimes, I add leftovers from the fridge... rice, vegies, chicken.  The other flavors are also very handy... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire.

5871	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I have purchased this Raw honey from local merchants and on Amazon. It seems to be one of the better RAW HONEY varieties on the market today. Have been using this product for several months and it seems to be a very good product. Have tried other brands but this brand seems to be better than most I have tried, will continue to use it.
Could be especially nice in cool weather to sip this.

We raise chickens so I bake with our fresh eggs and it would seem a shame not to use the highest quality ingredients in my baking. This product ranks up there with the best.  I was glad to find this HUGE bottle too - great value!
Summary - A solid 5 star tea, This tea is possibly the best tea I have ever had, I would precaution you that I do like my items on the sweeter side, and this had the sweetness naturally (read above on Luo Han Guo). Some of you may find this too sweet or "fake" sweet, it appears the sweeteners are natural though from my limited research.
7651	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	If orange and spice flavors are your thing, then this is the herbal tea for you. The plus for me is that there is no star anise in it, which I'm not fond of but is in a lot of spice teas. The flavors in this are well balanced (e.g., the hibiscus doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients), and the aroma of the tea delightful -- a happy, cheerful cuppa. In addition, I emailed the company to find out if the soy lecithin they use is from GMO soy (which is pretty much in everything these days) and they said they use NO GMO soy or other GMO products in their teas -- something I value highly!

OF course, the proof is in the taste, and Boylan delivers here too. While it has a moderate head of foam, the taste is dryer than the more popular root beers, and seems more authentic.  Another reviewer commented on the cane sugar sweetening, which also imparts a less syrupy taste and texture than corn syrup; I concur.

You need to experiment with the amount you use for the amount of heat you want.  I use a heaping table spoon (silverware, not a measuring spoon) of the curry paste for one standard size can of coconut milk, and about a pound of meat or shrimp.  It's hot, but not crazy hot.  I tried 2 heaping tbl spoons the last batch, and it was way too hot for me.

It's ground pepper. It dispenses wonderfully.  It tastes good on hamburgers, eggs, potatoes and many other thing.
Regardless of whether or not you buy this salt, try tasting a standard table salt next to a sea salt.  The iodine and anti-caking agents have a distinct and unpleasant bitterness.  If you're not willing to get spendy on sea salt, at least find a salt with no additives, something like Diamond Crystal Kosher salt.

I'm using Pure Via at the moment, and while its the closest taste to the real thing, it still has an after taste.  I decided to really go natural, and after reading all the positive reviews from hundreds of reviewers, I took a chance and ordered the 2 pound jar ( I'm an all or nothing kind of man)

Dave's insanity products are called insane for good reason, they take hot up a dozen notches to thermonuclear! This sauce could easily have adopted the old Brylcream slogan "a little dab'll do ya" cause this stuff you use one small drop at a time. Just a few drops in a quart of tomato sauce and it was too hot for several of my friends. So heed the warning about the heat. However, if you are a true lover of hell's wrath in your body, this is the stuff! Incredible heat, but it also has a great taste. If you are not faint of heart, give this a try!
9827	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Excellent yeast, very active and fresh. Has a very pleasant fresh smell and taste, more similar to Red Star than Fleischmans but a good bit better than either one. Dissolves very quickly and couldn't really be any better in my opinion. Good price too!

4009	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	We like this seasoning.  We add it to our cooked meals on vegetables, rice, into soups and stews.  We also use it on grilled ribs as a dry rub. We love to put the ribs on the top shelf of our infrared grill and slow roast them without any sauces until they are golden brown and tender.  This spice is one of the things that makes the ribs just taste perfect.  We also like to use it as a seasoning for different meats used in tacos, soft tacos and burritos.  It adds the zest of lime into the flavor and a very small hint of spice and salt.  It works great with pork, beef, chicken and fish along with vegetables and fruit.

Oh, boy! A nice heat. After finishing my dish, there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth. The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish, but actually added an additional element. In addition, my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running. But a small price to pay!
7971	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is a perfect anytime refresher. Just put some bags into cold water, let steep for a couple hours and pour over ice and you've got a perfect accompaniment for something off the grill or all by itself.

If you are not careful, a good glop of sauce will pour out onto your food. DO NOT EAT THAT LAYER OF FOOD. Anything more than a drop at a time is too much. I made the mistake of eating half a glop an hour ago. My lips are still numb, I am still sweating, my insides are not happy, and I am dreading the trip to the bathroom tomorrow morning.

Overall, I'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes, as well as grilled meats, starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to, say, garlicky green veggie side dishes. Also, it's unlikely that I'll be able to sit down without searing pain for at least a month. So 'use in moderation' is the take-home message, I suppose.

With the roasted chicory and carob, this drink has a lot of the full, robust flavor of a hot mocha drink--but without the caffeine. The cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg give it a warm, spicy glow; while black pepper adds an unexpected zing.

It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:

Shipping was very fast, and I would recommend that if you cannot find sassasrass, I highly reccomend this others.

The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, red in color. I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.

7952	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I usually make a strong cup of tea with lemon, ginger, and honey for our head colds (it seems to help with congestion and speed up healing). This had almost everything in one place. I brewed him up a cup added the honey and afterward he didn't know it wasn't moms regular brew. He couldn't really taste it either so I had some too. There is a strong ginger taste but since I use this formula for colds I want a strong ginger taste. I enjoyed this tea and will continue to. I like that I won't have to run out and get some ginger if I have this on hand.
8135	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I really like this tea I was looking for a Chai Tea that I could drink all the time and ran up on this. Although it tastes nothing like Chai Tea I like this much better it has the taste of something like red hot candies and since that is one of my favorite candies this fits the bill for me. It may take some getting used to for some people I put a little sugar and milk in mine and it's perfect for me I don't know if it's a popular tea with people it does have a unique taste.

It's a pretty potent and i like my tea strong. I make about 4 cups at a time but only need to use 3 tea bags. Honey is the best sweetener - it mellows out the ginger a bit. It's great for nausea, especially when iced. It's excellent later in the day if you want a stimulating drink without any caffeine that may keep you up at night.
7854	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Refreshing combinations to consume, especially in winter. Even the aroma of the tea, sends an awesome feeling to your brain and hence is very therapeutic. No sugar seems to be required as the sweetness of the ingredients come through, when the tea has steeped well enough. However if you feel the need for a little sweetness, I'd recommend organic wild flower honey or Agave nectar. Although a bit tart, my personal favorite is the wild berry. A good buy for the price. Enjoy your tea otherwise.

I tried it once. The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard. The texture was gritty, and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn. The color is more intense than the flavor. I didn't find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imagined.

Some liked it hot so I added a tblsn+ or - red pepper flakes per pound. Make 5 pounds or more each time. Do not run this through a mixer. Comes out hard and rubber like.

We boil potatoes in a large pot, drain water, pour on some Japanese rice wine vinegar, add some finely sliced onion, cover and let this sit for a while.  When it's cooled a bit, we add chopped hard boiled eggs, some salt and pepper, a bit of Frenches mustard, and Kewpie mayo.  We prefer the potatoes in our potato salad to be more creamy than chunky, so tend to cook the potatoes a bit longer and stir everything together adding more mayo til it's the consistency we like.  This way is similar to what one buys in Japan.  Kewpie mayo also makes great deviled eggs!

Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too.

I admit at first I found the flavor a little unusual, but I've come to love it and the flavoring is all quite natural which is nice. Just various fruits and whatnot. The big thing for me was the no caffeine though. I love iced tea but brewing pitchers of iced tea every day and then waiting for them to cool was a hassle so it was great when cool brew tea first came out back in the day, however, drinking a full pitcher every day( which I often do) could be an issue with all the caffeine, so finding this decaf flavor was perfect.

5047	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Nice clean product with no odd debris or suspect lumps. Color is a nice nut brown, slightly lighter color than the other brand I purchase, but consistent and with gold flecking. Product is dry and well protected in it's packaging; no odd or slightly off aroma. I had happened to run out and needed this, so I used it immediately in my gluten free flour blend. It gave a nicer more soft nutty flavor to the flower than my previous brand. We also add it to our breakfast oatmeal and the results were the same. A soft nutty flavor, not overpowering. The grind is fine enough that there were no clumping issues in the oatmeal or flour blend. Some brands I've tried have almost an oily feel to them, this one did not, a good indication of proper processing.

9701	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	D&G Ginger beer has been the worst of the many Ginger beers I have tasted. It is way too sweet, it is just like a mouth full of sugar. The Ginger flavor is faint, and there is a slight spice as the sweetness faids. Standard super market Ginger Ale is light years better than this, and I don't consider super market ginger ale to be included in my top 10 Ginger beers. This would not fall anywhere in my top 10, but it made it into the Ginger beer pocket guide.  That's when I discovered how useless the pocket guide actually was. One of my favorites is Fentimanes. I describe Fentimans as a tiny bit dry, a bit sweet, and a nice spicy bite that won't choke you, but will make your mouth tingle. It is very refeshing, and a great mixer for Dark  and Stormy's.

Serving suggestions: This herbal tea is delightfully when consumed warm, or when poured over ice. Drink by itself, or sweeten with sugar or honey, or splash with milk, creamer, almond milk, rice drink, or coconut milk, to add an additional depth to this already fully flavored tea.

To me they are by the far best lemon, they pair well with many cocktails and foods (including salads!). They are more on the sweeter side compared to regular lemons, so don't confuse them for a "lemon lemon". I pop one or two slices into ginger ale and it complete changes the flavor to a more complex tropical flavor.

What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.
5912	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.  My first try at Rooibos so I don't have anything to directly compare it to.  Generally speaking, for an herbal tea, the color was a nice dark red, the flavor was mild and on the weak side.  Based on what I have read about Rooibos I expected more flavor.  I'll try making it stronger next time or letting it steep or brew longer.  Seems like a good value and at this price you could double up the strength.
3544	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Very disappointing, taste is bitter and harsh, with some foreign to coffee notes.  I was hoping for a mild to medium strength coffee, this is a dark roast.

This caviar has a nice little pop, doesn't smell and is not too salty (and I'm fairly sensitive to salt).  I also haven't had a problem with the coloring that others have commented on.  Keep in mind, with respect to taste,  I've never had caviar from the Caspian Sea (as far as I know).  Also, the jar I received states that this is a product from Iceland.

Very tiny kernels that only 1/2 pop & very little product when finished. This is NOT HULLLESS ( but maybe no popcorn truly is) This popcorn made my mouth so sore I couldn't eat for 2 dys & gave me terrible tummy upset--which I had to go to Dr. about.

Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It's sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh.

As a regular hot tea drinker, the economics involved in drinking prepackaged teas are an important consideration for me. As a result, I try to get 2 servings out of each tea bag whenever possible. For this variety, I can get 2 decent sized servings out of each bag though the second serving is a little diluted. It is still a good cup of tea. Celestial Seasonings tea bags do not come equipped with a string due to environmental considerations and to ensure that nothing compromises the flavor of the tea (like a metal staple on a tag).

Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

3107	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Ok heres the deal.  1 pea-sized drop will have ur mouth burning for about a half hour.  It's an "extract" sauce, it says it in the ingredients.  Which means the Capsaicin (the "Hot" compound) has been refined over and over again to produce the extreme heat.  It might be considered cheating, and I'm thinking this is probably what caused it to be kicked out of the National Fiery foods Contest.  The 1 problem here is that if your looking for flavor, you cant get enough of it because you can only use a little portion.  It's great to spice up weaker sauces.  Use it as an additive.

This tea taste like your basic black tea to me so I sweetened it with honey and sometimes add a spoonful of coconut oil just to get some healthy fat and lactic acid which I heard can help aid in the production of breastmilk. Now that I am 35 weeks I drink this tea 2 times a day and will sometimes switch off between this and the TM Pregnancy tea .

3182	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.

The pyramid shaped flaky crystals can be sprinkled on for light as air like salt crunch or broken between the fingers as it gets sprinkled on anything and everything. Grilled veggies never had it so good. Salted Caramel is beyond luscious with this added in. I use this in place of most salt in my cooking even tough I have about ten vials of various salts ranging from Grey Hawaiian Lava, Pink Himalayan, Bamboo Jade, Hawaiian Red Alaea to a Black course grind  ( great with lemonade) on my counter, I cook a lot so I go a bit nuts with this stuff. This is worth the buck and lasts a while, I say try it once then see how you feel about it, I use this as my daily basic cooking salt but it's really so much more as the taste and texture surpasses anything else salt related that I have ever bought.

The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety, and they're definitely moist with a 'fresh baked' look, feel, and taste to them.  When not on sale I think they're rather expensive, but for the price I paid (25% off regular price) I think they were worth it.  My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip; not a single one of our kids noticed it, and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies.  A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message.  So, if you're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you're sending them on your own as they most likely won't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies.

Recently, my body developed a bladder infection *on the day we were snowed in (for 3 weeks, it turned out)* - wouldn't you just know it! I couldn't have gotten to the pharmacy even if the doctor HAD prescribed an anti-biotic (which I don't like to take unless I absolutely have to). So I started drinking cranberry juice sweetened-to-taste with xylitol, and added coloidal silver as an antibiotic..  It seemed to have worked, but just to be sure, I had my doctor give me the "pee in a cup" test when I saw her (as soon as we could get down the mountain).

Salt, too, is evident in the flavor profile. However, the sodium content is still a manageable 50mg per tablespoon serving. The tomatoes add a little acidity, but also flavor that is augmented and enhanced by onion and spices. Combined, this is a rich and thick sauce with a lot of flavor.

8199	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Either Celestial Seasonings simply forgot to update amazon.com, or else it's a deliberate omission on the part of Celestial Seasonings, but you should be aware that soy lecithin is an unlisted ingredient in this blueberry tea. It's also in all the "Zinger" teas I've checked in local stores and in other Celestial Seasonings teas as well. But it's not listed here on amazon.com in the "ingredients" section. I phoned the company last spring when I first noticed this "adulteration" because I couldn't imagine why anyone would add soy lecithin to tea! I've nothing against soy lecithin. Sometimes I add it to yoghurt, but that's my own choice. Also, the source should be organic (or from a reliable supplier like Lewis Labs), since non-organic soy is almost always genetically modified.

I have been looking for something clearer and cleaner than what has typically been available in the local grocery. After reading the description of Clear Jel I was tempted to forego this one. I am glad I didn't. This product is a modified corn-starch. What does 'modified' mean?? I don't know. And truth told, I don't really care too much. The real questions that need to be answered are, "Does it do what it is supposed to do?", "Does it do it better than a different, readily available product?" and "Is it a cost-effective alternative?" With those questions in mind, I made the purchase and have now done some testing.

1798	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I am not a cheese expert nor do I claim to be one so this kind of cheese is new to me.  If you are not used to this kind of cheese you might have the same reaction I did and I guess since I am usually getting cheese that's found in the supermarket (like slices of Kraft cheese or a block of cheese) I found this cheese to be an acquired taste.  At 1st I thought the cheese was awful but than I thought about it and the main reason I thought that was since I am not used to the taste it might not be pleasing at 1st.  So I gave it a chance and over a few minutes I had found it to be great tasting and I wanted more and its the same way when someone eats it with me.  Even though when I let someone else taste this cheese they usually have the same reaction I had when I ate it the 1st time and I understand why, so I explain why it probably doesn't cater to their taste.  I have found its taste is still not for everyone so that's why I figure its more acquired if you are used to something else.  I have found any of the cheeses that came to be relatively strong tasting and always leaveing an aftertaste and that is not always a bad thing.  It was a nice way to taste the way different cheeses from different places vary.  Now that I have the taste for gourmet cheese and its grown on me quite a bit I don't know if I can go back to normal supermarket cheese anymore.

If you choose to use this product In an airbrush machine, be aware that it may clog your needle if it's a small one. I premixed my dust with extract/vodka and put it into a squeeze bottle. This works pretty well because you can shake and mix the dust up each time you want to put some in the airbrush cup.

6585	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I don't care for the taste, but I like how it makes me feel. It's not sweet, (I love sweet teas!) but if you add a dash of honey, it's a lovely taste. It's very soothing.
2333	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Great Product. Will buy again
474	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	While you're chewing it, everything's great. It's fresh, it feels good, and you wish it could go on like that forever. Then it reaches a point where it loses it's appeal completely and you spit it out in disgust, hoping to never, EVER see it again, discarding it like a used up tissue.

2623	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	The enjoyment starts when you take the cellophane wrapper off the box. The smell is tantalizing. I got this yesterday, and I've already enjoyed three cups of this delicious tea. Perfect for Fall.
8629	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	So happy that I purchased this from Frontier.  It is so fresh and aromatic like all of Frontiers spices.  A little goes a long way so this will last me for quite a while.  Thanks Frontier!

3380	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I really was skeptical about this product when I first purchased it. After ordering it several times already I am convinced that this is a great product. I have always used natural vanilla extracts but this powder comes mighty close to realizing the flavor of vanilla beans.

But moisture alone does not make a good energy bar. The Fruit Smoothie PowerBar isn't bad per se, but it is not very good. It is sweet, but it doesn't really taste much like a fruit smoothie, especially not a smoothie from the likes of Jamba Juice. It is just kinda of sweet and pliable.
8926	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love both the texture and the taste of this salt. These big, crunchy flakes are perfect to sprinkle over a meal to finish it before serving. To me, this has just a nice, 'clear' salt flavor.
7009	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have ordered this many times. Mixed with organic green and white tea, it's the best cold summer drink. In the winter I use it hot. Deep cinnamon flavor and much better price than the grocery store.
Thanks
