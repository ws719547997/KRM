9502	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This tool works on a 98 Acura TL 2.5. I was able to break the pulley bolt free with this attached to a breaker bar and a 19mm impact socket with a breaker bar.
My car is 9 years old, and this was the first time restoring the headlights, and I was almost amazed how this stuff gets all that blur right out and makes them look almost new again.
5. No more spilling Oil from a Drain Pan when cautiously sliding it out from under the Car.
170	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Just as I thought...it tells you how to rebuild the transmission, differential and engine (who is going to do that??) it does not tell you how to do some of the things you are actually going to attempt in your garage.
3487	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Neat little lock. On and seems to be fine, I did bent the backplate slightly to tighten up the shackle slop, but it works as advertised

7302	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought one, and came back to buy two more in different colors.  Fantastic product.
4081	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Straight forward, pic and description are accurate.  Great price compared to boat shop.  I have a loadmaster Aluminum boat trailer.  I am happy with this purchase.
2624	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a fairly large helmet bag, that's big enough to hold a full size helmet plus gloves, sunglasses, ear plugs, etc. Great for traveling, well padded to protect your lid from scratches, etc. The zipper closures work smoothly and the carrying handle is comfortable.
3567	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well to remove scratches on vanity tops, metal, etc.  Follow-up with their Faucet Waxx  PW02685, and the finish will resist water spots.
1183	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great oiler.  I have a half dozen Golden rod oilers scattered around the shop near machines that require oiling and they all work great. Allow me to place just the amount of lubricant I need exactly where I need it. Priced right too.  I'm sure I will be buying more of these.
2809	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I liked it so much for my car I got one for my van.

5992	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Does a nice job on cleaning and polishing the motorcycle windshield. However, for scratches in the windshield a scratch remover is necessary first.
3673	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff really does well on sunglasses and motorcycle helmet visors and ATV windshields. Helps eliminate those soft scratches and swirl marks.
3671	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Too bad it didn't fit my Jeep Wrangler spare tire but the company refunded my money with no questions asked.
490	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect replacements for our Power wheels, we needed a second one due to recent increased activity :)
4186	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for.  Compared to some other products I purchased which went on heavy and wet (and still haven't dried), this product sprayed evenly, lightly, and dried to a hard waxy compound, like the old school Cosmoline.
539	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love using this!! The only thing when you use it for the 1st time there will be a lot of lint that comes out, I'm not sure if any way around that....but after a few usage, it's good to go!!
740	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	As advertised...works well...perfect fit..no hastle
8212	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Just got it but quality seems good for the price.  It's easy to use & grips the sides of my bed liner very well.  So far I have used it to keep in place 5 gallon buckets of paint one day & a lawnmower another day.
5047	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The name really says it all. I keep this shammy in my trunk at all times. Just ring it out, roll it up, put it back in the tube and it is ready to go next time. Does not get moldy and it is machine washable.
8733	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It looks as there are more rubber in front compare to dexter one. It works as advertized and I will definitely buy again as the price is also reasonable.
1450	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This gauge seemed to be accurate and well built.  Worked very well for about a year.  Then the seal that mates with the valve stem became loose and distorted.  After that, the gauge went in the trash.
8265	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The boat police are happier with me now
5676	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Had lower expectations about this product due to the cost. It has surpassed my expectations and then some as I've been using it daily on my truck for many months without fail. My only suggestion would be to buy a locking pin as it looks cool and people may want to steal it.
4247	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works perfectly!!!

4101	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This Ngk spark plug was just the the thing I needed for my 4 wheeler. It came really fast and worked really good on my lt250r. Will definitely be buying more to keep as spares. The price was unbeatable.
Lake Country Pads are probably some of the best out there, a lot cheaper than this.
7456	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great Chamois, large size and very absorbent ...
6591	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent.
9926	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Too stiff. In fact there is a stiffener spine right behind the bulge. I end up buying a yoga pad for the purpose.
8570	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	must warm up oil to be able to suction out easier. this makes an oil change so much easier. I recommend this product for any do-it yourselfer.

7307	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It hold water and works well
771	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use this in my truck- does the job.

- Although it doesn't take continuous pumping and is actually not recommended, it requires repumping during the oil change. I suppose this is typical and is the only way to really do it. Scientifically speaking, it's the nature of the beast, so no complaints. It is what it is.
4533	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Makes drying off newly washed vehicles a breeze. Constantly using it on all of our cars in the family. Would recommend.
3170	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	EXCELLENT PRODUCT THE QUALITY PRODUCT I RECOMMEND WELL IN THE VEHICLE USED TO WINTER AND PREVENTS DUST RAYS OF SUN AND SERENE


2074	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you are like me an obsess over your motorcycle being clean and dust free just before a ride, this works great for a quick dust-off.

6401	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Less absorbent then I remembered in the past.  My previous chamois seemed to be easier to keep water spots off windows when drying.
324	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This book has pages like those in a phone book and the images are very hard to make out (all black and white). You could print this all out on your home printer from a digital copy and end up with better quality. Automotive repair manuals need to be able to stand up to dirt, grease and frequent handling. I'm not impressed with it at all. I'd like to see a mechanic under the hood of a car fumbling around with their Kindle, give me a break!
Cons:
The book is a little light on the front suspension and some of the optional equipment (i.e. cruise control, fog lights), but otherwise it hits the nail on the head.
4096	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	And for that reason, is why I always trust and use exclusively when I'm replacing the plugs in my boats.
I had a hairpin crack at on the bottom of my tank on the edge of a divot.  So tiny that it dripped maybe once every 5 minutes.  It was about 1/1000 mm wide and 1 mm long - so imagine the tiniest crack you can get.
5434	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertised. No complaints yet.
2930	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product for years on all sorts of clear plastics to seal after using the Meguiar's cleaner.
Just squeeze out the water, roll it back up, and put it in the original plastic container. Mine has never mildewed or gotten mold on it.
9315	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Dad needed it to fix his car. Worked as it was described.

It wants a cigarette lighter to plug into, so buy an adapter if you don't have one.
It will literally shoot off after a few depressions of the plunger.
2304	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	good
After several application of this product was amazed at all the greasy dirt coming out and now the look is not only show room new but the feeling of freshness and comfort can be finally be enjoyed. You don't seat anymore on filth but on a crisp finish. I am waiting for No. 40 to arrive since that is recomended as the next step.
2824	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Best price around. Simple to use and being clear you can see what's being filtered. Keep a spare filter handy, when it needs to be changed you'll know by the flow going way down.
2054	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	perfect size!
I read the reviews about leaking and debated over this. However, I saw someone who tried windshield washing fluid cap and it worked for him. I thought it was enough for me to bite, as the top lid doesn't have to be tight as long as I transport the thing horizontally to the nearest recycling center. I got it from a local big box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than Amazon, and that I wanted to see it first.
7086	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So far so good. Well built. Looks like il get hopefully many years of use out of this fan. Reasonably quiet.

4970	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The absorber works Great for drying my truck after washing!
The top grid is handy for catching the oil plugs so they don't go down into the oil... and setting the oil filter on to drain.

389	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Cons:
6965	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	lots of elbow grease required...but...the results are worth the effort...  my boat is in a shed and the birds do their business  while roosting...  meguiars removed all the poop stains and once waxed, the poop washed off without any effort without leaving a stain...  the oxidizer remover works great...i can feel the roughness disappear while rubbing the liquid in...that's how i know the oxidizer process is completed...  once the oxidation process is completed...the polishing and waxing go fast...rub on and wipe off...  btw...buy the restoration 3 bottle kit...cheaper than buying individual bottles...  they're all 16oz...

9222	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What a great product.  We use it in our golf cart, perfect!
3712	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These switches match the On-Off-On nav light switch in my 2014 Boston Whaler. I was adding electronics and bilge pump to the Whaler and needed more switches. Originally had planned on replacing nav switch and replacing all with toggles. However, the panel was FAR too thick for toggles to work without cutting a large hole and putting a switch panel in which I did not wish to do.

3908	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is very handy for adding Sea Foam to your gas tank especially with the raised back. It seems very durable and likely will not ever need replacing.
434	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Looks good
3177	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	though rain goes right through it.  When the tree pollen hits it and then rain, the pollen will sorta seem through and leave some marks on the truck.  Not great, but better than the huge amount of needles I would have otherwise gotten.  So I am happy. Also the cover will not pack down easily into the bag provided. So plan on someting for that if you have a need.  otherwise, it fit nice on the tundra (with canopy) and looked good. never came off in wind.

4037	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got this for my 2500 and it looks really nice. The face seems high quality but the tube feels a little cheap. Not too worried about it since I won't be taking it into battle or anything.

One additional note - the manual and web site quote the power consumption of the P-20 at 4A / 48W.  I measured it at 4.5A / 54W.
7135	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This fan rocks and only draws three amps per hour on it's highest speed. There really is no better alternative available, I recommend it highly.
1234	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great bottle. Hasn't leaked yet. Shoots liquids, thick or thin.
4214	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works really well but does leave a yellowish film behind. If you use this in an area out of view, or don't care about that, it works great to protect your metal. My boat trailer loves the staff!

978	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I admit that I purchased the mower used, and though the previous owner did seem to take great care of the mower, I did find that there was simply a standard resistor plug in use. The installation of this new plug has made a noticeable difference (whether caused simply by the use of a new plug, or the fact that this plug is of a different design). Whatever the case for the improved operation, I do approve of the results of this new plug.

It fits the cars and SUV s that it says it does.
I tried lightly rubbing on a  painted roof of a 70's Nylint  Pick upTruck I got on Ebay and it took off some lite scuff marks, but there was a small trace of red paint residue on the rag after I applied the plastX to the paint. It doesn't appear to be any paint rubbed off the truck, so it might have been oxidation on the rag? The bottle says not for painted surfaces, but this paint on the truck was 41 years old.

1495	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I received this from the seller (Midway) within TWO DAYS after ordering - fantastic.  It came fully charged out of the box and so far - so good, though I have not really put it to the test yet.  I may add a couple of deep cycle batteries on top of this powerpack to give it more juice so stay tuned.
8049	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Keeps stuff in the bed of the truck at the tailgate.
7870	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	first, i chose this gauge because of the simple clean face and the size did eventually fit my off-design use.  most others give you the fractions on the face which i perceive as extra clutter.
I highly recommend them for those needing low cost storage type protection from scuffs and scratches.
4737	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I am car-sitting a vehicle that mostly sits in my garage.  I don't drive it nearly enough to keep the battery charged.  I am also convinced that Fords have a damn trickle as this car drains a battery faster than anything else I have seen [maybe not as fast as a snooty BMW].  I spent a hoop of time looking on line for a quality product.  This one was well reviewed on many forums and after going to the factory web page I was convinced.  Amazon had the BEST price period.  I ordered four to start, one for Dad [has a truck he rarely drives], one for car I "baby-sit", one of wife's Jeep it sometimes does not get driven for days which is only a concern during cold Illinois winters, and my truck which always is outside [does not fit in garage] and thought it would be a good idea on those super cold nights when I also plug in my battery blanket and oil heater.
7479	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This 4 wire harness is easy to install and includes a separate brown wire for each right and left light. (Most harnesses only have one wire and require a splice to connect to the second light.) At 25 feet, it is plenty long for almost any trailer. A real time saver!
3272	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fine
I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.

1850	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works nicely and saves me from having to wash the car so frequently.
3388	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I haven't actually opened this box and applied yet. Hope it hasn't changed because it worked awesome. I had a truck when I was in my 20s and the wiper motor died. No windshield wipers at all. Drove around like that for about 6 months thru spring and summer. With Rain X on my windshield I was able to get away with it for awhile. Rain just beads up and runs off, and hard rain actually ricocheted off and I could see fine. The key is to really clean your windshield before applying. Lasts a pretty long time too if I remember correctly. Obviously not a substitute for wipers, but in certain conditions you will be tempted to leave them off it works so good.
4007	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	OK, what can you say about a funnel?  Filler holes on most bikes are not really easy to access without spilling oil, but this funnel makes it very easy.  Great product, and highly recommend.

Apply it 3 times each time wipe it for 40 sec. N wipe it good you will see results after secon wipe  3rd wipe leave the polish on headlight leave it for 30 sec for good results then clean it off. At the end pour some water n with a dry rag or cloth  wipe your headlight till ita dry and shinny. Good luck everyone

758	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Motor worked great, was as quite as you would expect a fan to be. I did have a issue in that the shaft length was 3/4 of an inch shorter and the blade wanted to hit the mount. fortunately my setup used a band mount and I was able to move the motor further inward with slight modification to the mount. Very pleased if only I hadn't tried to be cheap and get the longer shaft to start with it would have been a direct replacement.
7707	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Are you serious?  It turns stiff as cardboard when it dries.  I purchased this to dry my camera gear when it was raining and took it out of the container so I could store it in my backpack.  Low and behold, it dried up like cardboard.  Then I found out you have to keep it in that thing, and it was coated with some alcohol like chemical, which I am sure is not good for my gear.

9527	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I wish I could only have bought one of these, but they were only sold in pairs so now I have a backup.  The hubs are easy to put on, except they take 2 special axle nuts per axle.  Each round nut has 4 slots and needs a special tool to tighten (torque).  I had zero luck trying to find rebuild kits for this hub.  If they exist they might have been cheaper.  The last hub I had got ruined from loose axle nuts.

1427	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I will say that I am surprised that such a well built product is being manufactured in the U.S.!  I figured with all the tax breaks to outsource everything, companies would be foolish to do that...but I am glad to see that DAE is not worried about those types of things!  They appear to be more focused on building a relatively nice creeper!  This thing is comfortable, sturdy, easy to maneuver, and can roll over just about anything!  Required minor installation of the casters, but that became an activity that my four year old could do!
6791	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected
As for the product itself, I don't like the plastic construction and wish it was better sealed from the elements. I wish it was all metal except the red plastic cover, and wish it came with a quality LED bulb like I bought, with an option to add a hitch lock and/or power adapter to this product and maybe this would be a 5 star product. Other than that, it fits and it works, but I haven't had it long. Hopefully with the upgrades I've done to it, it will improve its visibility.

I had Blackstone Laboratories perform a used oil analysis on the oil at 8,300 miles.  The oil still had plenty of life left in it and the Insoluables rating was at 0.3% (normal is below 0.6%), indicating to me that this filter is doing its job.

Second, the design of the top of the pen has changed slightly. As can be seen in my pictures, the older Picopen had a tiny lip at the top of the pen, where it connected with the cap. The newer design is a smooth cylinder.

2504	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Haven't had any issues with this, and looks to be a solid piece.  Worked well in the rain and such with no rust to report.
I've been putting polyurethane on this what I believe is eucalyptus wood. I'm fed up with it not lasting so I gave oil a try. I sanded my table down and put this on. Pictures attached are bare wood on right and oiled one left and other picture is fully complete with only 2 light coats. Will add another coat the following day. Thus far it's looking great and "wood" recommended.

Starbrite Tropical Teak Oil Natural Light which sealed and oiled up the wood real good. i have a review of that as well.

8147	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My original cargo bar had enough...and finally broke, and in the last couple of years was very difficult to use. Although, it was a different brand. I replaced it with this, and I could not be happier. Works great and seems very reliable!

2267	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this to remove a scratch in my wife's car. I decided to try it first on a smaller scratch on mine. No luck. I figured maybe I didn't apply enough compound (this is my first time trying it). With a giant gob, again, no luck. After wiping it clean and coming back a few days later, it looks the same. I decided to apply a second coat with a generous helping. Sadly, it still looks the same as before.
4685	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased a used tonneau cover for my car.  The cover appeared pretty dingy with dirt rubbed in patches all over.

8777	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this shield to keep rain and snow out of my face while traveling between camp and hunting locations.  It fit easily onto my helmet.  I had a bit of fogging, but when it's really cold out, that's not too surprising.  As the title suggests, I'm satisfied.

2088	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have a son who smokes cigarettes.  I really wish that he didn't, but he is old enough (30+) to make his own choices.  He always smokes outside and his deck gets littered with butts until he decides to sweep them up.  I decided to get him an ashtray that would work outside.  As usual, I started my search on Amazon and came up with the Blomus 12cm cover ashtray.
4825	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great absorption and wrings completely dry very easily. I bought three additional units after I tried it once.
1622	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Much better than any other duster.  Have used others and they just don't seem to be as effective as this one.
The last vehicle I used this on was an Mazda truck from the 80's. Being an older truck, it let the engine idle for about 20-25 minutes before I used the oil extractor. After that, it took all the oil out within about 30 minutes.
4529	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does what it supposed to do and has always done it without any failure or any other problem with filter.  The drip material on the filter really helps to get it properly tight when installing new filter.  Some folks talk down about Fram, but for the money and the quality I have seen, it's still a great choice over other filters.
The only other option is to pour the chemicals in graduated cups to get the right mixture, but this is not as practical if you are mixing several small batches.
Since this cooler uses the same cooling unit as the larger ones it cools very quickly and the temperature is right above freezing. I bet if you filled it with ice and plugged it in, the ice would all still be there a month later.
Do you have to have a polisher? No because hand rubbing will do a nice job. Polishers have the capability of giving you higher gloss, and deeper depth of fresh glass for better colors. Some people fine paper older glass using wet or dry paper like 1,000 grit, and then use compounds to remove the fine scratches. My philosophy is don't go deeper than you need to.
4219	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff works great on cars.  Sticks well and stays put when it dries.  I sprayed it on the brake lines on my 2000 Honda Accord that have surface rust.  A little squirt now will save a lot of pain and expense later!  Sprayed this stuff on them in the fall and it stood up to the winter well.

2041	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The duster is as pictured, small, compact and easy to store. The threads on this product feels that it has wax. Upon impart on a dusty surface, it will lift up the dirt as you motion it side to side. After use, the surface show no scratches. This product was used on an automobile several times and till this time proves to be gentle to the surface vehicle, works exactly as well as its larger verson. Because of its size, it is recommended to use on dash surfaces in the car or any surface you desire.

8601	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is so easy I wish I had it 40 yrs ago. No more mess from drain plugs and spills. Very easy to use. I changed the oil in all 5 of my mowers in about 30 minutes.
I did some chemical research and discovered that plastic oxidizes, and that's what the yellow coating is on the old headlights. So a deoxidizer was required. This contained an oxide, so I wasn't sure it work. But lo and behold, it did. Now, it didn't make them perfect again, but it did pretty dang well. It's a cleaner plus polisher, so it will protect your headlights from oxidation for a while.

3984	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got sick of using my "Common" funnel for different uses, trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for Sea Foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than $1.  The size/length is perfect for gas-tank additives.  I purchased 3, I keep one in the garage to pour Sea Foam into my cara/motorcycle/snow-blower/lawnmower.  And the other 2 I keep in whatever vehicle I'm currently using, in my "just in case" pack.

3669	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't feel safe leaving my trailer until I got this lock.  t was a little sloppy, leaving a small gap on the side - so with it locked, I took a bar and bent it to close that gap.  Probably more cosmetic but it looks more secure.

7745	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product PURELY on ratings. It paid off this time because this thing is awesome. I wash my cars a lot in the spring and summer, I go through one chamois per season. I normally like the lamb skin ones because I feel they are the most absorbent and don't leave streaks. The old chamois made of cloth start piling over time and lint on the car. Years ago all of the synthetic chamois were so crappy, they weren't that absorbent, they left streaks or smelled bad. This thing is awesome and its big so very absorbent, it holds a lot of water before you have to wring it out. I am very happy with it so far, I've used it for two washes already. Glad i found this.
3285	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered two and I got charged for 2 and I only received one. I have not used it because I still need to buy another one.

6029	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	2 thumbs up! Went out and placed one on my trailer 4wire lead and it fit perfect. Would buy again
5078	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I cannot rave about this chamois enough!!!!  I had gotten a sham-wow before and was disappointed in it.  I had gotten it to help dry my car off and purchased this one for the exact same purpose.  It works fantastic!  I really will be buying more for all sorts of house-work.

6563	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Came broken. No protection inside the box. I would expect more for a $70 fan.
3642	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A bit smaller than I expected but it does the job well for making it easier to put gas in the car since the wonderful gas cans don't have a long enough nozzle. Although it is on the small side, it's narrow design allows for it to fit in to a small space under the hood. Very sturdy construction.
4029	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just the right size and shape for loading oil into my snow blower.  There is only so much you can say about a funnel but it works very well for the task at hand.
The three attached scope traces show the waveform at idle, at 750w resistive load, and finally at 1750 watts resistive load. This inverter did run for several minutes at 1750 watts during test without issue and without overloading, though the waveform nearly approached a square wave at that output level (see scope traces). It appears to be a very robust design, and is about half the size of the 2000w Tripp lite inverter I also own, and 1/3 of the weight.
9955	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is the 2nd TrashStand that I have bought for 2 of my cars.  I really like this trash can.  It is the right size, has the weighted bottom, the Velcro keeps it from sliding around on the carpet. One thing that would be nice is if you had the option to remove the lid from it.  I like the top open so all I do is tuck it down into the trash can - not a big deal in the end but would be nice if it was removable.  Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that the sides on ends (short way) do not have any support.  The long sides have an 1/8" board in them to make the sides rigid.  The short sides have nothing.  The first one I got I cut up the packing box and inserted those on short sides.  It works ok and over the long time the card board seems to be breaking down.  On the 2nd one I have cut a couple of pieces of 1/4" plywood to fit the sides.  This "modification" makes the unit much more rigid and stable.
Too small for my use and not UV protected.
2441	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	good price
5303	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Why I haven't been cleaning my bike or truck with this sooner, is besides me! I love this thing! It can take a little while to twist the water while your wiping, but once you rinse it out, boom its dry and ready to go. Leaves barely any to no streaks, and is just overall a must have for anyone who likes to wash their own vehicles or anything that needs to be washed for that matter. Already plan on buying probably two more of these things! Highly recommended!
7714	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have several of this, I use them for all sorts of things. They last for many years, I use them on job sites to keep cool, just dip it in cold water and instant cooling.


5912	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is amazing how well this product works in relation to headlight restoration. This will clean light to moderate hazing, but not severe damage. Follow the simple instructions and this will not take long. A fantastic in-between or initial product. What I am about to type is important in regards to any headlight restoration product on the market. Once you remove the factory headlight coating, wether it old or not, your headlights will require regular application. This pertains to any headlight restoration kit, compound, or product. Think carefully before you sand or apply a product. "Are my headlights really that bad or can this wait?" This one in particular is the equivalent of a gentle rubbing compound.
464	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my truck
8517	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The first time I used this, I thought it was a terrible product - it took me about 4 hours to suck all the oil out of the engine. However, after better  familiarizing myself with it, I now this it's great...IF you use it correctly. (You must, must, must let your vehicle adequately warm up before use.)
3593	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	nice wax for my rv AAAA++++
I tried sanding what I applied to the bathtub and it tore up the sandpaper I was using (I believe it was 120 grit) as well as a sanding sponge that I was using (I believe it was 100 grit).  The only thing that worked for me was the 40 grit sandpaper, but even that wore quickly.  I believe that I used too much hardener, as this stuff is tough!  Oh, and the holes I filled ranged from the size of a dime to just over the size of a nickle.  Due to the thickness of the product, I was able to use it as a filler without any support underneath it and now those holes are as solid as the rest of the tub.  Very impressive product and now I'm looking for other projects to use it with!

4316	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I now have 4 of these, one of which has been running 24/7 for about 7 months now. On the first 2 units I purchased, I set up digital meters to watch volts and amps as they charged... the chargers appear to do what they are advertised to do.
34	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Not super strong but it does the job.
3774	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Second one I have and it works well. Keep one in a bag and one in the shop/garage.
BOTTOM LINE:
7052	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very hand item to have on board our RV.  12 volt operation means we can skip the inverter and be more efficient with our use of electricity.  Definitely does not move as much air as a 120 volt fan, but that's the penalty for the 12 volt capability.

9910	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	this fit very nicely into my stock air box and the best thing about it  was I will never have to buy a another air filter again.
5185	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good
Radio Shack indoor/outdoor thermometer is another great accessory.  We attach the thermometer to the outside of the cooler or car seat with double sided tape and run the wire  and probe to the inside of the cooler. This gives a reading for both car and cooler temperature.

I am truely amazed how effective and fast Mcguires PlastX made my headlamp lenses look like new again. And with no sanding disc, no buffing wheel, just the PlastX and a soft pad. They do recommend the polishing kit for badly hazed plastics but just the compound will work for mildly hazed ones. I wish I took before and after pics to share but I had little faith it would work, boy, was I wrong. Thanks Mcguires PlastX for saving me big $$$ and making my lenses look new again.
2983	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I returned it today using an awesome Amazon locker for the free shipping.  This was a replacement for an S-516 that also had to be returned to Amazon. I was looking for a commercial quality inflator with a gauge that was made in USA. It is heavy and looks great but the dual head air chuck just blows the air straight through it. I returned the one and really wanted this inflator so I ordered it again but both had the same faulty dual head chuck. Milton's people on top must have thought they could cut expenses with a cheaper gasket inside, probably a cheap fix.
7765	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works well. Just keep in mind that it is pretty much clear to clear/yellow. It does not come white, or neutral base color. this is fine if you're painting over it, but otherwise, you'll need tint.
8278	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Use this in my car. My mirror kept falling down. Tried glue, cleaned surface first, tried another glue and no matter what, it fell down. This one I stick up and just pull off until the next time I drive. Sticks really well.

5969	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I had fairly deep scratches on the stereo face in my car. I got this and inside of 5 minutes, they were gone!

1975	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing will clean your car in ten seconds. Works very, very well.
Due to only the mounting issues (attachments being too large circumference to fit typical battery lug nut) and the lack of an alligator clip attachment, I rate this 4-star. Other than that, for an inexpensive charger, this offers a lot and I wait to do my reviews for awhile so I can offer information on reliability which is important to me. This unit has been out in the weather, hooked up and removed probably 25-times, charged that many times, and is still working great.
I also use it on the U-bolts on my trailer and on the electrical fittings inside the lights. Wet lights continue to work and the salt water doesn't destroy the sockets. Spray the bulb connections too.

2469	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Well Three years, greased often and did not rust ,BUT, when I went to remove key would not align with lock. I had to work very hard to cut and chisel off. I belive it is the type of keys used in this lock. Would Not Buy Again.
1133	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised. Great price.
8608	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This made changing the oil on my car extremely easy.  It took about 20 minutes to fully extract the 5.5 quarts of oil but the fact that there is essentially no mess makes up for the time.  Highly recommended to make all oil changes easier.
4648	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Says after use to clean out soap from rag and then put away damp.  I've done that, smells a fair bit when you take it out to use again but gets the job done!
Otherwise, the VEC1093 charger appears to be as advertised and does a good job.  I would buy another if they ever redesigned the battery clamps.
As for fit, I'm 5'11" 185lbs.  I wear a medium in most clothing.  I wanted a suit that would fit over my clothes.  So I ordered a large.  A large on my frame fits over my jeans perfectly.  The rain coat fits perfectly over my leather jacket.  If I were to just wear the rain coat over my shirt, I would want a medium.  But because I always use my leather coat when riding, I needed a large size suit to go over my leather jacket.  The collar is the only snug part of the jacket.  It probably should be the only snug part anyway to keep rain from running down your neck.
3459	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This funnel is excellent quality and is built to last.
6436	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this behind my 1990 Mastercraft's rubrail.  The hull had seperated from the deck where the previous owner had bumped something and water was coming between the seam.  Also used it on all the rivet holes.  Mine took about a week to fully cure the first half of the boat that I did.  I kept the woodstove going in the shop to keep the temp up to aid in curing.  Later I read it actually cures with moisture as well as a good tempurature.  Since my wood stove/furnace actually dries the air out, I used a spray bottle and lightly spritzed water on it a couple of times a day.  Seemed to help cure the other half quicker.

4420	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Fram filters for over 30 years now and have never had a problem with their performance. Never a leak and after 3000-5000 miles every time my oil still has that clear (translucent) appearance. Really, the key to keeping your oil and engine clean is to faithfully change your oil regularly. I have two vehicles...one 1996 with 180,000 miles and the other 1964 with over 300,000 miles...where neither burns any oil between changes and continue to run smoothly.

1951	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've owned my Mini Duster for three years and find it is perfect for small places and tight spots. My only complaint is that the mop head fibers could be just a tiny bit longer. I believe if that were the case, it would perform better at lifting dust from areas that are like "fake" honeycomb (like in the attached picture.) The fibers on the standard are too thick for that type job. Otherwise, this is a superb product and I will be buying another very soon.
When I picked up this heated travel blanket a few months ago I hoped it would at least produce some heat. Living in northern Minnesota, it gets extremely cold and there is always a fight over the vehicle thermostat. Someone is always getting to warm from the heater while someone else is still too cold. On one trip I plugged in this blanket and couldn't believe how toasty warm it got! It warmed up just as hot and just as quickly as a household electric blanket does. I was thrilled and finally warm enough while in the car going places in the cold winter.
5526	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These dust covers are for four-pin flat trailer light connectors.  They do a good job of keeping dust, dirt, and moisture out of the vehicle-side terminal.  Two dust covers come in the package, along with a small measure of grease to help prevent corrosion.

8614	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	OK, so no faster than a normal oil change, but potentially much neater.  For small engines, you may need a third hand or rig some way of holding the extraction /sucking tube in the dip stick tube/ port.  If you have easy access to your oil filter, it's a no/low drip oil change. If the oil flow doesn't start when you pump, make sure you don't have the extraction tube in too far.
3432	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These switches match the On-Off-On nav light switch in my 2014 Boston Whaler. I was adding electronics and bilge pump to the Whaler and needed more switches. Originally had planned on replacing nav switch and replacing all with toggles. However, the panel was FAR too thick for toggles to work without cutting a large hole and putting a switch panel in which I did not wish to do.
On my other vehicle with the previous SE-1-12S version installed, if it is plugged in there is always an LED lit up, and i have watched it switch automatically between modes.
I like the hole they put on top so I can hang it on my rack for storage.

7718	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought my first Absorber in 1990 and still use it to this day. However, it has become frayed around the edges and has been relegated to cleaning dirtier parts like the wheels and exhaust. In 2006, I bought a new Absorber which I use to dry my sports car and my wife's SUV. However, I've noticed recently that the new Absorber is simply not soaking up the water like it used to. I even run it through the washer hoping that would revitalize its drying ability but it did not. That said, I'm going to buy a new one this weekend and hope it works better. Regardless, it's hard to fault the price of the Absorber and how long I've used it. For that reason, I won't use anything else to dry my cars!

4982	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I can't believe how well this absorbs water. I've always used a natural chamois and this totally blows them away. For drying flat surfaces (hood, trunk, roof) all you need to do is lay it down and lightly drag it across the surface. It picks up any moisture with no pressure at all. Be sure to wring it out frequently as it doesn't really feel wet, but will be filled with water and its effectiveness will decrease.

2185	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this for work travel.  It's a decent unit for what I need but the fan is extremely LOUD, and it will drain my truck battery too quickly to be the most useful for me.  Plus you need to run it almost 100% of the time to get decent cold out of it.  Once you stop running it for a while you loose the coolness and it takes forever to get it back.
1. Chrome plated. This means the metal it is made from is not corrosion resistant.

9930	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased a couple of these several years ago, and they installed easily while stopping the kids from taking the paint off the garage wall and our car doors.  I wanted to protect the other wall (and the other vehicle) from our grandkids, so I ordered here after searching in vain to get more of them locally.
5304	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used these for over 10 years as well as natural sheep skin chamois. This works very well. If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois. It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it). Then why use a natural chamois?  Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois. I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager. Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa)  I do recommend it. Hope this helps someone.

This is damn near the best creeper: low profile, sturdy, easy rolling, almost impossible to accidentally flip over (even when rolling your body onto the extreme edge).  I was torn between the original Bone with its larger wheels and supposed half-inch lower position of a persons' body, but complaints of the painfulness of resting on the molded logo embedded in the headrest and larger wheel housings that could interfere with movement and access, I went with the $20 cheaper Bone-ster and I'm relieved I wasn't disappointed with this selection.  And being slimmer takes up a bit less space when storing it in a nook.  I still need to keep an old cardboard box around for those rare times when I can't raise the vehicle high enough to get under a particular area even with the low-profile Bone-ster.
7392	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wooo absorber serves his name right. Love it
1362	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this creeper several months ago after finally becoming sick of grinding to a halt on tiny bits of dirt under my car.  I used it for the first time in anger this afternoon during an oil change and am very pleased with how it performed.  It moved smoothly, even going from concrete onto carpet without slowing down (something my old creeper could never have done).  My only comments are that it could do with a better neck cushion and the 'pods' for the wheels tend to hit on things when underneath the car, but I'm sure that'll change after I get used to using it more frequently.  It isn't cheap, but it seems to be a quality product and it's also made entirely in the USA.

1922	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using one of these for years and I'm on my second one. This duster works exceptionally well and lifts the dust without dragging it around. I will NOT make a filthy car that hasn't been washed in weeks or months look clean. You must either keep your car in a garage, or use a cover like I do, and dust it daily to keep it looking clean. If I wash, clay bar, and wax my car I can go two months or perhaps more without washing it again, as long as I keep it covered, dust daily, and wipe it down weekly with an instant detailer. The fibers are impregnated with a paraffin wax so don't just lay it on something if you don't want it to be stained because of the wax and dirt. Also, if there is condensation on the car it really renders the duster ineffective so make sure it's dry before using it.

991	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I purchaced this generator as a back up unit for my home and for camping. It is fairly quiet and real easy on fuel. There is plenty of power for running the AC and anything else at the same time in my camper. Unfortunatly it is very, very hard to get started in cool weather. I have to remove the air filter and use starting fluid to get in running if it is below 50 degrees. The unit has only about 8 hours on it so far and I hope this will get better as it breaks in. It comes with a extra air filter and spark plug (which I tried changing) but didn't make it better.
9360	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to do the timing belt on my 2000 Acura TL. Crank bolt came off with my impact wrench so I didn't need it. A week later, the motor blew a head gasket. I bought a replacement motor, my impact wouldn't budge its crank bolt. With the engine on a stand, I got this tool out, attached it 1/2" breaker bar and short piece of pipe and wedged them against the floor. Put another 1/2" breaker bar, socket and 4' pipe on the crank bolt and still couldn't break it loose. Ended up with me and my dad, both 200lbs, hanging on a 6' piece of pipe to get the job done. Thanks some serious torque, and this tool took it just fine.
9429	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you're doing a timing belt change on your Honda/Acura V6, you'll need this part to hold the pulley in place with a breaker bar while you try and muscle the bolt off, and then you can use it to rotate the crank shaft to get the timing marks aligned as you put the new bolt on. In my case the dealership wanted to charge me $1200 for the timing belt service, so I didn't feel too bad about splurging for this tool. It did the job!

1. It is sturdy and seems to be very secure.
8878	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I give it three stars because "it is what it is". It's a theft deterrent, and it might stop the lower level car thief looking for a joy ride, or an amateur, but a professional (or even someone who simply knows what to do) can easily cut through the steering wheel and slip the Club right off. You can look on YouTube of videos of people removing the Club from steering wheels, one of them is simply whacking on it with a hammer and it opens. Also, the Club provides a thief with leverage to help him remove the steering wheel altogether, and put on his own! A better option would be a "brake lock" which slips around your brake pedal and prevents it from being used, very hard to remove.

6770	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	After much research for a DC fan for the our travel trailer, I chose this one and I have no reservations. We boondock, aka dry camp (no hookups)exclusively with 2 100 watt solar panels in series recharging our batteries.  This is our choice because we patronize State and National campgrounds that typical don't provide the amenity hookups. If they do they tend to squeeze the sites together, and although we enjoy our fellow campers we prefer to be in touch with nature. Summer heat can be challenging without AC and necessitates the need to move air through the trailer. I've modified the existing bath exhaust vent fan with an improved after market fan and was searching for a window fan to induce air. This fan meets all my expectations by providing 3 speed control and good air movement. Concerning posted complaints of excessive noise, vibration, lacking documentation and poor build quality were not seen in the fan that I received. Yes it does make reasonable noise, slightly vibrates on high (not walking around though), and build quality seems appropriate for intended use. Fan is what I expected and would do it again.

Best headlight cleaner I have ever used and the simplest one to use too! Be sure to read the directions first, but it is simple.
8366	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Got some monkey wood deck chairs and tables that needed oiling after a summer in the sun and a winter in storage. This oil was recommended to me, so I tried it. The recommendation was for two to four coats of the stuff, but the first coat did fine except for the table tops, which needed a second coat. The color and luster came back to the wood, and it looks just like it came out of the box. Dried to usable in less than a day, even though I waited until the second day to park my keester on the chairs. I used maybe an eighth of the bottle on four chairs and two tables. It is very important that you use a high quality piece of cotton cloth or even microfiber as an applicator, because the first piece of cotton cloth I used, an old T shirt, left tiny torn pieces of lint all over the first chair (caught in the raised grain) and it was a pain to get them out. Used a microfiber for the rest with much greater success. Good oil. Goes on easy, dries quickly in the sun. Thumbs up.

seller does not care,
I used the factory manual instructions to do the mount replacement, but I checked the Haynes manual to see if it was what the factory would recommend.  Engine mount replacement details looked spot-on, it is just how I did it (and actually made the suggestion the factory manual did not - which was instead of using a lift, to support the engine with a floor jack under the oil pan - this worked perfectly for me).  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that you only seem to get the general bolt torque guidance in the front of the manual.  Factory manual specifies an exact desired value per-bolt on their diagrams.

3979	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	As always, arrived quickly from Amazon.  I have preferred Master Lock products.  However, I am surprised they would put their name to this item.  The housing does not fit tight to the lug nut.  There is a full one-third inch gap that would allow a point of leverage to pry the lock from the wheel.  It is flimsy enough to do such.  It will also rattle around, due to the floppy fit and is aestetically unattractive.  The top of the housing appears to dangle.  Will buy a cable lock instead.
3842	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good deal

9725	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit perfectly.  K&N is always a good buy. I bought for plenty of vehicles.
Con: The only thing wrong is there is no headrest. If you are on it for more than 30 minutes it becomes surprisingly uncomfortable.
525	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I hate to admit this, but as I was driving to work one morning a gentleman was dragging a Harley Davidson power wheel (PW) to the curb. I have a 2 year old and those PW vehicles can be pretty pricey. So, I stopped and asked if it worked. The man said it did but it needed a battery and batteries for PW are really expensive. Needless to say my next stop was to Amazon, which had the PW battery for far less than I could have bought it any store. Very happy.
3888	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	it is what it is.  looks just like it does in the photo.
9730	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These filters will give you more flow assuming there's not a greater restriction in your intake than the OE type filter.  I put one in a Sierra 1500 with a 4.8 which already had a 18 inch Magnaflow muffler.  I did notice a little smother/quicker response after dropping the filter in.  And could even swear it sounds a little better.  Downside is cleaning it.  You're better off to replace the filter as you run the risk of over oiling, or damaging it in a way that allows dirt through.  You'll never get it like new.  I recommend replacing every 25k or so if you want maximum performance & benefit without risk of dirtying up your mass flow sensor & intake.  So it is a bit costly.  That's why I give it a 4 rather than 5, I don't see it as a cleanable filter.
This mirror stuck without falling off once during a 4 hour family boating outing. The 4" x 8" viewing area seemed large and the images are clear. I tried it in several locations, even on the side window next to my driver's seat. The base provides sufficient flexibility to use it in various angles. It has the added advantage that if I forget to remove it for trailering it won't damage the boat cover because there is noting sticking out of the top of the windshield.
1883	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wow, I finally brought something on Amazon that will actually positively benefit me, unlike the typical goodies I buy that I could actually do without.
DO I LOVE THE HT MOTO EXTRACTOR?
3469	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Once you see water beading up and flowing off your windshield during heavy rain, you'll be hooked. Definitely worthwhile. I have used this product pretty regularly for over 20 years, and will continue to do so until self-driving cars remove my need to see outside the vehicle.
Amazon's price for this battery is around $10 cheaper than retail stores locally. It's a no-brainer for me.

4004	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Much smaller than it looks, way too expensive for its size.  If I'd known how small it was I would not have purchased it.
While it didn't remove all the oxidation, the trailer came from Colorado where the sun is more damaging, it did bring back the white luster and shine it once had. Very happy with the results of the product and would recommend it. It's a lot of hard work, and I'd recommend you use a car buffer/waxer because you need something to really get some power behind it, but so worth the effort for the end result.

The new version could be made much smaller, however, and there are certainly people who would appreciate that in some applications.
The result is after a few hours the plug gets hot hot hot...and the spring inside melts into the plastic housing.  When this happens the fuse is no longer held tight and the unit won't run.
1950	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The first one of these we bought we loved. We used to drive semi and it helped keep the dust down in the truck.

I like the fact that you can wash it (hand wash) and reuse it over and over again without having to replace it every time.

It comes with a carry case to keep it contained.
4040	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm happy with the product
I've read other reviews that talk about streaks at night that make it difficult to see with oncoming headlights ... I don't doubt that those comments are real but I can't explain them ... and my experience has been completely the opposite.  If the coating is reasonably fresh (less than 2-3 months, depending on the time of the year), I simply run without wipers and have no problems whatsoever.  In fact, I can see much more clearly than when using wipers without rain-x.
Performance:

1513	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very nice modified sine wave inverter, one of the few I've found that does not have an "active neutral" configuration.
I definitely noticed a difference in more light on the ground after cleaning with this polish!
I see it lasting for years.
Having said that, I was successful in extracting the old oil out of my mower in only a couple minutes. I can't emphasize how important it is to warm the engine to thin out the oil prior to extraction. I really bought this to do oil changes on my Sea-Doo 4-Tec engine. That engine requires oil extraction through the dipstick tube, as there is no drain plug. This device has a semi-rigid stinger tube that is perfect for that purpose.  As long as I get the oil nice and warm, I'm confident this will easily pull the oil out of my Sea-Doo.
This thing is NOT fragile yet if anyone gets worked up about "getting it done now!" then by all means change oil the old way. Pumping too fast or too hard without holding the pump at the connection with the container WILL bust it up for sure. I think that, plus too much pumping to speed things up IS what all the bad reviews are about.
6212	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	THANK YOU!
I installed the device myself, in about 2 hours. Mounted it inside the grille on a Toyota 4Runner, in front of the radiator where the car horns are located. I got power directly from the battery nearby, ran the other wire through the firewall where the rest of the wiring goes through a rubber grommet, and installed the provided switch on my SUV's lower dash, where I can reach it easily.

7521	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	A must have if you wash your own car (2% of Americans).
The smaller drain opening is cut rather unevenly, making it difficult to create a tight seal even with a cap with paper gasket (as in the case of windshield washing fluid. You can forget about the included plastic cap as it'll never be useful). I picked out one with a relatively flat and clean cut, and it still didn't work. Pretty frustrating.

5217	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is my go-to product for daily care and cleaning of my vinyl boat seats.  The product cleans well, smells nice, and has kept my vinyl seats from fading after many years.  I typically do a quick wipe down of the seats using the Meguiar's vinyl cleaner every time we put the boat up with a rag or a terry cloth towel.  My boat is a 2007 and the seats are still in great condition.  It does a great job of resisting stains and mildew and removing dirt and grime.  I recommend always keeping a bottle of this stuff near your boat for daily use.  It is a phenomenal product at a good price point.
3304	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	My snowmobile loved these plugs!
8947	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have this mounted in the back cabin of my boat.  It's easy to press the button to light it up, and it's plenty bright for viewing the time but not so bright that it's annoying at night.  Working perfectly for what I wanted.  Numbers are large and clear.

5342	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I initially purchased one of these years ago to dry my car... then I used it to dry my mountain bike after rinsing it with the hose... but by far the best us I have found for this is to dry my Labrador Retriever when he finishes his hunt training!  I still carry a couple of towels in the car for dirt, but if he's mostly just wet this works far better than a towel and requires no washing afterwards.  Just keep it in the car.
2006	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic little duster for my car's black interior.  It stows in a small space, and really picks up the dust and dog hair from when the wee beasties go to the groomer.  White dogs, black interior--I really like this little duster!
An additional problem with product and its packaging is that the two rubber step pads provided were stapled together with carton staples - putting holes in the rubber pads. This is a moronic packaging practice. Holes in the step pads collect dirt and allow the dirt to work beneath the step pad causing wear to finish below.

6322	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought a pair of these for my travel trailer. They fit fine and snug up nicely with the tire. While having a lanyard for them sounds tempting, I hate having extraneous parts on my chocks, so I like their simplicity.
5333	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Mounting bracket is too large for average windshield thickness.  Used a block of wood to fill the gap.  Otherwise, it is great for the price.  If you are looking for something stylish, this isn't what you want.  It is as cheap as it's price but will do the job just fine.

Make sure you clean your glass thoroughly before applying Rainx. Rainx is NOT a window cleaner. Work in the shade and use very sparingly. You can do a car windshield with less than a thimble full. Wait for it to dry and remove the haze thoroughly with a clean cloth.

1593	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have owned Clubs for around thirty years. In that time, I have NEVER had any protected vehicle stolen (knock on wood).  While thieves who want your vehicle, and are smart enough to find ways to defeat this unit, are certainly out there, I imagine my vehicles have never been high on their hit list, even though they were new when I bought them.  Still, all but the most professional and skilled car/truck thieves will, most likely, lose interest in boosting your ride as soon as they see this unit on your steering wheel. Add in that most new steering wheels now are wired to the point that cutting them ruins a lot of the technology needed to operate the vehicles' cooler features, and you have a fairly good chance of getting a pass from car thieves, when you use this unit.  This new Club also has a key system that is very unique.  I doubt it can be easily picked.  RECOMMENDED.

Update: I recently received my second Schumacher charger. Amazingly this charger is very noisy compared to the first I bought in 2003. The first one I bought is dead quiet. The second one I bought has a loud buzz like a very noisy fluorescent light transformer. I reduced my rating from a 5 to a 4 because of how loud it is in my garage.

Motorcycle windscreens, motorcycle helmet face shields, and pretty much any clear plastic things that you need to see through...this is the product that extends their lives.  Nowadays, of course, we have clear plastic headlight covers.  Our modern headlights are plastic, on the front of the car, and often pretty low to the ground, subjecting them to nonstop pelting with sand, grit, road grime, and trace solvents sprayed up from the road in the rain.  A perfect cocktail for grinding the smooth finish into matte.

3435	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Newer cars have cap-less fuel tanks that lock the opening and prevent siphoning.  To refill such vehicles from a gas can requires a special adaptor to open the interior lock, but those adaptors work poorly with fuel cans, spilling a lot.  Although this funnel does not replace that unlock adaptor; if so it would rate 6 stars, it fits perfectly into my Ford adaptors and all spilling stopped.  I bought more to have on hand as spares, and to tie on my main gas cans to have handy.  An additional challenge in filling from fuel cans is slow flow rate and air burps.  I have no problems with either challenge using this funnel; I think its now faster than any filling device I've used.

I may be partially to blame for expecting an included lock.  Had I read the whole page, I would have seen it wasn't included.

7504	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used the Absorber for years and I like that they can be kept moist in the case so they are ready to use.  I used to use a chamois, but had to let it try after using it and it would be come very hard. When I'm done with the Absorber, I wring it out, roll it up and put it back into the storage tube.  I leave it under the front seat and it never gets moldy or odd-smelling.  I use it with a single bucket of water -- I dunk the absorber into the bucket, slosh on the water to clean it off, then I rinse off the absorber again, wring it out and dry off the car.  Rinse and repeat.  Leaves very few streaks and has a "grip" that helps clean and dry at the same time.
I used a small file to make a notch across the end of the spout on mine so that I could use the spout to press in the ball-bearing oilers on my lathe and while the spout is pressed against the ball and oil will flow through the two notches. It works perfectly and I couldn't be happier. If you do this, make sure to give it a few pumps after filing the notch so that the dust that falls into the spout can be purges before injecting oil into your machine.
5159	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works better than the leather chamois I have used to dry my car. No spots, washes out easier. I cut into a couple of sections so I have 2 smaller sections for quick jobs around the house. I may buy another one to have a spare.

4887	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the classic absorber and a must for anyone who washes their vehicles. They last forever and work very well. Do let them hang dry people. They are meant to stay damp.

I marked down ease since the old battery case had expanded with age, and I had to remove the UPS case to pry out the old one.  They are supposed to just slide out.  Further, it's always been hard to get the battery terminals reconnected since the wires are barely long enough.

It also says on the side of the bottle that you have to use the tube within 24 hours of opening the seal on the back.  I want to let you know this just isn't true.  If you actually seal the end with packing tape or one of those caps it will keep for easily a week or more if it's out of the sun and heat.  I set up everything I wanted to use this for at the same time, glued everything, didn't use as much as I had expected.  Came back a couple days later found something else and used it again.  2 weeks later found one more thing to use it for and it was still very usable.  I don't know how long it would have kept but it made it through my project, and easily lasted 2 weeks if I resealed the tip of it each time (I didn't seal the back where the plunger goes.

9421	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	thanks!!!!!
9858	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I try to consider several factors in the balance of living well and affordable. I must say that the K&N air filter (listed here) and the recharger kit (not included) is an easy, affordable, and effective combination of product that is well worth the buy and the time. All you do to "recharge" is spray the cleaner (in spray bottle) onto both sides of the filter, let sit for ten minutes to break down the grime, let the ~natural flow~ of water (not pressurized by a nozzle) run through the inside (cleaner side) of the air filter to flush the grime out of the other side (repeat if really dirty [doesn't usually need more than once for me and I change it every 6,000-10,000 miles]), and let dry; I shake it out and then stand it up in the (Arizona) sun to make it dry in ten to fifteen minutes. Then, spray the oil (in the aerosol can) evenly onto the outside (the once dirtier side), and let sit for about twenty minutes to allow for the oil to absorb. Check the crowns and grooves on the opposite side to see the places that do now have or need more oil; the filter is whitish and the oil is red in color so you will be able to see where the oil is and how much is there. Repeat until the whole filter is red with oil, wipe the excess oil from the rubber frame, install the clean filter back into your vehicle, start the engine, and listen to that air flow :D.
1607	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well on my pathfinder. Super quick to take on and off. I like that I can get into my truck first then while seated can take it off. Only things to note is that it's quite heavy and that when you pick it up to put it on keep the pull out end upwards or else it will slide out and you will have to use your key to unlock and shorten. A bit of a pain in the rear until you get used to it. Love the fact that you can lock it to your wheel without using the key.

I ran it through the washing machine and then accidentally through the dryer. It came out looking like a tumbleweed made out of pasta, but as soon as I got it wet it regained its original texture. Really odd material. Works great!

6531	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When you think about sealing a hole below the water line in a boat, you certainly want a product that you know for certain will work. I have used 3M 5200 Marine adhesive and sealant for years. I can tell you emphatically, IT WORKS! The nice thing about these smaller  amounts is that once you puncture the seal and use the product, the remaining product will likely harden in the tube. So with these smaller amounts, you are not subject to losing so much money in the process. The 5200 is permanent but 3M also makes a semi permanent caulk as well.

7665	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just trust me here; get this and the Meguiars drying towel and you'll have your car completely dry and streak free in no time. This soaks up the bulk of the water and the other gets rid of all the mist. Great product that I've been using for years!
For less than what it costs to have a Dodge dealer read the code, this did the trick.


5200 is perfect for all things marine related that require a nearly permeant seal. follow the directions, clean/prep surface, Read Label. Takes 5 days to dry, may skin in 2 or so, but this should be given a sold week/7 days to cure before put in wet/underwater conditions. a 24 fast cure is also available in 5200, but only the small 3oz. tubes.
8285	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great. Large mirror and the suction cup is really strong.

Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The "booster car" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.

5144	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I was prepared to write a "sham-why" review because initially this thing acted like a sheet of nonabsorbent rubber, but once it started soaking water it seemed to 'open up' and began working pretty well.  It wrings out easily and leaves no lint, which is pretty rad,  because the old bath towels I was using before made my car fuzzy.
698	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Exact fit replacement. easy to install. Works perfect. my unit had the 5" motor with the belly band clamp and this replacement was the right fit no modifications necessary.

The included carrying case is useless. It is at least three times too small.
5899	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product
8658	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used this about 5 times so far.  The only problem I had with it is that it would not go down the check tube of my mercury mountaineer far enough to extract the oil.  It works great on both of the ford taurus' tho.  I haven't tried it on anything else.  But it has paid for itself almost twice after 5 oil changes.  This is really worth it.
7446	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is a quality harness. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because it should have at least 6-12" longer ground wire. Ended up cutting off a ton for the lights. Had they invested another .01 cents to extend the ground wire, I would not have had to move the ground screw up. Seems like a no brainier. i would buy again though.
1012	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I usually have my vehicles serviced by the local Ford Dealer. However, I purchased a new John Deere Riding Lawn Mower for our oversized lot. Since having the mower picked up and delivered for service is rather pricey, I purchased this pan to drain the transmission fluid (fore and aft) on this great mower. This drain pan is the ideal size for this chore and a good buy.
4. Put oil extractor hose into dipstick tube until it stopped
5669	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's a decent extra light for brake/tail light for the money.  I installed on my Wrangler and it snugged right up to it with the foam sealing piece whereas others have stated it did not.  I'm leaving the standard bub in there because it's the same brightness as my stock tail lights.  Don't plan on upgrading to LED's because of the problems I've heard from all the Chinese knock offs.  I'm sticking with the standard bulbs and everything is fine.  I did wrap the exposed color wires with rubber tape and sealed that with electrical tape....all is well and working good.  Now 4 bright stop/brake lights hit them from behind instead of 3.
Having said all that, assuming the red lint eventually goes away altogether, this is about a s good as it gets for dust, pollen removal.  As others have said, pay attention to directions.

3527	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Great idea/concept, but not for all applications, I suppose.  Lock latch wouldn't engage backing plate.  Had to return it, look for something else. FYI, the hardware this unit was mounting over was probably too large, the threaded shank being 1/2'".  Anything smaller may have worked.

And yes he was prepared with a hacksaw to cut the steering wheel. He first tried to pick the club lock or break it but failed, He then cut into the steering wheel but either got spooked or just gave up. The Club did what it was intended to do. It saved the van from being stolen. Total damage to steering wheel and locks with repairs and new Club and Club break lock: $1500.00. Cost of van with tools $40,000.00.

2220	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Here is the short version of my story. My teenage son complained of his check engine light on.  Knowing that it would be at least $100.00 to take his car to the shop, I purchased the Actron CP9135.  In no time it said the vehicle had had 4 random misfires in the cylinders.  Knowing this was rather unusual, I asked my son if he had run his car out of gas.  Bingo! Problem diagnosed.  I cleared the codes,and the car is running fine.  Well worth the money.

Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.

8349	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I've had "hitch haulers" in the past that were solid steel and very heavy. I tried this because it is aluminum and much lighter. It is too flimsy and only for very very light use. I can't return it because I already assembled it and tried it. Wasted time and money.

 I noticed a comment in the editorial review, that a pro might need more speed. NOT. This polisher covers the proper speed. A burn mark in a polished finish, looks like a raising of the material, in a little series of ridges. Another peril of too much speed is a quick burn through the finish, revealing base coats for example primer. I mention this because this is the heavy duty unit. You don't need something faster, or more powerful. You would be hard pressed to find another tool out there that does the job better. The competition, with less power, slower speeds, and that funny handle that goes over the top of the polisher is not what you want. I went into the local home center and felt that handle position just today. It is uncomfortable for polishing. You want your hand out out to one side of the head, just the way this Milwaukee is. They further enable you to choose a side, in the event that you are left handed. It gives you a wider stance with a side handle, which equals better control.
222	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Even though it lists models to 2011, this has very, very few notes on the JK. Do not buy if you have the JK.

I had to perform the process twice as there had not been enough energy transferred to start the dead car's engine on just one cycle.  I saw this in other people's posts and I just wanted to see it myself so I can act accordingly.  This is perfectly fine.  Just be warned that this is normal and fine.  I have a large battery in the dead car, so this is understandable.  It did turn the engine over a bit, so that's a good sign.  After the 2nd time it started right away.

8636	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What can I say about the Hydro-Turf Oil Extractor OIL01 that hasn't already been said about the wheel, penicillin, or the iPhone.... this is one of the greatest inventions of all time. My wife and I would argue constantly over who had to change the oil or the transmission fluid. It's one of those chores NO ONE wants to do! You know, the old "I spent the entire day rearing OUR children, maybe YOU can pitch in a little and change the fluids?" and of course, "You think I have the energy to slave over your car and change the fluids? I worked a 12 hour shift just to come home to THIS?!" These are the things that can destroy an entire relationship. It got to the point where our children could sense the tension. The minute I heard our 20 month year old son reenacting our daily fluids changing fight with his GI-Joe, I knew we had to make a change. That's when I found the Hydro-Turf Oil Extractor OIL01. Our marriage has never been healthier.
8274	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works efficiently.......could not ask for more!
5076	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	We got this to use trying to dry our shower daily. It did great absorbing the water, however, it kind of stuck to the shower walls and was not a smooth wipe. We have found other drying towels that dry just as well but glide over the shower wall with ease.

Just fast,faster.fastest, mine came with the knob all loosy goosy and required a socket to tighten jam nut, missing rubber foot pad, fan blade is clear ,original was white , also the 12v plug cracked after a couple of pulls from the socket
2390	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I love this unit, but not for my mini van.  It really stretches out and then when I add my popup camper, it only hangs 5 inches off the ground.  Makes me a bit nervous driving.  This would be great for SUVs or Truck, not a minivan.
To ensure I don't get repeat flats, I check the tire religiously for the source of the puncture. Usually, its a piece of metal wire or burr that remains in the tire. It takes a very keen eye to find the problem (sometime you need to run your nail around the tire to find it or realign your tube where the puncture was). This is what I'm guessing some people struggle with. If you don't remove the source, as you refill your tire, the tube will re-puncture where the source was and you have the same issue you started with.
1635	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great for quick cleanup / dusting of car.

Update..the whine did not go away and was driving me nuts!!! Who could not notice the whine noise from the Atwood motor??? I ended up taking off the grill on the side that is near the back of the motor so plastic would not amplify the noise. Now it is bearable.  They should have used a better motor or had better noise reduction.. At this pricd and their nsme on the line there is no excuse for the unmistakeable high pitched torturing whine!!!!!!

Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it. I think it is some kind of mold. I used it anyway and it still dries well, but I don't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car. I think I will go back to towels.

6811	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	A lot of work but worth it.  Took gel coat that looked flat and restored the shine.
***BE SURE TO INVEST IN REAL BREAKER BARS!!***
7664	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I find it a bit humorous that reviewers keep saying "it doesn't absorb water".. then they state later on that they have to ring all of the water out all of the time. Are they ringing out "air" ? Of course is absorbs the water. It is just not good at drying the car for the final wipe. I use a towel after using this. That's worked well for many years. I tried a "waffle towel" and it was worse than the absorber. I tried a special auto towel, but that did not work as well either. I think that the absorber used with a towel is probably the best combo to use. I suppose you can turn on the leaf blower, but if you get any dirt in there you may do a number on your paint.
7623	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great
9383	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There's a great YouTube video for the 2006 Acura TL out there. I thought that I might be able to get by with a 19mm socket, 1/2" impact wrench and extension but purchased this just in case. Glad I did--the impact wrench didn't come close. Ended up needing to use this with one 1/2" breaker bar to prevent the crank from rotating while I broke the bolt loose with the 19mm impact socket, 2x 10" impact extensions (resting on a jack stand for stability) and another 1/2" breaker bar. A 4' pipe over the breaker bar to provide extra leverage would have been helpful, but was able to get by without. Used a 1/2" 25-250 ftlb Tekton torque wrench to re tighten (181ftlb) when finished.
Suepriselly, I found it works perfect on the 722.6 transmission. when you change ATF, just mesure the proper distance from the end, then it can extract the excessive ATF to keep a perfect oil level.

Well, after only two years this thing took a dump.  I contacted Tripp-Lite and after answering their questions and requesting a schematic so I can fix it myself (because it is out of warranty), they responded with, Well, yes, you're right it sounds like it is now in need of replacement. But,,,,we don't provide schematics for safety (and some other half-assed reason) so well, just go buy a new one from us, K? (I think not!!)

When used this way, this extactor will work for you for quite some time. I really like the pour out spout included so, don't leave any oil in your machine. This crank case oil is very detergent to the Sphere's plastic!
Nothing much to say besides that this fits i,t and is the one the manufacturer recommends.

9467	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This tool worked great on 98 Accord with the 3.0L V6. It was difficult to research which size I needed, but this was the correct one! I had to do the "starter-crank" method to break the bolt loose, as none of my impacts or breaker bars could get it. Sure they say it is dangerous to do it but heck it worked! :-)
5299	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The Absorber Chamois saves you from excessive wiping. It saves time and does the job better that any normal chamois. I will buy this anytime and since it lasts long it will be a for my next purchase!!
Cons:
440	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The decals are detailed and have crisp lines. I haven't applied them yet, but they look well-made. The vinyl looks like it is good quality.
I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. The discount has not influenced or impacted my judgment of this product. I take this seriously and my opinion and experience is my own. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.



3042	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit a 2003 Chevy Cavalier perfectly. got tired of the old sheets covering it for long term storage and this fit like a glove. I removed the antenna so no holes needed to be cut, but you could punch a hole in it and seal the edges pretty easily to stop running threads.

320	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's a great book to have covers most of the entire truck... nearly identical to the Haynes book, except its bigger and the chapter table of contents are listed by section rather than alphabetically based on the subject which makes it more difficult to locate a particular subject within the chapter... also, they use the same pictures in both books.

4958	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic. Dries very well. For those that think it should be a 100% streak free dry go elsewhere. That is not how a shammy works. A shammy will dry most of the water but not all and you will always have a small wipe up with your favorite microfiber. However it won't be much wiping with your microfiber. I highly recommend this product it is a time saver.

9980	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect size for my needs.  I use it for some xtra convenient storage (cell, cigs, gum,  etc.) and for a bit of occasional trash. Fits the hump great,  doesn't shift around, and is not obtrusive in size..  Leak-proof lining and easy removal for cleaning are definite pluses. I find no issues with rigidity as some reviewers have stated, perhaps they are not snapping in the supports.  My only gripe is that at $20 it's a little pricey.

1753	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	It's ok. Not great. For it to work the car has to be completely cool. If you try to use it when the car has been in the sun, the brush smears wax or something like that and it's hard to get it off the finish. Along with that, it spreads lint all over the car, and you have to get a cloth, to try and wipe it off. I am not a fan of the duster.  If you want to clean your car, get a cloth and some detail spray. It works better and you will be happier with the results. The cal duster is too much effort.
280	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	i have had haynes or chiltons manuals for every vehicle we've owned for many years now other than for our jaguar and that we just leave to the dealership. when we picked this vehicle, the hhr we got it as a running around vehicle. i assumed it would be simple to find a manual and do all those things i am used to doing so we don't have to drive all the way into town for every little thing. but i was so wrong, checked three different auto parts stores in person and online and none carried haynes or chiltons for the hhr. checked the dealer, no, checked online with the hhr owners forum said none were available. even checked with amazon online granted it was last may but still i hoped but no such luck. then on a whim i checked again two weeks ago and there she was. i didn't hesitate to buy it and literally as soon as had mine ordered the other had been sold as well. i just got the manual in the mail yesterday and could not be happier. i have absolutely no plans to rebuild the engine or tear into the electronics but no i can at least change a headlight bulb, aim the headlights, swap out the oil filter, cabin air filter, the very difficult to figure out access to the engine air filter, capacities and so many other things i don't have to rely on others to do for me now as well as saving a small fortune in labor costs to do things i am perfectly capable of doing now with haynes in hand! unless you have a vehicle like a jaguar or range rover for example you really must have a manual like this. it is the best investment for the dollar you can make in your vehicle imho.

9095	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We use this in our shop to attach metal heat tags to remanufactured engines and cylinder heads.  It works perfectly for that purpose, much to the dismay of the customers that try to say "I never overheated it."  It's cheap insurance that has saved us thousands in undeserved warranty claims.

2452	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Overall pretty nice, however, if you leave it out in the rain, even for a relatively short time, the lock will already start to get rust-powder on it, which you have to blow off, and my numbers froze up pretty good to where I had to really wrestle with it to get them moving again. This was on a brand new one that had only seen rain maybe twice, WITH the rubber guard over it.

I used to own the Mityvac which broke after a few uses. Replacement parts were too expensive and I ended up tossing the $75 product. The thing was bulky, hard to fit into the car when taking it to dump the oil. Other complaints include the hose being too short and requiring too may pumps to extract oil. Many complaints about that, so I wanted a better alternative when it came to replacing the unit.

During light rains or when the roads are wet and mist is kicked up from the tires on the vehicle in front of you, this does a great job of keeping the beading moving up and off of the windows to the point that you don't really even need your wipers.  In moderate or heavy rains, it does a great job of keeping the water beaded up so vision isn't as reduced as it is on untreated windows.

I've found that the highest setting really doesn't do much more than the 2nd setting in terms of moving air; all it really does is make noise. In my limited experience with this fan, I think that the lowest setting is adequate for creating a steady air current in my camper van.

8735	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these to replace existing boat trailer/dust cover grommets of the same brand.  One of the original grommets had split apart and when I replaced it (and another one since there were two new ones in a package) I realized how poor of a condition the original grommets were in.  Replacement is easy, just pull the old ones out and the new ones 'snap' right in.  They must work well since I've owned this particular trailer about 10 years (purchased used) and the wheel bearings are in fine condition.

2193	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased one of these coolers and am very pleased with how well it worked, as quiet as a whisper.  The power consumption is reasonable.  If battery drain is a concern, once the Koolatron is cold you can unplug it for a while and it will stay cool for quite some time.

I give this cooler a A+ on function, have not tried the heat mode yet, maybe next winter.
I installed one on my Chevy Sonic that uses a dual element 3157 bulb for the backup light. Researching online I found the 3157 bulb is a dual element version of the 3156 bulb, and installing one on my Sonic worked well. Not too loud and not too quiet, either.

5401	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	'mirror' part not exactly high grade 'lens' material, but for a budget purpose does the job...  seems to screw into place securely and is the right size and seems solid enough. WE always have more than one person in the boat if we're towing someone, so this was more to be legal in case we ever wanted to have just driver and person being towed...  and for the driver to be able to peak on their own without relying on the other passenger.  SO, this fits our needs well enough in spite of the lack of crisp visual.  It's ok to good, not good to great.

There was already minor corrosion before I started using this but after one of them sank and the other partially flooded (both in salt water), it seemed like a good idea to try to keep the corrosion down. After rinsing with fresh water, sprayed the corrosion inhibitor on steel and aluminum components. Nearly a year later there is no additional corrosion.

7828	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I initially purchased one of these years ago to dry my car... then I used it to dry my mountain bike after rinsing it with the hose... but by far the best us I have found for this is to dry my Labrador Retriever when he finishes his hunt training!  I still carry a couple of towels in the car for dirt, but if he's mostly just wet this works far better than a towel and requires no washing afterwards.  Just keep it in the car.
I had to insert a piece of 1" wood to fill the channel above the windscreen for the clamp to bite onto, and the knob hits the roof, making it hard to tighten, but it is flexible enough to do, and could have replaced with a bolt, but works fine- nice cast hardware and ball joint on the back of the mirror head, so I can dial that right in. Perfect for this application.

I haven't had it on long enough to get a good feel of any improved mileage. I currently am getting 10-11 mpg. Hopefully, I see some improvement, but it would just be a bonus. I purchased this to save money on air filters over the long term.
If you want an effective parking aid that will positively park your car in the same place everytime, then (...)They come in yellow or blue. The curb may cost more than the Park-Zone, and the shipping is not free; but the curb works. I have one for my truck and compact tractor, and I just ordered one for my wife's car. Just be certain you can drill 3/4" holes in concrete for the lead lag shields to secure the curb to the floor.

3044	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I recently went to Autozone and asked for a Milton tire gauge. They not only did not sell them, they had never heard of them. I reluctantly spent $17 on one of Autozone's company gauges. Upon checking my tractor tires that evening it broke. I returned it and ordered this Milton gauge. I have used Milton gauges for years and have been highly satisfied. Even though Milton's are twice as expensive as the general store bought gauges, they seem to me to be worth it. The user should oil the gauge sparingly once every three months - 3 drops will do.

Meguiar's has been one of my favorites for over 30 years. Highly recommended.
1721	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love these California Car Dusters and have been using them for years on all of my cars. I have covered parking so these work well if your car is slightly dusty, I would not advise using one if your car is extremely dusty or if your car gets wet (like overnight) then has dried dust/dirt on it. I have actually used a leaf blower to blow my car first (when it's really dusty) then used the CCD as a finishing touch. Yes, it does leave parafin or oil swirls on the glass and sometimes on the painted surface, but then I wipe those away with a microfiber cloth and my car looks just washed. I've tried others that use static electricity, but they don't seem to work very well (for me). When they get a little too old to use on my cars (generally three years or more), I use them on my mailbox, gate motor cover, (some) outdoor statues and planters, outside lights, etc. Living in Southern California, we find many ways to conserve water.

I particularly like the way it is wired: Green, yellow, two browns, and white. That is, this is a 4 flat connector but has five wires, if you include the white ground wire in the count: Makes it very easy to connect to two trailer lights. The rubber connector has a slight angle and is ribbed which make it much easier to grab and pull out.
6693	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It looks really nice on the hitch. It was no problem to install(no brainer). You just have to remember to take it easy going over a speed bump. It hangs down low on a car, I guess on a truck it wouldn't really matter though.

It pays to have a backup generator when you consider how miserable life in the country can be without power.  With wood heat that's not the issue but no indoor plumbing when the well isn't working is no fun.  Think about the cost of replacing your freezer/refrigerator food and $300 is good insurance over a number of years.

The chamois will dry out and become hard if left exposed, but once you wet it again, it becomes as absorbent and pliable as new.
This is for the PUMPS only ... resin/hardener NOT included

5067	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are the best Chamois for your car. Especially odd shaped sports cars.
4550	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I will always buy the "Absorber".  I used to work at a luxury detailing carwash in high school and during college and we always used these.  Great on cars!
Like watching paint dry and grass grow.
3448	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used as directed,  this is really helpful stuff when the weather turns bad. I would not kid about the weather.
4757	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great on our old trailer. Improved the usability 300% Would definitely buy again.

8829	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's the Club. It won't create world peace, or cure cancer, or even get you more dates. Heck, if someone really wants your car, it won't even stop them (they can just cut the steering wheel). So why did I give it 5 stars? It is a visual deterrent. It's entire purpose in life is to make the would-be car thief move on past your car and set his/her target elsewhere.

7198	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good product, I'm using it to clean my car and it's much easier and faster to remove the water of it. It does not adsorb everything in the first time you use but it's much better than a normal towel.
I installed this one on a dump trailer so it keeps the battery charged.
9034	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Wow what can I say about this little blower? This is quite the blower: very powerful and well made. I love it! I used to use a leaf blower but the Metro Blower is much easier and more powerful. The hose is the best quality rubber hose that I have seen you don't have to worry about it scratching the paint if it bumps your car or motorcycle. The tip on the hose is also made of soft rubber. I do recommend purchasing the little dolly with it otherwise I think you would almost have to carry it around by the handle in one hand the carry the hose in the other. With the little dolly it just follows you everywhere you go and has never turned over. I have a small shop with a drain in the floor so a can wash the car, truck and motorcycle inside. With this being said I'm not sure how well it would work if you were outside because the wind would dry it before you could get it blown off maybe. I use it to blow of all my vehicles and my dog. The hotter it is outside the hotter the Metro Vac will blow. It does not heat up the air as some seem to believe it should. The heat comes from the motor as you run it. Even in cool weather it will blow warm air after it has run for awhile. It takes awhile to get used to blowing off your vehicle. You want to start at the top and try to blow in the same dirrection because if you have to change dirrection you will blow water back on what you just dried. You have to keep moving the water with the blower until its all blown off.
6732	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've used quite a bit of this product over a number of years.  I generally consider this a permanent product.  There are some solvents out there that can help to loosen it, but my experience would rate this as permanent.  Does not like some plastics so be sure to check compatibility prior to use. The product is not a "caulking", it is an adhesive sealant.  It will dry to a dull finish and not white & shiny like silicone tub caulking.  It is fairly think and can get everywhere if not careful.  One minute you touch it with your finger to make a nice bead & the next minute you find it on your shirt, pants, door knob to the house & kitchen faucet ... two weeks later you find it in your ear (ok, a little exaggeration but......).  Clean up any "messes" fast!  If memory serves me right, it takes something like 7 days for full cure.  Be sure you understand this.  Things may come in contact with it during this time & forever become part of the "bond".  Need it to cure faster?  Try the 5200FC (fast cure - red tube).  Need it to come apart easier later?  Try the 4200.
1980	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I wanted to like this thing, it does clean dust off your dash but it leaves behind little red particles nearly everywhere in the 3 vehicles I've used it on.  It seems to be worse on textured surfaces but it will also leave red particles behind on your touch screen, gauge panel and just about anywhere else you use it.  Never had this problem with its full size vehicle exterior counterpart. Maybe that gets better with time but for something that is supposed to clean it sure is annoying to have to pick tiny red threads and red dust off your cars interior.

4707	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Auto battery life can be significantly lengthened with the use of a trickle charger. Significantly. I put this one into my 4X4 to keep my Interstate battery at maximum readiness. This is a solid heavy duty device and is no toy. I mounted it securely under the hood next to the battery itself and have a heavy duty plug hanging down -- just behind the front bumper -- to connect up while out in the driveway. The lights/indicators on this model are very nice and it keeps my battery at full strength. If you have two vehicles (or more) and you don't drive one of them that often -- definitely get one of these. You will never have another "oh no" moment -- when turning that key in the morning. Highly recommended.
7750	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great on wet cars.  very soft once you get it wet and soaks up a lot of water,  much more than a chamois.
1594	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Arrived quickly and serves as an excellent deterrent to thieves.

2010	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great duster for the interior of any automobile. High quality and should last for years to come. Great price.
6745	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	We used this kit to wax our RV from 1999. This kit is a 3 step process with a different bottle/chemical for each step. Each bottle/step requires a different type of buffing pad for your buffer, so hopefully you have that available. It took a lot of effort, but after the third step our RV was a totally different color! It went from old dingy yellow to a nice new off-white. It didn't take it back to white-white but it definitely got close. If you put the sweat into it, this kit definitely works!! Couldn't be happier with the results. Would definitely recommend.
4728	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product, goes on easily and buffs-out by hand to a beautiful shine. I take care of my boat, if yours is in poor shape then it's time for compounding followed by waxing, all with a machine buffer.
9666	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	These are the most ILL FITTING crappy , no good , Lousy, cheap, no good pieces of JUNK that I have ever bought!

I only needed ONE as mine was broken from not watching what I was doing so now I have NONE thanks to those pieces of Garbage! I just wish I could send them back! What a rip off!
2961	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I was shocked to find how easy this cover will tear while it's wet. During a rain storm a small twig fell from a near by tree ripping the cover. Best use as a dust cover for a garaged vehicle only.
2122	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've bought 2 other nets like this here on Amazon. The first one was a little too tight. The second one was "elastic", but had poor tension. This one is a nice medium between the two. It's meant to fit a moto helmet, but you could put a lot of different things. I personally carry groceries. You could fit a basketball too. The hooks are both good and bad. It's good because they're plastic, which means, they won't scratch your fairing, but bad because they're not secured too tightly -- when the net is tense you don't have to worry, but when not tense, the hooks can come off, so be careful if you have a thin bike and there's a lot of slack.

For the first 24 hours it worked and it adhered well to the area around the leak too.  Then the area were the tiny crack was started to go from clear to white and bubble.  Then gas began to seep from under the 2" round patch I'd made.  I made the patch that big to ensure adhesion on a possible seep leak, but after it started coming out the whole path was subverted with gas.  In the end, the adhesive area that had initially turned white from gas contact became so gooey gas leaked directly from center of the path too.

So read, or study the drawings carefully for YOUR VEHICLE, and know which part you have in your hand before you do anything. If you use a pair of snips or side cutters wear some eye protection as when the tabs are clipped they fly off with some velocity. OR...snip them about a third of the way and then just bend them off.
The stick part does not fill over 3/4 with liquid.  Also it has no 'lock' -- just moving the thing across the car causes the stick to push liquid out so that it empties and needs refilling just as often as you would dunk a regular sponge mop.  I'm returning it.

My wife had a 02 Ford Escape and the headlights were solid yellow. So much that I was looking into spending a substantial amount of money to purchase a power sanding headlight restoration kit as I hand zero hope that anything would work and just be a snake oil. I applied this product about three times before I started to notice discoloration was going away. I found me a sturdy terry cloth and put elbow grease into the headlight. Multiple applications (guessing about 10) resulted in the headlights being clear enough I could almost see the filament in the bulbs again! Did this product take away the deep scratches and pits? Heck no but did not expect it to.! Common sense says a 13 year old light will need more than some cream to bring it back to original condition. After spending about 30 minutes and lots of elbow grease I got the lights to a nearly clear state and was highly satisfied with this product.
I bought this 2nd unit because i have a diesel vehicle that is not working well that i am working on from time to time. It has trouble starting so it may need to crank a long time, and because the compression of diesel engines is 4-5 times as much as gas engines, diesel starters use more current, and since the engine won't fire unless the starter cranks at full speed, a drop in voltage will prevent starting. There is also the glow heating cycle to consider, with each glow plug drawing several amps. Diesel engines depend more on the cranking amps delivered by the battery.

7433	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Kinda pricey but nothing on a boat is cheap. I installed these in my 96 Mercury 115 HP 2 stroke outboard, replacing the non-resistor version to rid myself of a ticking noise coming out of my 6x9 speakers at idle. Sure enough these did the trick. No more tick. I also went 2 mph faster than before with the same load but it could have been the wind. It definitely didn't hurt the performance and it sure did fire up easier. For the $28 I paid for four plugs you can't go wrong. I couldn't even get a good RCA noise filter for that much.
7820	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.

637	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I ordered these, not to jumper my battery, but to power a 12-volt winch, which can draw a lot of power. I think they are just the ticket!
One advantage of a clip on might be that the mirror could be mounted above the windshield frame for a potential better rear view.

They also blend in well with the black bed rail covers on my truck.
The drain cap is also plastic on plastic. Though at the store it could be fastened tightly--both the included cap and a windshield washer fluid bottle cap. That quickly changed though when there's oil--both caps leaked (yes, even the windshield washer fluid cap which has a paper/fiber insert as seal), and couldn't be fastened as it would just slip off the threads QUITE easily. In the end I had to put my latex glove over the opening *and* the threads to force on the cap to prevent a leak, and only barely.
The lenses on my 2007 Camry had a light haze forming. It was hazy enough to look bad but probably not enough to reduce night time light output. Most of the haze was from the top to the middle, probably because that's where the sun hits the most. After reading about different products I decided to try the least expensive and easiest method first. I purchased PlastX and in about 20 minutes both lenses were clear again. I simply applied the product and rubbed it into the lens, and repeated in areas that required it. This product will not eliminate scratches or pitting. It will only eliminate a light haze. If you have anything more than a light haze you'll probably need one of the wet sanding products and need to spend an hour or more on each lens to carefully remove the oxidation.

5536	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fit and look very nice, the most important of all is protected the bumper from scratch.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone
* It tends to not absorb all the water, even when you start. It'll leave small thin streaks on the car which you have to pass over again.
6957	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Finally an efficient quiet 12V fan. Use it on my pontoon boat for when we're sitting still enjoying some (not wine officer) and cheese at sunset...

5 stars!!
9489	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The tool worked great.  You will need a breaker bar to hold the crankcase tool while removing the crankcase pulley bolt.  That bolt too will need a large breaker bar and a 20" extension.  Worked like a charm with these additional tools.

The beauty here is, once the vacuum is created you can step away. Relax. Get a brewsky. Once in a while give it a few more pumps to keep the vacuum up.
2. Lining up the timing marks was pretty tricky, but by setting it at TDC before taking off the belt and pulley, then putting drill bits in the holes at the tops of the cams to hold them at TDC helped a lot. Once I had lined up the crank timing mark (crank sprocket to oil pump housing) and threaded the timing belt in the proper order, I rocked the cam sprockets back and forth slightly with a 12 mm wrench to get the belt to slide on them.
81	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I really like this pen! I wasn't sure it would be useful at first but I've already been through two refills (cross 8518-4).

3994	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What can you say about an item like this? Well it did its job and it came cheap. Can't ask for much more out of a cheap funnel. I use it for my oil changes and it hasn't failed me yet. The blue is also nice if you are picky about that sort of thing. Anyway, it's a funnel, need one? Buy this one. You won't regret it.

5699	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Based on several comments on Amazon about this product I decided to add another brake light to my Chevy Silverado. I live in a college town and with over 50,000 students when in full session, the driving gets a little crazy. So I'll do whatever it takes to make myself more visible. This brake light, added to the trailer hitch, does just that. As others have commented, I also noticed that some drivers stop further behind me than is normal. I believe it's because this brake light is the lowest, being in the trailer hitch, and some people stop where they can see the brake lights!

1170	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It works
588	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is outstanding quality.  Only thing I wish was a tiny bit different is I wish there was an ever so slight indentation in the backing so that you could more easily center it on the backing pad.  So I give it a 4 1/2 instead of a five but I would buy it again.

2628	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	More than adequate for its intended use!  Compared to the bags available at the "stealerships", they are just as good and 35% less expensive.  If you don't find yourself desperately in "need" of a motorcycle brand logo, then THIS is the bag for you!  I have over 100 helmets (with various makes of bags for protection), and these bags are as up to the task as all of the others.

The fan blades would rub on the inside of the housing if you tried to move the fan while it was turned on.  I returned the fan and they send me a replacement that works flawlessly.  The fan blows a lot of air and does not draw an excessive amount of power.

5294	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I'm quite an avid automotive detailer, and strive to keep my Corvette Z06 in showroom condition which is difficult with how many miles I put on it. So regular washes are necessary to keep the grime off. I had previously been using a microfiber type drying towel, which was lent to a friend who never returned it. So before washing my car one day I ran over to Autozone and purchased on of these 'Absorbers'. While it is good at removing the large buildups of water on a vehicles surfaces, it is not good for final streak free drying. No matter how hard you wring this Absorber out, it still leaves water streaks. I had to run out to find a suitable drying towel and re-wash my car to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left. Since using it, I have purchased a "Carrand 40059AS Microfiber MAX Supreme Deep Pile Fiber Drying Towel" through Amazon, and my goodness what a difference. So now I use the absorber for removing the bulk of water from my Z06, then finish up with the Carrand Drying Towel.

6506	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought two of these and like the way they perform.  They seem to absorb a large amount of water before they start to leave streaks behind.  I would have given them 5 stars except when you get them out after being stored damp (as the instructions tell you to do) they have a mildew smell.  I started putting them back in the clear tube case and leaving the top off until they dry completely.

It did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You won't have that problem with this vacuum

1037	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the best style of non-skid pad for snow conditions. The sandpaper style is appropriate for interior, dry, conditions. But they're almost useless in snow. The deeper profile of the rubber grips on this pad makes a big difference. I use these on my skid steer where it's real easy to slip when climbing in-and-out in snowy conditions. So far, this rubber stick-on pad has worked well. I have to replace them every few years... but, such is life.

No complaints on this unit. It does what it's supposed to do and does it better than the competition. The price is more competitive and it's easier to store. No regrets on the purchase. Although it takes me just as long to do my oil change as it would if I had to put my car up, crawl under there, remove the pan and pull the drain plug, at least I can write this review while my oil's being extracted automatically from the HT Moto oil extractor.
342	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I loved this repair manual, it was really quite helpful. I wish there was a little more detail in some steps, but overall was plenty enough for the job. I will be buying a second one because I had the unfortunate timing of starting a brake pad and rotor replacement as a thunderstorm was setting in, and my manual got soaked by the rain.

After an 1800 mile trip over the past week, I have to say that the Koolatron definitely made a difference, and for the price, it's worthwhile. Absolutely recommended.


I would recommend them to a friend.
The pour area is really too small for anything bigger than quarts.
In closing - I have done the cardboard/blanket and cheap creeper thing --- this is like a Cadillac over a Pinto - no comparison. I highly recommend it if you spend a lot of time on your back under rigs like I do.

9163	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great, have used for several years on a number of vehicles after my first two encounters with deer, one totaling the vehicle, the other causing  much damage. I travel in a highly populated deer area daily, at all hours,  with many deer standing along the side of the road. The noise causes them to stop and look. Highly recommend.

7586	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to dry off my dogs and it works great. Not sure how it absorbs as much water as it does.  It dries my dogs twice as fast as a regular towel and I no longer have to use my towels!  Easy to rinse off and reuse.
8573	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used it to change the oil just once so far to change the oil and filter on a tdi vehicle. So far so good, good suction, easy set up. I would recommend this product.

8651	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This pump is very well made, very easy to use, and though expensive, will pay for itself with just a few simple oil changes. I have already done a boat and a car oil change. I wish someone would invent an automatic filter changer! I recommend this fine product.
Initially, it will leave a bit of streaking on dark paint as the waxy substance that grabs dirt can come off a bit, but as you use it--and it gets dirtier--it works better and better.  The streaks easily come off with a quick spritz of detail spray.

3428	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist, when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use. When you apply before the cold weather, though, it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield, which is just great. I also like to use the product on the back window, which doesn't have a wiper, because it keeps the window clearer. Follow the directions--let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear. I'm sure you'll like it.
7377	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked very well for rewiring hauling trailer. I would buy this again.

5535	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product. This is a good strong step and has even kept people away from my tailgate in parking lots.
7000	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits tight with my light adapter.  I like the fact the ground wire is wired into the plug and not a loose wire that is bolted to truck frame.  Without a good ground, brake lights won't work right.  This cable worked great and works much better than harbor freight cable.
9504	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This tool is a MUST if you are changing your Honda timing belt, or other tasks that require you to remove the crankshaft drive pulley.  It is a loose fit, and has to be held in position until you put torque on it, but otherwise does what it should.  would be a five star tool if it fit better in the hex socket and was slip resistant.  WARNING! this tool has nothing to do with it, but if you are changing your timing belt, the bolt may be super tight, and you will need a big friend and cheater handle or a  thumping big air impact wrench to get the bolt loose, even with this tool. Without the tool or one like it, good luck.
4383	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent charger to install and leave it connected 24/7. I've had one on my generator for five years and it starts every time.
2845	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great on my liquid filled tractor tires! The trick is to make sure your valve stem is at the 13 o'clock position (above the liquid) so you don't get much out when you check PSI.
Gave it to my brother once and he said it did not take out all the oil, I bet him that it did and he took the oil pan plug out and nothing came out. I won he lost, being younger it felt good.
6889	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber Synthetic Drying Chamois does work well and does absorb water quickly.  When try, it is very stiff and sometimes can be difficult to store.  Nonetheless, it works as advertised and we would purchase this Drying Chamois again.
8641	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	WHY I USE AN EXTRACTOR IN THE FIRST PLACE:
6790	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Recommended to me by a friend, I love it! Just like he told me, it is a little strange to use at first when it's new. After a few uses it seems to have gotten easier to dry with. Stop using microfiber towels to dry post car wash, this thing is amazing
SIDE-NOTE: When pumping up your car or truck's tires, never inflate the tire to its maximum PSI rating. Always inflate to the recommended PSI as indicated by the sticker on the driver's-side door panel. Inflating a tire to its maximum PSI will cause a tire to wear out extremely fast, and it will not perform ideally.
4924	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works fine.  I wish it were large enough to hold the vinyl cover for the shaft when the ball is on the shaft.
1446	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Tells you when you are far enough in the garage to close the door behind you. Does this by using a red light to tell you when to stop. Works great! Have 2 of these in my garage for the last 5 years with no problems.
This is actually a lot cheaper than in stores! great price!

4198	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Has an odd habit of actually rusting bolts, not sure if I actually got a bad can.
932	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I hope to never use these cables, but the construction looks just fine, and the price was quite good. I bought two sets to put one in each of my wife's and daughter's cars. I'm fairly sure that if my wife needs to use them, she will figure it out, and if my daughter needs to use them, she will find somebody who will figure it out. I do recommend buying 6-gauge or heavier cables, as these are, especially if they are copper-plated aluminum wire, as these appear to be. Aluminum has a higher resistance than copper, so the same gauge cable will conduct less current. 6-gauge should be sufficient for small and medium cars, where the starting current is not tremendously high - it may not be sufficient for large trucks or tractors, especially in cold weather. Choose your gauge carefully!
6255	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These seem to work. Don't really know but I can't complain for the price. I use them for my popup camper.

The original review follows---
This one is not going to last many years. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the foam compresses easily and the glue used to adhere the foam to the disk has issues in regard to heat. It separates and the whole thing becomes unbalanced prior to the foam detaching.

If this charger quits I would get another just like it- even unmolested its perfect. I had ordered this one thru amazonwarehousedeals- a customer return and saved a few bucks. Whoever returned this charger shoved in the box a fused, quick connect cord with clamps. A lot nicer 14ga 'free' cord, its also longer. Opened up the case and swapped in a 12" quick connect cord for the bit short single wires. Allowed me to mount the charger toward firewall and plugging in the 'free' cord gives me about 3' reach to reach battery. I removed the battery clamps and added ring terminals.
3478	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It prevented oil spill somewhat. I had to hold a 5 quart in one hand and this one the other. However, it slowing rate is too slow causing to change the oil bottle angle multiple times which as result, leaking some oil through the bottle opening.
6868	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Removes the oxidation on our RV very well.  Takes a ton of scrubbing but A+ for removing oxidation.  We purchased an extra one as our RV is 35'.  One bottle should do anything 28' or smaller.

My only complaint is that every time I use it, small red fibers fall off and get left behind on the surface, so the quality could be improved a bit. The fiber trail is terrible on the first few uses, but does get better with subsequent uses, though it will still leave some fibers behind.

3517	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great funnel. I thought this was a full sized one, over a foot big, I must not have read the description but this thing is small, maybe 8 to 9 inches.

6863	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Contemplated buying the kit since I wasn't sure it'd work for our 2004 Rockwood trailer, but I was surprised with the results. Our decals were peeling when we bought the trailer 3 years ago, I knew I'd need to remove them and replace them with newer ones, I just wasn't sure if I could get rid of the marks from the previous decals.

4474	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Not a good filter at all.  Recently took apart 5 different makes of oil filters, all similar to this.  After examining them it is apparent that Fram is not what you would think they were.  fram filters have 1/2" spaces in between the filter bends.  all the rest were nice and tight 18" or less.  also the over flow valve on the fram is poorly constructed.  most were built in to the filter but frams just sat in there along with the sealing o-ring. still doing the job but not as effectively.  An instructor told me that they put the black grippy stuff on there because it is junk metal and if you try to use a filter wrench it will rip the metal.  I can't confirm that seeing as I used fram filters for a little bit and never used a wrench to remove.  thanks to the black stuff.

2686	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing worked amazingly for some of the clogged grease fittings on my twenty-year-old Toro Proline walk behind lawnmower; I had to use it several times on some of the fittings, but they all finally came clean. I used light machine oil, but understand from some reviewers here on Amazon and elsewhere that I could have used WD-40 or even mineral spirits. It worked great for me, and I intend to use it occasionally just to keep the fittings clean, as I had ignorantly and unintentionally let some of them go too long between maintenance and discovered the hard way that machines just won't work without proper maintenance.

8437	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are the only PWC batteries I will purchase.  My first one was over three years old and still working strong when I sold my Polaris.  I purchased two used Yamahas and this was the first thing I replaced for them.  What has worked extremely well for me is installing a perko switch and turn that puppy off when you're not using the battery.  It really extends the battery life.  I use on my boat and PWCs; especially in the off season and during the winter in storage.
It's a relay, it works well. It's inexpensive.
2588	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are for a Polaris ATV and riding rough fast trails. The factory grips made blisters and I bought another set of grips and were no better. These however are great. They are a little long so when you install them be sure to push them all the way up. Very very comfortable.
I can say that it looks very nice, the color is pretty, and it is much nicer quality than the standard Club I had previously. I've also not had the stickiness problem of my last Club.

7899	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	DO NOT BUY!  Inferior mounting bolts.  Both bolts sheared off inside my block.  This may require removing the engine to extract the defective bolts.  They are NOT marine grade.  Do not buy this item.  I will be contacting Amazon and seller to file a damage claim.

8052	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	excellent product, exactly as advertised
3449	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This was recommended to us as a way to ease keeping our windshield clean when pulling a trailer. However, on first use it did a lot more for us than expected. The first time it rained after I used RainX was on a cross-country trip last week, and amazingly it almost completely eliminated the need to use windshield wipes even during downpours. Water drops still land on the windshield, but immediately rolls off whenever the car is moving, leaving a very clear view through the windshield - much clearer than even with wipers on high. For those who have flown small planes, the effect is much the same, and why such planes don't even have wipers. (At air speeds, wind pushes raindrops off the windshield very nicely all by itself.)
901	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased many air filters for my tractor over the years usually purchasing on price alone, but this Briggs & Stratton air filter is superior to the after market ones that are out there.

5243	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is great. It cleans and protects really well.  I know everyone seems to like the aerospace 303 but I find this is better.  You can feel the seats are softer after you use it.

9376	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works like a champ with a 1/2" breaker bar. Stuff some paper towels in the gap around the outside of it to hold it in place till you get the breaker wedged against the frame. I stuck a piece of pipe in a hole in the frame and wedged the breaker against that. Then you can work on the bolt without having to hold this in place. Good luck!
3867	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As described, great product.
4174	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Simply awesome!  This sprays on like a thinner oil, creeps into cracks, seams and rust, then thickens up as it sits.  The final protection is a waxy/heavy greasy film.  Spray in layers where added protection is needed.  Obviously this won't stop or reverse rust damage, but it does wonders at halting the rust in its tracks.  I use this on my classic cars to stabilize rust damage, and for this the product does an excellent job.  The only thing I wish was better was the nozzle.  It comes with a fine misty type nozzle, but for my purposes I change this out for a nozzle with a spray tube.  With a spray tube nozzle in place this can be shot deep into hard to reach places.  Other than the nozzle, the product itself works very well.
it smears your windshield like crazy.
5970	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Been using this product on the plastic windows of the soft top on our now 16 year old Mercedes SL.  It's kept those plastic windows  clean, even in the hot South where we live!  One application a year seems perfect for us.  Love this product!
8882	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked Flawlessly, my technique, not so much. When I repaint the parts of the truck in spring that I screwed up, I will buy another. I don't clean these guns at this price, they are disposable. I was spraying urethane, 55, fast reducer, 10%.

The cables are well made with the clamps firmly attached. Having the Velcro on the bag is handy for easy storage. A good product, but, hey, they're just jumper cables.

1231	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great quality oil can. So far the can does not leak. The flexible nozzle has epoxy fittings and appears well made. I have multiple quantiles and pomp everything from wd40 to 90w gear oil and it always works. If left unattended for awhile the pump will lose its prime but getting it back after a several squirts is not a big deal. The pump mechanism is all steal construction not plastic like some other designs.
GREAT QUALITY, I CAN NOT STRESS HOW GOOD THE BUILD QUALITY IS FOR THIS UNIT, I HAVE DROPPED IT THOUSANDS OF TIMES AND IT IS STILL PRISTINE.
5469	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Was really hoping for higher quality.  The chrome finish is crappy, and the end caps are cheesy.  It is functional, but cheaply made.  Go with the Rhino.
3153	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If I were a dictator (IF), I would demand everyone use rain-x on their glass windshields. It works THAT good. It's not only that it makes heavy rain bead up and roll off your windshield, but it keeps the fine spray kicked up by vehicles ahead of you from forming a sheet of water on your windshield. I have tried the spray on rain-x and it doesn't work as good as the liquid rub-on rain-x.
8403	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product and fast shipping!
The rubber guard itself btw, seems JUST a bit too short. It kind of stops leaving about a 1/16 inch of the chrome lock showing, and it often feels like it's not on well enough no matter how much you struggle with it to push it on harder. Sometimes making you think it may not be there later due to falling off when you have it attached to a bike on the back of your vehicle.

I ran it through my entire car and it performed well. I was able to vacuum up dust on the dash and steering wheel. But what I liked was that I could get the dust out of the radio buttons and air vents with the brush attachment. I didn't try the air pump capability but this could come in handy if you get a flat on the road. So It will stay in my car for sure. I grabbed some sand and threw in on the floor to demonstrate how well it vacuums for you in case you were wondering too. But overall, I do recommend this vacuum cleaner and I would purchase this again. I will update my review it quits working within a few months. But so far it seems good.

2084	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this Jan 2008 and use it every week! I keep it in the glove box of my Mazda 3. My car has tan cloth interior but the console and other parts are black. I do not have a garage and have to park my car under a tree. Every time I get in my car my black dashboard has dust on it. I love that the duster has a little plastic holder. I just open the glove box; wipe down the dashboard and other parts, and it looks new! Most dusters, the dust does not stick to them and you are only moving the dust around and you are sneezing. Somehow the dust sticks to the duster. I have bad allergies and never sneeze while cleaning with this. Just about a month ago I decided to wash it in the kitchen sink with dish soap. It washed great! I let it air dry for 2 days and then placed it back in the bag and in the glove box it went! I like to use it sometimes when I am waiting at a red light since it is very quick to clean. I have had a few passengers remark they are surprised at how well it cleans and they wanted one. One family member even bought one like mine thinking it would work, however it is not as good as this brand. Owning it for 2 and half years and still using it, I got my moneys worth! I love this duster!
4985	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the same absorber for over 10 years!  I have only used it to dry my car.  I use the absorber first to get the bulk of the water off the car then finish drying the car with a microfiber towel.  I do sections of the car with my method, not the entire car at once.  I am sure I could get by with only using the absorber but I don't to take the chance of having water spots on the car.

7551	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this Reese interchangable ball kit 12 years ago and saved lots of time and aggrevation changing ball sizes.  When I needed a Class III hitch on my new SUV I bought another Reese interchangable ball kit.  It is still being made as good or better that my first kit.
I was surprised to find it very light weight and easy to carry with the handle.  The cord doesn't fit well on the prongs on the back that it's supposed to wrap around.  However, that's a non-issue for me.  Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone who travels.  It may seem pricy, but the price saved on bringing your own drinks/snacks and the convenience are worth it if you are on the road a lot.  (I've made 6 road trips, over 1400 miles/each, over the last year and I wish I'd had this long ago.)

4170	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been working on boats for over 40 yrs. and this polish is the best so far. It is not for heavily oxidized boats just for polishing boats that aren't bad and just cleaning them up back to a high gloss. One thing I have noticed about Meguirs and some other polishes and waxes is that the plastic on the containers cracks if you drop them. So just don't drop them. The product is top notch.
6004	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this product to buff and finish my headlight after using the 3M 39045 Headlight Renewal with Protect-ant kit and the finish product was amazing. That was 2 months ago and the buff still holds. Highly recommended.
Now the cons... this net is absolutely, completely, utterly worthless for anything small or light enough it won't stay in the bed on its own.  I have a full-size (8-ft) bed, and just attempted to use this net for the first time.  The bed was full of large garbage bags full of trash, recyclables, etc.  Unfortunately the holes in this net are larger than a full trash bag.  I added 4 bungees to the net to help cover some of the bigger holes, and was still concerned I might lose part of my load.  I had to stop once to readjust, fortunately it was a fairly short drive with no speed limits over 45mph.
5939	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I didn't read enough of the description...This is a pair of vehicle side dust covers. Not sure why they'd package two of the same, but on second look the description is indeed clear. I just needed one for the trailer side. Still do.
The polisher is to be used as a second step, and finally use the wax to preserve your work underneath. I had a high end body shop for 20 years, and when I was younger I did a lot of hand rubbing in the driveway. It is a lot of work. Full blown professional polishers are for people who know how to run them. Why do I say that? Because it is necessary to learn how to let the spinning wheel scoot off the edge of a plane, rather than doing the opposite and having the wheel dig into an edge, or should I say catch an edge and burn through it. On a car if you are not careful you could destroy an antennae, or a rear view mirror. I mention buffers because they do a lot more work, a lot faster. Also using lambs wool tie on bonnets, on top of the cutting bonnet gives you mirror like results.
7202	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	You just can't ask for a better 12v fan than this.  The cable is heavy, components are well made, and for about 1 amp of current this fan really moves the air.

6834	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used to reseal the keel on my brother-in-law's aluminum bass tracker boat.  Had been fighting leaks on this boat for past three years.  He had tried some of that infomercial rubberized spray, which was totally ineffective, and various epoxies, nothing worked.. Boat shop recommended this product.  Read the online reviews and everyone seemed happy with it. In our case, we had to spend a fair amount of time prepping the surface first to remove all the other unsuccessful products.  The 3M Marine 5200 sealant goes on easy with a caulk gun, although as others have said, you need to make sure you get it where you want it, or clean up the excess with acetone right away, because once it sets up it is permanent. The product comes in three formulations with different curing times.  The version we used was the long set up time one; 24-48 hours to skin over, then 7 days to fully cure, so you can't rush the job.  Took the boat out last weekend on a shakedown cruise around the lake.  When we came back in, there was barely any moisture in the bilge.  Before using this product, we could barely get the boat in the water before the bilge pump was coming on. So far, we are very happy with the result and with this product.  Will do a follow up later on long-term durability, but highly recommended based on experience thus far.

1828	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I don't know why I waited so long to purchase the California Duster - it's been the perfect addition to keep our Airstream (outside) looking fantastic!!!  It works perfectly.  I'm incredibly picky when it comes to what gets used  on our Airstream and didn't hesitate to use this duster.  Once out of the box, I allowed the duster to settle outside for a bit as per the instructions.  It won't scratch and with the added wax (already added) it gives one amazing shine.  I'm actually looking to purchase another one for my truck - it gets pretty dusty/dirty and I would hate to use the same one for both - again, not wanting to scratch the aluminum (not that you could not). The wood handle is a nice touch, sturdy and the whole brush looks like it would last years (with proper care of course).  A definite buy !!!

13	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have come to distrust anything that plugs into the 12v car cig outlet. 99% of these small 12v appliances are too weak and too cheap. This vacuum is in the 1% of the items that actually work. We use this vac to clean out my wife's car. She has an all-you-can-eat membership to a car wash near her office, but they only wash her exterior. This vac has made it so simple for her to clean inside. She actually stores it in her car and uses it when she gets a wash during lunch. She's a tough customer, but she absolutely loves it. This is SO MUCH easier than dragging out the shop vac from the garage, and it works much better than a rechargeable dustbuster.

6774	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I did not use the polish or wax in this kit, I only used the oxidation remover. I used a random orbital to prevent any 'burn' that an amateur like me can accidentally cause. It went on fairly easy, and came off pretty easy though a clean bonnet every 6sqft makes it easier. I finished with Star Brite Premium Marine Polish and my RV looks like new!
I truly love this topside oil change unit and can highly recommend it to anyone that drives a Euro car or Chrysler crossfire) with a top mounted oil canister type filter.
7378	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I do not understand this thing at all. After soaking it in warm water and using it, it moves water around, but doesn't absorb it and certainly doesn't leave my car dry, it is also hard to move it along the surface of the car.

5029	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like it a lot i used it few times and it's great 
4133	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this to fix a tear in the valve on a blow up canoe. Worked like a charm and haven't had any issues been on the water a few times and left in shed and still holding air.
1891	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This has great reach and a heavy duty handle. The 'strings' are flimsy and shedding a bit right now. It looks like that will stop at some point though. It does do a good job. I like that it helps me reach the middle of my car since I am so short!

306	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The big stuff - I let the dealership deal with as I don't have a hoist & been living in apts with no garages - but small everyday maintenance items I'll gladly jump on - manuals like this are great to have around as a quick reference.
9195	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product.  Heats up fast.  Keeps us very comfortable on our long winter rides in our UTV.
54	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.
2269	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I am kinda surprised by all the 5 star reviews as this product has "no grit" feel to it at all.  Seriously I could use this and pleasure myself, that's how smooth and buttery it is with no grit at all to be felt.  I am not trying to be funny just don't expect this to remove anything but the finest finest of scratches and hazes.
1067	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good product and delivery!
1499	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use this as a backup power source for my pellet stove. If the power goes out when the stove is on, you get a smoky mess since it relies on a fan for combustion and exhaust. I chose to go the APC route instead of the stove-branded unit - I feel more comfortable with a company that knows this business well. I could not be happier with it - fast switching, charges the battery fast after the outage too. Ultimately simple as well - the switch is either off, or automatic or charge-only. Set it and forget it!
8398	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The powder coat is coming off and its starting to rust but it works good otherwise!
2859	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good item and I'd give it 5 star but for price.  I didn't have any choice but to pay a hefty price.
120 volt AC wiring from the inverter output leads to eight standard wall-type outlets, which are mounted on the inverter platform.
7666	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I CAN'T BELEAVE HOW WELL THIS SYNTHETIC CHOMOIS WORKS. ABSORBS A TON OF WATER, WRINGS OUT EASLY, AND NO STREAKING. CASE IS GREAT FOR STORAGE.
These special type of absorbents all give me difficulty and have yet to find the trick or the magic chamois or absorber.  This was definately not it!
4152	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for hand polishing i use 3m for machine polishing.
It seems to have been superseded by the SE-1-12S-CA.
Cons:
  I saw diffrent model and brand which seems very interesting but it sounds it can help only with GM,Ford and Chevrolet cars, here are list of cars my family and I own, 2001, VW Jetta  VR6, 2001, chrysler PT Cruisser LTD. 2004 Mercedes Benz S600, and 2006 Toyota RAV4, if this machine can not work for all the above vehicles for me it has no value since I don't want to buy 4 different one for 4 diffrent vehicle.
2317	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ok

1997	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works extremely well! Comes with it's head encased in a plastic clamshell. The handle protrudes thru a hole. I'm trying to find a large plastic bag for it.

2244	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Removes blemishes so easily. I used it on my white vehicle.  There were areas that I would rub and rub and rub using the automotive detergent. Nothing. I used a little of this rubbing compound and they were gone like that. This stuff is really really really good.

3104	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I didn't believe that you could drive in rain without the wipers after using this product, but it is true! It is specially noticeable when driving at night on a freeway at 50+ Mph. Reapplication seems to be needed after ~1 month. I used it on the inner side of windshield and it stays cleaner too.
9580	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quick and easy install on my V-10 F-250. This should save me lots of money over the life of the truck. It'll have itself paid for in with two normal filter changes.

6942	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for those trailers that have the leads too short.
7814	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Been using this for 10+ years to dry cars after washing, instead of an actual sheep skin chamois.  Can be cleaned in a washing machine.  Store damp rolled up in the plastic container to prevent drying out and hardening.  Does not mildew.  I replace it every year or two.
4008	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Best small funnel yet. Great for changing oil in a small engine. 8 more words required they tell me. Now they are controlling how I respond. Sounds like politicians to me. Doesn't take away from the great funnel though.

A specific example would be the other day I was driving up a mountain road that's notorious for these emo deer.  Lo and behold as I am rounding the corner, I see four pairs of eyes glimmering with the ambient light put off by my cars lights.  I slowed down and the whole time two of them are staring at my car, the other two off into la la land.  At the last second, one of them darts out in front of my car!  Luckily I was anticipating this and going quite slow (15mph) so I was able to avoid this Jihad-Emo Deer and save my car.

One way you can tell if it's genuine APC is if it includes instructions on how to send the battery back to APC for recycling.  I purchased my batter from "Amazon.com LLC", and it is genuine.  I removed the old battery and put the new one in, and my UPS works great now.  I expect it to last another 2-3 years.

1351	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	It's not as good as they say it is.. If u have a wide behind like me... U'll have a hard time laying down on the creeper. The head rest is very uncomfortable.. because it thugs on your hair and not much of a cushion.. The taller wheels doesn't make that much of a difference than the shorter ones I had on my napa creeper.. It still gets stuck on here and there situations.
 Well worth the money!

6809	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is a good kit and good quality products. Very happy with results. For me, the oxidation remover had to be used twice to remove my oxidation. I ended up buying the Meguiars  M6732 two step compound to complete 3 steps (oxidation &polish) for half of my camper.

4559	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This charger has been maintaining my car since the day i bought it, i plug my car in most every night to keep my system topped off, and it doesnt dissapoint.
2499	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I can speak with surety about this product because I have owned it for five years. It received very little use the first 3.5 years. It worked great the few times I used it for those years. I only had it on the hitch when towing, and I removed it once towing was completed. But then I started towing a lot and left it in place for the last 1.5 years. Recently, I needed to take it off my hitch and found the lock was seized. Nothing worked to unlock it, so I had to cut it off; a long process that I did not have time for since I was in a hurry to get on the road. Once I pulled out the pin, I saw the pin was badly rusted within the receiver. So, in 1.5 years, this lock rusted fast and became useless.

9844	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I order this for my 2013 Chevy Silverado Crew Cab 5.3L on April 24 and got it April 26. I installed it the on the 26 and drove around yesterday for about 2 hours. First I reset my on board mpg reader; it read 15.4 mpg. I checked it today and it read 16.8 mpg a difference of 1.4 mpg in my favor. With gas $3.68 a gallon it will pay off before the spring is over. So with that being said, I have to say it is all of that and some! I also noticed when I first installed it and drove off, the truck was  A LOT more responsive. I took it on the highway and punched it; WOW! That 5.3L really woke up with no hesitation. I can't see spending over $200.00 for a cold intake filter; It's not like I will be drag racing with my truck. This is a must have with a 5.3L motor and a cheap modification.
Minus one star for the neck rest disaster, other than that...very nice!
5260	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used this cleaner for several seasons and love the way it makes marks and dirty spots disappear.  I was concerned that because of the speed and performance of the cleaner that it may eventually ruin my seats but it has caused no damage to them since I have started using this product.  I definitely recommend using this to clean any vinyl seat especially boats.
4599	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great stuff does exactly what it is supposed to do.

9131	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is amazing.  I had a very old armoire with wooden drawers sliding on wooden rails, though 'sliding' is a term used loosely here, until that is I applied this wax.  I applied 2 coats of this wax, 5 days apart, to the drawers and rails.  Not only do the drawers slide in and out flawlessly, I applied the wax to all other exposed wood too and it just brought out the color, grain, and shine of the whole surface, maple I think.
It has fixed some scratched CD's that skipped too.
I hopped onto some of the fishing forums, not quite admitting that I had purposely sprayed DEET all over my fishfinder, just kinda implying that the wind took some of it while I was spraying myself (I already knew how much of an idiot I was, I didn't want to brag about it).  Several of them recommended Meguiar's #17 Clear Plastic Cleaner along with Meguiar's #10 Clear Plastic Polish.  They told me I wouldn't be disappointed.

4584	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	While restoring my 35 yrs old BMW did use several products to clean (or so I thought) the vinyl and the "shiny" look led me to believe it was clean: big mistake! I was only covering the dirt.
It cost less than the plastic alternative brand, it sturdier (no flex when standing on it) and no sharp corners to bump your shin or knee on.  And it looks great!
2997	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great buy for garage use. Not sure if I would recommend it for outdoor use because the material isn't all that tough. Either way, you can't beat the price!

3536	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's a funnel, well made, works great
1176	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I cant speak for longevity as I just received the item today, but my initial impressions are very good. The oiler is well constructed and does what it is supposed to do. No leaks or other issues. Flexible hose is very convenient. Exactly what I needed.

If you need to flare tubing, this is the tool for you.  However, if you want to do double flares, you will need adapters.  Not sure if you can buy those separately but even if you have to buy a cheap HF tool to get them, it's worth it.  Plan to put it to full use this weekend when I finish my brake line!

7708	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Say goodbye to using towels to dry your car!  Faster, easier on the finish, and way more absorbant!  This chamois cuts drying time in half.
Redid my cleaning a couple of weeks ago and while they started to fog up again I believe it was mostly from daily driving in dirt and off roading some. The second time I applied the cleaner and polisher I feel like I had a better understanding of using my buffer and did a better job of protecting the canvas around the windows (the polisher will turn your canvas white if you're not careful). The good news is I still have enough cleaner and polisher for another 2 or 3 complete cleanings.

6369	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It is marine sealant. It works.
5627	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Ok item. Compared to the harbor freight comparable...they are the same. Price is high for the level of quality.

Now we both can enjoy long drives and the music at a reasonable level.
3470	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Never used this stuff on a windshield so have no idea if it works or not. On scratched CD's, however, this stuff is magic. If you have a scratched CD or DVD skipping or erroring, apply this stuff with a cloth. It fills the scratch with a clear polymer that will bring 90% of the disks back to life. It doesn't last so use the opportunity to burn a backup and be happy.

4267	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	love this stuff - works great!!
If your headlight lenses are really bad and fogged up almost white, this probably isn't going to work for you and you'll need a complete headlight restoring kit. My lenses weren't extremely bad but this and the lambs wool bonnet really brought the clarity and shine back.

2928	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I should have done more measurements on my car.  This barely fits my 2011 Golf.  I would have gone one size higher so it can cover all the way down to the wheels.  Happy with the quality of this cover. Car is already under a covered car port, so I can't say how it does in direct sunlight and rain.  It does keep my car protected from the errant garden sprinklers nearby.

894	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	bought it before and will buy  it again fits and works as it should
8330	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I looked at all the other mirrors advertised and reviewed.  Most mirrors are for cars and are made out of plastic with a reflective coating and don't give a great image. I believe this mirror might actually made of glass.  I don't know if mirrors for cars cannot be made of glass due to regulations but I guess it does not apply to this product because it is for a boat.  I use it in an RV because the RV has no rearview mirror.  I needed a way to keep and eye on the kids without turning around.  The field of view is perfect.  The suction cup worked perfect and stayed on the windshield even when left up for several weeks.  In side the accordian rubber boot is a series of nuckles to get the perfect bend and you can tighten the nuckles if you you need to. Over all this mirror worked perfect.  Not only is this a value, but I could not find another mirror at any price that would do what I needed to do.
1207	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing was great. Worked exactly how it was supposed to work. I filled it just a bit. And it did its magic. I was able to fix the tin man right up and got him a one, two stepping. The flexible head on this is great and allowed me to reach in areas I would have not easily reached. The quality of this product also feels good.

7320	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well
4194	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I really like this stuff.  I have quite a few old iron things that don't get used much in my barn.  When I put them away, I spray them down with this stuff and they do not rust.  I love the smell of it too.

2089	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Item looks very nice, but is not functional. The metal is almost as thin as paper. There are 2 seperate top pieces for ashtray. There are 4 tiny holes that each of the top pieces of the ashtray fit into. When you push on the release to dump ashes, the top pieces pop out of their holes and fall into the ashtray with all the ashes creating a big mess. You have to dig thru ashes and cigs to fish out the top piece and re fix it in holes again. This item had 2 glowing reviews is why I bought.....must be from people who make or sell these. Product is junk!
6603	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my boat and it all works great. I've used more expensive brands in the past and these are better. A little goes a long way too. It's everything you need in one great set. Great price too
197	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this manual to do a head gasket replacement on my 1999 Wrangler. Haynes was always the resource for serious mechanics many years ago but that has obviously changed. Trying to pack to many vehicles in to one manual is a bad idea for starters. My biggest complaint is that once I had my engine back together I put on a new distributor, rotor, wires and plugs. According to the manual the #1 plug is located in the back. That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and didn't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual. After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers. The first thing I found was several references to #1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been. After 2 minutes to switch the wires around the Jeep fired right up and sounds good. How can you publish a manual with a major error like that?
Definitely would buy again!

2748	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Fits my car well.  I use bungee cords to hold it in place on windy days.  While it is not the best quality, it's okay and lasts about a year, maybe two, before developing rips or tears in the fabric due to our erratic and everchanging weather.  For the price, it's worth it because I can't afford a couple hundred dollars for one of the best covers.
5841	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It is nice to protect and electrical grease the trailer connectors.

1573	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a GMC Acadia, which is a fairly large, wide, high SUV. I needed something that would reach across the roof and the hood. This wash stick did the job.

5942	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great, very snug on the connector.  Why they send two I am not sure??? As other reviewers have pointed out you cannot put the other one on the trailer side, this is only a cover for the vehicles plug.  But I didn't need a trailer side cover, so I have an extra.

Back then, I had purchased my first new car and decided to try rain-x after seeing a promotional display (convinced by the marketing claims imprinted on the box).  After the first application, there was a hazy glaze on the windshield and other glass surfaces I had applied rain-x on.  The haze dissapeared after turning the windshield wipers on for a couple of minutes.

5277	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I've been looking for something that replaces a natural chamois for awhile, I like the idea of a washable chamois, but this left a thin sheen of water behind which left the glass streaky.  It also went moldy when left damp.  Dried out it seems fine for other jobs, but not what I had hoped.
6193	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what it claims to do!

Update- The two vehicles are still looking good nearly a year later and no sign of yellowing or fogging. The really bad one has started to get worse again, the plastic is broken down. I plan to wetsand that one soon, but it is still better now than before treatment.
2346	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I performed this installation in my 2004 Jeep TJ in 4 hours start to finish. This included online research at bulldogsecurities.com for the vehicle specific wiring colors. My jeep was a bit easier than some cars and trucks since it doesn't have power or remote door locks or a security system. All I wanted was a remote start system (that's why I chose the simplest remote starter Bulldog offers). The installation manual is a bit overwritten leaning to a beginner but the kit is complete with everything you will need except for a screwdriver and a roll of double face tape to mount the box. It even includes a razor knife and a test light (I never used either one). It worked as advertised and was easy to program. I recommend anyone interested in buying one of these to visit the manufactures website and view the installation video and vehicle specific info prior. This is not an installation for everyone, and the video will allow you to decide if you want to tackle this yourself or have a professional install it for you.

I was very impressed with it right out of the box. It is super easy to use. Just plug it into your cigarette lighter and you are ready to go.

I also was surprised to see the nice carrying case for it, making sure it is protected and easy recognizable when you need it.

4747	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to maintain a battery in a "farm truck" and it has worked perfectly for 2 years and still going strong. This is kept under the hood, with the power cable sticking out from the grille and is constantly subjected to moisture, extreme heat and dirt, and keeps on happily charging. Built extremely well.

6318	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Product is made of durable plastic.  I've used them a couple of times and they work as advertised.  I bought two of them, one for each wheel.
Update: 9/18/2015  These work so well that I purchased two more.  These move a lot of air even at low and are so much quieter than than anything else I have tried.  I'm using these in my off grid /off road camper.  I plug them into an ARK Pak and they run for a week.

1008	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	What an absolute piece of garbage. You won't be thinking about the money you wasted on this thing as hot oil comes splashing over the "chicken wire" mesh that sits under the large cover. Yes, the "chicken wire" can be removed, perhaps by just touching it and then the whole thing falls into the hot oil, but then you have a large area to drop the drain plug into, The side spout leaks and if you try to tighten it too much, it will pop back out, ditto for the top lid. Oh, by the way the top lid leaks a little bit, too, but if you're taking this thing full of oil somewhere, you better put it into a leakproof container....inside of another leakproof container - and maybe the place will throw the whole piece of junk out for you.

4589	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the most useful gadgets to have.  I one mounted on a portable generator and another under the hood of my motor home.

Have had one of these chargers in use for over 2 years - still working fine.
7274	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I use it for keeping my kids cool in the boat.  Pushes a lot of air.  I have never used it on the high setting because low and medium do the trick.  It also does NOT kill my marine battery after a couple of hours of use.  The only downside so far is the "feet" to steady the fan are not quite large enough to balance when a decent group of waves hit the boat.  I would definitely buy again.
It ships via Prime
We recommend this to any battery power travelers.
And they had no shipping charges if added onto an existing Amazon order.
As such, it's the "almost" perfect creeper for me.  Being Made in the USA is just icing on the cake!
Cons:
3944	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	This lock did not work as the feed through hole for stud is way to small for any stud that I have ever seen. Very cheaply made for being a master lock
It goes on similar but when it dries it is very hard to buff off
This thing does its job.

2295	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I have used these before and been happy with them, but this one didn't work when I first got it out of the box.  I tapped it a few times on the tailgate and then it started to work.  I'm sure on a gasoline vehicle with a stock exhaust it would be fine but it's far too quiet for my super duty.  Installed a WOLO beeper for less than 12 dollars from amazon and works much better.
1016	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Why would anyone make an oil drain pan with a spout that is flush with the top rim?  That's not a spout.  Unless you pour the oil out of this thing at a ridiculously slow rate, the oil just flows over the sides and misses whatever you are trying to pour the oil into.
Not much more I can say, at least Amazon took it back.
2510	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	These are a bit different than the photo.  Have a thicker housing and additional wording on the top plate that is not appealing to me.

Now I have a tall and short ball mount with interchangeable ball sizes, so I can town almost any trailer I need to.
The cuffs at the wrists are crazy-huge.  When strapped down to their smallest size the cuff is still waaaay bigger than my entire fist. Very unusual fit.  No way to get a tight fit around any wrist.

1184	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This little can I great. Doesn't leak or drip so for the price you can't beat it. Hey it's an oil can what else can I say but it shoots oil.
I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper. I would buy another one if I needed it :)
2817	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great so far
I erased the code and all is well.
In Reality, once you open the package ( also printed in the package ) . . . it only has coverage Up to $500.00, and the limited warranty is only 90 days from the date of purchase. * The one year guarantee is good for one year IF you have COMPREHENSIVE insurance coverage. I guess people that only carry liability coverage are out of luck.

Several times I've given myself a gentle push and gone shooting underneath the entire length of my car. I'm 210 pounds and this creeper supports me without an issue.
2471	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I would love to cut this unit in two, because I have a hunch it's a lot softer metal than is actually required.  But for carrying keys and a couple of bucks in the receiver guard, it's probably fine.  I wouldn't use one of these for anything important unless I had an idea how fast it could be cut by a diamond wheel mounted on a high speed rotory air tool.
This is foam so that is normal.  If you polish you vehicle often enough this is all the speed you will need.  Always wash pad after use and let dry so you will need more than one if you are doing more than one vehicle..  Have done three vehicles with no problems washing pad after each vehicle.

Even though he kept the boat wiped down and occasionally use cleaner the seats were in bad shape.  I was working with the DA on the outside, and he was using the M39 on the inside.

If you cannot find a size that matches your brand new car, then search for the same make and model of car, but one year old. I had to do this to find a match for my ride.
Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water.  Need at least a second try.  I detailed the clean with a nice towel "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3" I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight.

Brought this hoping for a quick and cheap solution to fogging headlamp problem.  Applied per instructions and it just cleaned the lenses but did not remove most of the fog.  It is similar to the old turtle wax with a little bit of abrasives in the solution - cleans but not abrasive enough to take out the haze.  A waste of money.  I will try some chrome cleaner or silver polisher next.  If that doesn't work, will just order replacement headlamps from Amazon.com; which is about 2x the price of the more expensive haze/fog removers.  And those may not work either.
UPDATE, JULY 2017: After more than four years of regular use, my Absorber is performing as good as the day I bought it. Impressive! It's a little dirtier now, of course, but it's still working perfectly. I sure wish I had a product like this 25 years ago!

6479	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I read the reviews on this product and decided to get one for my husband.  He has always been a leather chamois user.  When he tried it, he was very happy with it and said he plans to continue using these from this point on.
Fabric tore on day one.
6715	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked well, along with a Porter-Cable buffer to remove serious oxidation from the gel coat finish on our travel trailer, and then restore a bright shine.
For those that are adding to a Whaler, the knobs from the factory are black with black indicator (not clear). These have the clear indicator to allow indicator lights mounted behind to show. A simple add of the black with black indicator knob (elsewhere on Amazon) and I had a nice clean row of switches that looked totally factory matching the original in place.
2482	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good product


6452	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect
9625	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been using kn products since way back in the 70s and 80s great product. some mechanics don't like them but to me they are time tested
9532	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent

5928	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Came with the grease. Just put half in each cap then install. Straight forward. Pay attention to how you install as one end has a little pocket area to slide the terminal in. If you have just a little bit of common sense, you'll be able to successfully install this product.
It looks like it would be a really good design but the top cover and side spout both leak like mad! Due to the warping that occurs with bare plastic to plastic, you can't get a good seal.
I washed mine in the washing machine and just put it damp back in the tube. Got all of the black dirt streaks off.  Looking forward to using it for a long time.
5965	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great on our 175 Optimax Pro XS.  Just what we needed to keep our prop secure
602	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a good product, it's much wider than the backing pad to allow use at an angle as well as more surface area. The wool is thick and cuts well. About the only draw back to this is that it will throw off A LOT of lint, at least with the first use. This is common with wool pads though. I don't regret this purchase at all, but think that I will use foam next time to save myself the mess of all that lint. Made in USA
3084	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	excellent product
4641	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Get this for vinyl cleaning, havn't found a better cleaner except gas
*NOTE: I use the cleaner and oil very liberally and one recharger kit has lasted me to my third one which I am doing right now. I still have enough for one more "less liberal" recharge for next time. Also, to thoroughly oil the filter in its grooves, it takes a little patience but again, it's well worth it. Time to go finish my recharge! Take care and I pray this helped!
3652	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this with the polish and compound that Meguiars makes to remove the oxidation on my 5th wheel and really did a good job. As with all their products follow their instructions and you will be happy with the results. This si the first time I have used their wax and am hopeful that the results are long lasting. As always with Amazon the shipping was right on time and a good price.
4363	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works
636	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought these cables for my daughter's car.  I am not going to get into the whole "gauge and cladding" argument.  I am just going to say this:  These cables will jump off whatever vehicle you need to jump.  That simple.  Done.
3742	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good tankyou
6343	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent spark plugs. These are the same NGK spark plugs that you might purchase from your local motor cycle shop at a greatly reduced rate. Prompt delevery. I would definitely recommend this product and company for its high quality service.
1226	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It pumps oil. Well built. Will buy more.
7304	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The title says it all.
8463	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have two Audis and use this for every oil change. Pump it walk away and come back. Simplifies oil changes!!
1393	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very good buffing for the 'Final polishing!
2. It circulates a lot of air considering its small size.
419	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	love it on the van looks good
1871	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love it.
I have used them for years but they DO have an Expiration Date on them... Safety in case they dry out! Excellent for Wheel Chocks in the Garage Too. It grips the concrete and Larger Tires very well.
8307	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	it sucks as advertised
4259	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	work great

5215	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent chamois!  I have used many different kinds, in fact my last purchase from Amazon included this one as well as a fancy one with a waffle pattern design.  Let's just say that this outperformed that other one and I am confident in saying that this does just as good of a job as a leather one, without the process of breaking it in.  This is a great deal for the price.  Great for after washing your car or after a heavy rain.
This fan is not necessarily for "cooling off" on a hot day in your camper van or RV: it's best suited for creating air flow -- especially when used in conjunction with the Fan-tastic rooftop vent.
Should have sent me a larger lock for the u-bolt you sent; and maybe one with a swivel washer of some sort.  Then again, maybe there's something I don't know.

3483	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice product

6615	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good product
3574	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Did a great job
7926	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I cracked the one on my boat trailer, but was able to get the part # off the glass.  My trailer is about 8 years old, so this was an exact replacement for the one I broke.  The newer wesbar lights under this model # are different and although would have worked, it wouldn't have been exact.
5914	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great product
86	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great
3713	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I installed this to operate Head Lights for a subcompact Tractor. Good construction for outdoor environment..  Good current rating.  Good value for the money.
4384	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Now I have 6 of them- one on each vehicle and a spare charging up a spare battery in the garage!  No problem- works well and very economical
Florida summer storms knocked out all power for an hour, and ALL computers in the house successfully shut down and were protected by the APC software. I was relieved that it saved my work and shut down all of my computers!!
7914	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Did what it was supposed to do, no issues.
8498	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Working great on a 2006 Toyota Prius and 2007 FJ Cruiser
8793	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	It was missing the hose, but I didn't realize it right away because I didn't winterize within the 30 days, so I had to buy another cheaper one just to get the hose.
Tennis ball and a string is still more reliable!!
1078	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Very good
5020	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have two long-haired giant schnauzers and use these for drying them off. They're so much better than normal towels; they dry far better and take up a fraction of one towel in the wash. I will be ordering more to make swamp-cooler jackets for the dogs, since they love to go with us outdoors during the Florida heat and have black hair/fur.
8306	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Can't believe this isn't standard on every boat.
7904	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works great.
3017	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	just what i wanted
3246	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Accurately described in the advertisment.  Selection of the correct fit was easy to follow.  Fits the car, does the job intended. Speedy delivery too.
9841	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've used K&N filters for over 15 years.  I trust them and they are very cost effective.  Get one and start saving money.
8743	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	perfect replacements for the factory originals.

Other things to consider:
1582	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great!
This one arrived in a padded envelope, which the threaded shaft and then poked though, exposing the threads. These were backed around a bit in shipping requiring a bit of work to get it to fit the buffer. So, packaging, minus 1 star but the disappointment did not end there.
Thanks
Second, the dog hair does not weave itself into the Absorber like it does on towels.  And any hair on the Absorber is easily rinsed right off, fast!
6031	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Let me first be clear that the Everglass filler itself it top notch and works beautifully. I've relied on this product many times in the past and will continue to use it in the future.
2505	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I got these for my Silverado Pickup. They look good and work well. They are not spring loaded which would have been nice. You pull them up and they lock in place. Installation was very easy and they have a clean look.
4202	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The product is great, but the aerosol makes a mess all over the can and your hands when spraying.  I recommend buying a gallon and a decent manual spray bottle and doing it the old fashioned way.
2643	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What did I before I had this thing?! I feel like it saves my life everyday that I work. I own a small lawn care and landscaping company.
6628	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I put this on the front hatch of my boat and it works great.

4466	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What can one say about an oil filter other than it seems to be working well and I am happy with Fram.

9207	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This blanket works great. It does not get hot and is not meant to. But it puts out enough heat that it keeps my wife comfortable which is saying something, as she is always cold. I highly recommend it.
8560	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works exactly as advertised with no issues. I use it to change oil in my Honda Jetskis and it gets the job done in a quarter of the time it used to take.
2585	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the real deal - not cheap, but works as well or better than expected!  I installed on a stand-pipe, outside of my tank, so didn't need the Telescoping Suction Pipe.
1242	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent little oil can, and MADE IN AMERICA too!  Works really well.
3662	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Picture is accurate.  I  use this for filling Subaru's with automatic transmissions, power steering pump reservoirs and adding fuel tank additives,
All that being said I chose to keep this overpriced fan because I like the 12V motor and fan blades. It is relatively quiet on both low and medium speeds and blows a decent amount of air. It's 2016 and you still don't have many choices with this type of fan so this will have to do =\
7041	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Delivered as promised, would use again.
3572	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Did a great job on my boat!  Better that the Meguiar's car product I used before.

3419	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've never bought metal polish before so I cant compare this to another brand. I used it to shine up the 1963 Gillette Slim Adjustable safety razor that I bought on Ebay. It was in good condition but the metal was dull, but this made it shiny and it looks like its new. The coating has also lasted me about a month of shaving with the razor and has yet to wear off. Its non toxic so its safe to use on my razor.
1201	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Looks great, operates excellent and doesn't appear to leak
5066	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great
7962	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	convenient, well made, liked mine so well, I bought one for my dad
8831	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It gets the job done.  For the price, this seems like the best deal.  Haven't had any problems.
2058	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I gotta have one for each rig, love these.
- cheaper than chamois
6949	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this to replace faulty wiring on my golf cart trailer. Still works great after several months of use.
5295	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised, I used it to dry my car after a wash.  I haven't tried to wash it in the washing machine yet, so I might adjust the rating after i try it.
9237	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	work real good , when snowing or pushing snow I own 3

I could see myself owning this puller for a very long time.  It was more expensive than the others, but one of the best available on Amazon.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a dent puller that will last them for years.  In this case, you really get what you pay for.
764	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Lomanco F0510B2497 Exactly Replaces older F0510B2944 on 6/2011 just 2 days prior to a heat wave in NYC.  Attic fan needed to lessen work load of central air conditioning attic heat exchange unit.  My older attic fan (installed around 10/2002) burned out after 9 years of service.  Confirmed live circuit and dead old motor; **Powered off circuit** ; removed old motor with fan assembly from attic fan mount - retested old motor again and confirmed dead; new motor tested OK pre-install; uninstalled BX cable cover and existing fan blades from old motor and reinstalled to this new motor onto attic fan mount(fan, cable cover, and fan mounting all fit perfectly); powered up circuit and all tested OK.  New motor works as it should.  ** Make sure the attic fan thermostat is set properly so the fan will cycle on and off with attic temperature needs! (Constant Off = hot attic = load on AC = less efficiency with higher electrical cost;  Constant On for 24/7 May possibly wear out motor prematurely - unnecessary electric cost.) **
2693	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product nice wight and durability
2774	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits a 2016 Nissan Maxima PERFECTLY! Just fold those side mirrors.
2800	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as advertised. Easy to install.
6053	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought and used this on faded black plastics on my car. Works great and brought back the color and works well on headlight capsules too!
3482	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I lake.
4. Don't wet the absorber and put it back in the tube no matter what the directions say. Hang it over something, such as a towel rack, and let it dry. When you need to use it again, just drench it with water until it softens, wring it out, and you're good to go.
seller does not warranty unit, manufacturer phone # is disconnected. POS, save your $
6333	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It's a spark plug.  Nothing special.  The best part is that it was cheaper than any of the auto parts stores, and it was delivered to my door.
4015	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great.  Noticed a difference while working it into the surface.  Dries quickly so I used a detail spray to help get it off.
3159	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A good car cover. Car is usually garaged, but use when away from home and around trees that drop sap and pollen all over the finish.
8640	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Performes great and I had no problems changing oil in equipment I wish that I had spent money on this years ago.

8370	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	this oil is great, it  has protected my teak patio chais ,chairs,table, for 3 years now it is much better than the hardware brand, thanks great product!
2908	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well to keep my summer car protected in my garage over the winter months. Very light weight but does the job, easy to install and the elastic helps keep it in place.
1966	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works really well!
I got the package in the mail today, and immediately took the #17 to the fishfinder screen with a clean white washcloth and started rubbing it in.  For the first few minutes, I thought I had wasted $25, but after about 5 minutes of rubbing the cleaner in (with only a few drops applied every 90 seconds or so) it was obviously working well.  A firm, quick buffing action, alternating between little circles and up-down, left-right motion, and in about 7 minutes that screen looked like it had just come out of the box.
6488	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Much much stronger than silicone
3354	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what you'd expect.
8318	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I actually use this on my boat. It gives a wide range view (like a right side mirror) and allows me to see behind my boat while
3531	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product.  Works!!
5701	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Far better than any Armor All that I have used on exterior plastics. Depending on age and damage, results will vary and more regular application may be required. I have no doubt that used on a new car, this will vastly improve the condition and appearance of exterior plastic trim over the life of the car.
-3 jaw puller
but when you go to wring it out the shear size (25"x36") made it very hard to get a good wring out.
I have a wood stove in my work / storage trailer and having the fan to quickly circulate the air when it gets to warm is just as nice as using
3191	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Does what it says.
4673	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to charge a vehicle stored outdoor with an extension cable 25' from Schumacher that Amazon suggested. as frequently bought together..BUT  the charger  doesn't have a connector for the extension cord , just the  hardwire terminals.  Also the owners manual says do not expose to rain-  hard to thing of a rainier environment  than a vehicle driving at highway speeds in the rain and this is supposed to be  mounted under the hood, not totally out of the weather by any means. So I decided to put it on my tractor in the barn and  get an indooor charger from Schmacher for the outdoor vehicles
2284	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the first car cord I've seen with selectable voltage outputs.  The included array of connectors make this a must-have for anyone using multiple electronic devices in the car.  And cheap, too.  Just be sure to set the voltage and polarity correctly. Recommended.
6636	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well



8628	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	makes changing your oil a lot less messy. thick plastic with quality fittings will make this thing last for a long time.
2835	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Looks good and seems to be doing what it's suppose too.

6375	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good product.

3205	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is pretty handy.  It is angled perfectly to remove the hubcap.  And, it's actually pretty solid.  So, it's easy to pound them back on.
1758	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice duster and sure makes cleaning the car easy when there is no time to wash.
NOCO Genius GCP1 Black 13 Amp 125V AC Port Plug
47	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This review is for a Car Vacuum Cleaner that is DC12-Volt 106W. This portable handheld vacuum can handle both wet & dry  with the 16.4FT(5M) Power Cord that it comes with. It also tucks away into a nice compact blacl carry bag with zipper.
Their may be more pricey  3M products that may cut the oxidation better, faster .............but my experience is with this product. If you have very heavy oxidation you may have to go over a section over a few times to cut and remove years of neglect. But if Gel coat is still good and you want to restore your RV keep at it, Its not an easy job. But if you had someone do it for you its could cost you a couple thousand to do it right. Its a long process . But you can achieve the end result with right high speed machine, right pad not to burn and right kind of Compound. More so the time to keep at the job.
291	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	good info
7423	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Easy install with the split tail light wiring
6390	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Makes drying off newly washed vehicles a breeze. Constantly using it on all of our cars in the family. Would recommend.
9882	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got these for my new-to-me 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche.  They great and do not move once placed.  I also bought the rear set.  They seem to keep all the dirt in place and are easy to shake out.  Definitely recommend.
Leave it outside in the sunlight too often and it will crack in your hands and break up
9722	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What an improvement it made when I switched from the paper filter to the K&N filter truck breath better you can hear the difference now my next installation will be the K&N Blackhawk cold air intake kit thanks K&N for making great products 
911	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I called local mower equipment place and got a price on carb kit. I looked on Amazon and ordered enough stuff to get free shipping and got carb kit, this filter and one other thing for less than the price quoted for just the carb kit at local dealer.
3085	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works well
My headlights had a slight grey haze along the top 2inches of the plastic headlamp cover.  Be sure that your haze is not interior condensation as this compound will do nothing to fix that.  One quick test would be to rub a wet cloth across it.  If the haze turns clear it's exterior.  I used this product on a 2011 Lexis IS250 so the lenses weren't so old that they had become yellowed.  I'm not sure if this product is "robust" enough to repair lenses that bad.
8235	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years. I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out. You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed. Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED.
5765	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good product!  Having both the tail and brake light is great and it really dresses up an otherwise empty receiver hitch.
Overall, I am pleased with this product and hope that it lasts for a long time.  I will come back and update this review over time as I learn more about it.
3743	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quick delivery, great product for a great price.

453	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great sticker
9837	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent buy. Popped off the Torx screws from air box yanked, out the paper filter, slapped this one in, screwed it back in and it's good to go. Way better throttle response and sounds like a real truck although it runs on gas.
8443	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This battery fits perfectly in my 1999 SeaDoo GTX Limited and spins the starter like my older battery could not. Seems to maintain its full charge with no problems. Costs double the standard battery so I'll need 2 or 3 years of satisfactory service for it to be a good deal.
581	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	EXCELLENT PRODUCT
207	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	ok
3760	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Used this refill the transmission fluid in my V6 Accord which has a filler bolt on the top of the tranny case. Would be better if it was a bit longer, as the case is towards the bottom of the engine bay. There are bigger funnels, but I chose this one as it's narrow and easy to snake through lines, hoses and wiring.
4387	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I own this model charger and it does a great job keeping the battery in my truck (drove seldom) in fully charged form and prevents dead cells by keeping the battery charged. Not only does a battery run down when it is not constantly charged but it also dramatically shortens the life of the battery by destroying the plates within. A note of caution, when in stalling this onboard unit, it would be wise to add a inline 20 amp fuse onto the positive (red wire) of the unit just in case a short circuit develops within the unit or your vehicle. Hey, this upfront precaution is better than a fried electrical system or fire. The fuse and holder can be purchased right here on AMAZON. It would be convenient to order both at the same time plus any splicing materials etc. Make all connections tight and wrap with plastic electrical tape.


3057	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product and it works
9198	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The Hopkins Deer Alert DOES make deer look at your car. I tested it by driving near a city park where deer were calmly browsing, their heads down. I pulled up, waited a few moments, flipped the switch, and within a couple seconds all 5 deer lifted their heads and looked directly at me perhaps 75 yards away. I have not so far seen deer "running away" when they hear the chirping of this device. Today there were two deer on the side of the road as I approached at about 60mph. I saw them raise their heads and watch me drive by. So I don't expect this device to SCARE or REPEL deer, but I believe it does get their ATTENTION which in many cases may help avoid a collision. I suspect the effectiveness of this device is diminished on very windy days or in especially noise environments, and if you come over a hill and deer are right there in the middle of the road, you're probably still going to have an incident as they wouldn't have time to hear the chirping and react. But I believe this device will help reduce the risk of car-deer collision.
1292	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Once again, a great product.  I keep coming back for a reason.
That said, the user manual is one of the most confusing and complicated I have encountered -- especially for a fairly simply item. The instructions seem to indicate that you may need to clean this every 24 hours and then let another 24 hours pass to dry out. And there are many thingd that may void any warranty offered.
9006	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Not to many people use the club like they use too but I will take the extra peace of mind of protecting my car any day.  I love the fact that this comes in blue.
1660	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	OK
8702	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This was the perfect mirror for us.  Great price and it worked great out on the water.  Very easy to set up and change around for the perfect fit.
6508	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Best product for drying your car
1. There are little brackets to mount it on a cage.
4010	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Gee, I like the color and it's a funnel.  It works just as advertised and it showed up four days before the produce got here.
5000	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great condition, I am happy I purchased this item.
9393	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect. Used it twice over a year. Hasn't rusted. I keep it in the clamshell in came in. Did the job without slipping on a 2001 D17A1 and an 02 D17A2.
It's a pity because the swivel head is a great idea.
1488	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Haven't used this yet, but I am confident that it will serve my needs if I need to jump start a vehicle in very bad weather from the vehicle interior  with it and the Allstart Tools 555 Camo Pro Pac Battery Jump Starter with AC Inverter I purchased at the same time.

8695	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is BIG! It works great though
2518	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is definitely the right tool for the job. Who would have thought "versatality" would be an adjective to describe a simple anchor point?  I love the way these pull up and push down and click into place. A couple of mine are a bit tough to raise and lower, but I always carry a 10-in-1 tool with me for just such a purpose and strong-arming them up into place.  other than that...no problems at all. They have held up well for a couple of years now. pretty easy to install. I had to buy 6 which got a little expensive, but I have no regrets.
The tongue of the carrier fits reasonably tightly into my 2" receiver but has a little bit of give to it - hopefully this will be taken up by the hitch pin and clevis pin (which aren't included with the carrier).  I plan on using this to move a moped and it looks like it should handle the job easily.  It seems to be pretty true to the description of how heavy the carrier is - relatively easy for me to put on the carrier by myself.  I plan on getting some reflective tape to put around the edges of the carrier.

8578	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I used this to change the oil in our jetskis back when we had them. Made it possible for me to change it myself and not have to pay a ton for a dealer to do it. The two flaws that stand out to me (and prevent me from giving full five stars) are the very small tube which makes the evacuation project slower and the fact that the top vacuum pump is not permanently attached. There is already a spout to dumb out the oil on the side. Why have the pump not attached? It just makes it more difficult to keep the pump from loosing vacuum.
When done for the day we place them in the trailer.

The only issue is that every time the lock is unlocked there's a chance that The numbers from the combination mechanism could fall out an all get lost. So you have to hold them in place with your hand every time the thing is unlocked.

To prep the tire, I usually use a piece of small sand paper (the scuff plate works fine, but I prefer sand paper). Make sure the tire is dry and clean after sanding flat. I then add a small amount of air to the tube to mimic the size of the tube when its in the tire (not necessary, but I figure this helps the patch not ripple and leak). After, I add the patch, sealing the hole.

After its field test, I was very happy with the performance of this funnel.  The long neck is especially useful for keeping some separation from the fill hole and pouring location.  That is essential for ensuring a safe fill.  I used it for both gas and oil, wiping it down between one and the other.  I will say that it is a bit tough to wipe inside the long neck, but nothing a twisted paper towel couldn't handle.  I store it with a paper towel crunched in both ends to keep dirt out.  When ready for use I pull them out, wipe the outside and I'm ready to go!

2540	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Somehow I thought the bin would be bigger, but as long as it holds 2-3 bags of fertilizer I am happy.  I have a Polaris Sprortsman 570  that I installed a rear brush guard on, so mods were necessary for the install since the guard prevents mounting the plate on on the rear rack.  I had a choice of getting larger U bolts for the 2" brush guard, or drilling...I chose drilling for a more stable, better looking permanent mount for the plate.  I centered the mounting plate on the brush guard using the lowest two holes on the plate, marked and drilled through the brush guard with a 5/16 bit then mounted the plate using two and a half inch grade 8 carriage bolts, nuts, washers and lock washers.  To solve the tipping/leaning issue other reviews commented about when the bin is full of heavy material, I removed the bolts holding the top metal band on the bin and replaced them with 3/8 eye bolts, then used a pair of 6' 400lb-rated ratchet straps hooked through the eye bolts and rear rack to pull tension on the top of the bin (before loading with material) to add extra stability (you can get a pair of them here on Amazon...Keeper 03720 Camouflage...for less than $13).  Trim the strap length for a custom fit then just store them in the bin with the pins used to secure the broadcaster to the mounting plate when off the quad. (By the way, I tried bungee cords first and found that they just did not provide the stability I was looking for, so went with the ratchet straps.)

4687	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Recently had my car painted and when they sanded the old paint off down to the metal they got red paint dust all over the inside of the car. This cleaner was great in removing the red tint all over the inside of the car. The stitching on the door panels and seats was red. Using a tooth brush with this cleaner cleaned the stitching  up. Since this dries flat and not slippery I will keep using it for my rubber floor mats. To finish off the inside of the car and to provide UV protection I then went over everything with Meguiars #40 Vinyl and Rubber cleaner. The #39 is a heavy duty product.  My go to product for regular maintenance will be the #40.

6091	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It works pretty well for me and is easy to use.  It does need to be applied and then buffed off properly.  It is not expensive, so it is worth trying.  From what I have heard, headlights can also be fogged on the inside, and of course it would not help for that.  Consumer Reports says that the Sylvania and 3M restoration kits are the best, so I may try one of those.  The Meguiar's is cheaper, easy to use and definitely worth a try.  I use one lint-free cloth to apply it and a clean one to buff it.

2402	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Went into place perfect, easy to install. Could have installed it with one person, but If you have someone willing to take 10-30 minutes with you then it'll go faster. To prevent rusting, corrosion, and the screws stripping (like my basket screws stripped. I did everything correct and they still stripped, called Yakima and they sent more screws out free of charge right away. So my project was delayed a week) I put spray on it to prevent any of that happening to my extension. I camp, bike, and enjoy everything about the outdoors. This basket extension will help get my bike from point A to point B with no trouble at all! No more scratching up the inside of my Forester. :)

8177	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I have had this cargo holder for over a year now.  When I first started using it, I kept it in the cab when not in use, it worked great and was easy to ratchet.  However, (and I'm glad I didn't review this earlier) I got a new truck and there was no room in the cab, so I left it installed in the bed.  Well, needless to say, I can no longer get it to ratchet without great effort.  I'm a small woman and it's absolutely no use to me anymore unless I've got a muscle man available to open and shut it for me.  Yes, I've tried lubricating it, but no go.  Oh, and the cargo separator bar (by another company) WILL NOT work with this model.  So, today, I'm ordering the more expensive type and hope it works.  Good luck if you decide to save the $7 and order this one.

6695	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very useful cloth, but I primarily use mine to dry my vehicle so I don't get water spots. I have used these with hot weather motorcycle riding. I would wet one, wring it out, then put it on top of a wicking tshirt (which would wet as well), and then zip on a mesh textile jacket over it. As I rode the evaporation would dry the towel and the tshirt, and would cool me off. My only negative is that I have had little success cleaning these once they get dirty/stained; I just buy new ones every couple of years.

9132	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I use Johnson Paste Wax in my wood shop. Here's how I treat my cast iron table saw and band saw exposed surfaces to prevent rust. After cleaning the table I apply a liberal amount of BoeShield T9. Following the T9 I apply a healthy dose of Johnson Paste Wax. After it has had a few minutes to haze up, I rub it off by hand. I have heard of others using an electric buffer like you would use for a car, but I find a soft towel by hand to be sufficient. I immediately re-apply the Johnson Paste Wax and repeat the process. Let it haze and buff.

2552	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I used it for a fueling station on a travel trailer project.  Works very well, and these are a lot more reliable than the cheesy fueling stations that come with most toy boxes.  It pumps fuel really fast, so you have to be careful with the smaller quads.  It would be nice if the hose was a little stiffer, and more kink resistant like the hoses you see at gas stations.  It is a little noisy though.

6771	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	We have a Fan-Tastic fan in our RV bathroom and this is either another company or simply JUNK.  Yes, it blows air but even on the very lowest setting but it is LOUD.  To compare, we have an inexpensive ($15?) Honeywell Turbo fan that is 1/2 the noise on its highest setting!  May keep it for a dire emergency but I think we are going to look for another option (maybe a converter so our batteries can run the Honeywell fan if we do not have shore power).  This is tops a $15 fan and miserable to be around.

7366	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I worked as a summer camp counselor for 11 weeks in central Texas this last summer where there was no air conditioning in the cabin.  It worked really well even on low speed.  It had more air output than a 6 D-cell battery portable fan on high speed.  I had a small deep cycle battery that it ran off of (the battery was only rated for 23 amp hours).  I ran the fan on average 3-4 hours a day and I only had to recharge the battery every 2 weeks if I was really disciplined in turning off the fan when i wasn't using it.  If you are going to run it constantly over a weekend i would recommend a larger deep cycle battery in the 40 amp hour range.  It was no louder than a battery powered fan but there was so much more air output.  The kids in my cabin called the high setting "hurricane mode" because of the air output.  High speed was a bit loud (similar to a regular box fan), but if sound isn't an issue then it is the greatest 12v fan out there.
I highly recommend this product.  The price is good and so is the product.
7842	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I trailer in saltwater and freshwater and don't disconnect (the lights are handy at night), so these really don't work for me.  Both times the main bulb failed with a green spot over the lens.  Submersible is a curious term for something that fails when wet.
8237	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!.
3389	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this on a whim while I was stepping up my windshield wiper game and it definitely helps make water bead and run off my car windows. In light rain you don't even need wipers. It's worn off over time and I haven't bothered reapplying because, while its nice, it's not exactly a necessity, and I'm kind of a lazy man. Let's face it, glass and water are both pretty good at being frictionless on their own. I have it in my bucket of car detailing supplies, right next to my back-to-black trim treater and my headlight de-fogging paste, awaiting motivation to strike.

7080	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like that this extension harness does NOT have a separate ground wire that you are required to bolt to the auto frame like some other harnesses do.
8626	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Overall this is a pretty nice little unit.  It is compact, shipped in a compact box and the overall product quality is good. Product comes with an easily removable vacuum pump, solid plastic collection ball, collection tube of larger diameter tubing that connects to a smaller diameter tube that looks to be wire reinforced plastic covered tubing that easily should fit in most dipstick tubes. Tubes were long enough so I could sit the unit on the floor and have plenty of tube to insert down the dipstick tube.  Very easy to set up and use and the included red funnel makes it very easy and neat to pour the waste into a container for recycle.  The pump, funnel and the tube simply push onto the ball which has rubber type attachments.  I put a little oil on the o-ring under the top rubber piece to help improve the seal.  I bought this to change engine oil for a car that uses 7 liters of 5w-30 synthetic oil.  I ran the engine to heat up the oil some before I started the removal.  The system worked and got just about all of the oil out of the engine through the dipstick.  BUT, it took 4 hours to extract the oil.  The oil moves very slowly through the 1/8" diameter or so tube that is inserted into the dipstick.  With the viscosity of the oil, the small diameter of the tubing and the limited amount of vacuum you can create - you can expect anywhere from 1/2 hour to 1 hour per quart. I tried this with some lighter viscosity fluids and it works really good.  This will be good for the snowblower, generator and other small oil volume units I have.  If you have time this is a nice item.  If you want it done quick this will not be your best option.
2665	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for my trailer. It's ok for what I'm doing (as long as it doesn't leak) the lid is a nice solid plastic but the sides and bottom are a little flimsier than I'd like to see I re-enforced the bottom with metal bar stock you can find at most hardware stores

5087	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Years ago I was given a VERY large one of these to use at the beach, this works GREAT for a beach/lake/river towel, dry off BEFORE using your towel so you don't end the day with a super wet towel.  I keep a couple of these on the boat for myself and the kids.  My wife thinks I am retarded so she won't use it.  But hey, It sure beats having to throw towels in the washer/dryer after EVERY single boating trip.
Now, since it only does light oxidation, the headlight I got out of a junkyard did require some scrubbing (with a scotch pad, it did the trick) to get the heavier yellow staining off.

Update-After one winter the locking mechanism and shaft completely rusted over to the point I had to take a mallet and bang it out of my hitch.  Since this and the masterlock are are only good for a year or so you may as well get the masterlock for half the price.

A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.
Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.

2582	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	now this is the worst shortcut I have ever attempted.  Just buy the tank that fits in your truck bed along with a fill right pump, and auto shutoff nozzle at first.  Because after you buy this, you will be pissed off, and wind up spending the money you should have to begin with number one....kit comes with a s***ty hose that gas eats through in the first week.  This is after you have to find help getting said s***ty hose over the flange of both the pump and the nozzle.  Even if you manage to get this done yourself, you still pissed off because you just wasted an hour and your hands and fingers are blistered.  The pump itself is great.  Everything with it will definitely let you down.

BTW, the truck has bed rail protectors.  After installing these anchors, I used a sharp razor blade to carefully cut openings in the plastic covers that used to hide the stake holes.

So around 10 years ago I bought my first absorber from an auto supply store. I have used ever sense and I am still using it. I bought the second one because I got tired of buying chamois for drying my Suburban. The chamois is marginally better when it comes to absorbing water but the difference is so slight and the long-term cost difference is so great it is well worth the purchase.

2538	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I tore out a fence and the county came in and rebuilt the ditch. I had about a 40 foot wide strip a half mile long to reseed with Bermuda grass. Not allot of acres but more than I could do with a small hand-held spreader and much too rough and sloped for a pull-type. After researching as much as possible, I bit the bullet and bought this one. It mounts quite easily to my Kawasaki 4 wheeler rack (either rear or front) and has a shield to keep grass seed from hitting the driver if front-mounted. It mounts with 2 U-bolts with wing-nuts. Then attaches to it's own mount with 2 small hitch pins. The only tool I needed was an Allen Wrench (1/32 size, by the way!) The 12 volt actually plugs into the power plug. I didn't have to wire it to the battery as I had expected. (Though this could be a problem if you don't HAVE a power plug on your ATV!) My only complaint about this spreader is that it has no graduations or markings to help you set the openings for different seed or fertilizer. It has two large holes in the bottom of the spreader that are opened with a draw-bar. It took quite a bit of experimenting to get it set close to where I thought it should be. There are instructions on how to calculate the opening but since my 4wheeler has no speedometer, I couldn't use their calculations! If you are spreading Bermuda grass, as I was, then halfway open and driving at 1.8 MPH is about right. The seed flowed through the spreader just fine. Over-all I am very happy with my purchase. I know I will use this spreader to seed pond dams and waterways and spread weed & feed on my lawn in the future.

4161	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is magical, and is really what makes the color of your faded boat come back. You do need to completely deoxidize your boat before applying this stuff. I find it is best to spend a few days on the process. I use a dual action buffer with a heavy cutting pad (or 2) and #67 to get the oxidation out. Then after a day to let the gelcoat rest, apply this stuff with the DA and a medium polishing pad. Repeat two more times, allowing the gelcoat to rest a day in between! If you rush the process, the color will fade faster. Immediately apply a coat of Ultimate marine wax after your third, spaced out coat of polish. A second coat of wax the next day will pretty much make your docked and lifted boat stay gorgeous for a year. If you don't have a roof on the dock, you should rewax halfway through the summer.
6263	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I used this for a while. Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did. One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that won't give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it.

I keep this product in my car.  I have always just rolled it up after I use it and keep it in the provided tube.  Even when it goes several weeks between uses, the Absorber is still slightly damp and ready to use.  This is extremely important, as anyone that has ever tried to use a dried out chamois knows...  I had thought that keeping it in the tube would maybe make it smell or get mildew or something like that.  Not the case at all.

5380	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works very well at absorbing water. So much so, that I'm constantly ringing the water out of it while drying the car. Practical though, because you don't have to waste a bunch of regular towels - just squeeze it and reuse. Has the texture of a thin piece of leather. Doesn't scratch the paint, unless you get some dirt caught in it. And if you clean the car thoroughly first, that won't happen. It does need to be put away damp though. If you don't it'll dry out very stiff. It claims not to grow mold/mildew, even when stored wet, though I haven't tested that out long-term. Short-term (two weeks) it seemed fine.
0	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	After I wrote the below review, the manufacturer contacted me and explained how to use this.  Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.

The S516 is sturdy and well made. It makes a solid, leak free connection to the tire stem and fills all my RV tires as it should. The gauge is off by about 5 PSI too high but I use a standard gauge on everything I do so that is not a big deal. I think it's best to just use the built in gauge as a guide and then check with an accurate tool. Very happy with this purchase so far.

For the use on the boat, I highly recommend this product.  After washing boat, a quick wipe with the absorber keeps all the water sports off of the chrome and aluminum.  It also keeps water spots off any waxed areas.  Sometimes, we go fishing very early in the morning and the seats are wet with condensation - the Absorber is perfect for a quick solution.

9254	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I bought this as a gift for my wife who is always cold in the car, it does not get very hot, but it does get warm enough to take the chill off though, and for the price you can't go wrong.
451	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good shipping, packaging and on time. The decal seems of good quality. The South Florida sun will determine as to what quality it really is. As of now I like the detail and quality. I like that it is made in the USA. I would recommend it.


I would not go to Oz without mine!

2005	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this California Car Mini Duster to keep the interior of my automobiles dashboards, door panels, and consoles dust free.  I have several automobiles that I like to keep showroom new inside and out, and this California mini duster is an integral tool in my arsenal of car care products.  It works very well and removes the dust completely.  It doesn't just smear it around.  I keep my interiors clean to begin with, so after using the duster I just pat it on my hand several times outside the car and any dust flies off the duster and it's ready to go once again.
2495	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	So far I like this lock set up, I live in the Four Corners area of NM, I hope to not have the rusting problems some reviewers have had in the wet slushy climates.
6447	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I can dry my car with this rag and not ring it out once.  So it really does absorb.  I thought I'd never give up my chamois, but this does work better.  Can be thrown in the washer (but not dryer) for easy cleaning.  I only have one complaint.  If you store still damp in the provided container (which is the recommendation), it does have a slight musty smell when you take it out.  If this gets worse over time or with longer storage, I might change my mind about rebuying.
1017	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I cannot really complain, I have a few of these, one for car fluids the others I use for chicken feeders and waterer, works great with an inverted 5 gallon bucket with holes drilled in the lip for a chicken waterer, the same can be done with feed with larger holes in the bucket.
More importantly, the Meguiars Polish doesn't replenish the gel coat very well, IMO. Substitute with a $3 bottle of baby oil and wheel it in good. Results will be far superior and save money. I know it might sound strange, but baby oil is the polish to use. Seal it in with at least two coats of wax.
1180	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is just like the oil can my father used to use back in the day as they say.  You can reach a lot of hard to reach places with it.  It does put out a large stream of oil if you fully depress the lever, must use judiciously or be ready to clean up excess oil.
2493	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	seems like the kind of stainless steel that shouldn't rust. There is an o-ring in the lock part that fits over the oin, but it does not make a tight seal. Will keep it lubricated and hope for the best.

3498	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The best upgrade possible!
7794	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've never used a synthetic chamois before, so I'm not sure how well they are supposed to work.  I washed my minivan the other day; and I'd say it took one swipe on a panel, squeeze dry, then a second swipe to completely dry the panel.  The Absorber is a nice, large size.  It dries my car better than old bath towels, and it left no water spots.  I'm very happy with its performance and would buy it again.
3515	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I put it on my black painted metal mail box post & it did NOT bring back the shine at all. Endust does but I have to apply it weekly.
I just apply a little on a rag and I spread it on the headlight.  I then proceed to buff it with another rag.  I do not use force, just like buffing the wax on my car.  And then I remove any excess.  Very simple, and it really works.  My car looks better than when it drove it out of the dealer's lot.  I use Mequiar's other products to keep my car looking new.  No need to buy a new car because my car looks really good.
2199	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected.  Everyone I work with now comes to me when their engine light comes on.  It obviously does not fix anything but its nice to know what you got if you need to go to get service done  Easy to use and you can clear lights to see if there is really a problem that come back

7971	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have used this system for approximately 15 years.  We have several trailers, and of course they have different hitch sizes.  This system makes it so easy to change the ball.  I have this system on all three of our trucks.  My daughter pulls her horse trailer almost on a daily basis.  Then we hook up to the flat bed for getting hay.  She changes the ball and away she goes.  I have purchased several of the kits and gave them to friends for gifts.  Sure beats trying to find a wrench to change the ball. If you have this system you will always have the right size ball with you.  I use the plastic holder. It keeps the grease  from getting all over.  I have a small Phillips screwdriver to help push out the pin. I am going to purchase another set at the Tulare Ag Show this February.  Never had a problem with them.
I put quick connects (and pigtails) on the batteries and a mating connect on the chargers, then plug them in as needed. One charger stays connected 24/7 on a motorcycle battery I use to power a car stereo for in my shop. I turn off the charger when the radio is on due to some EMI.

9061	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I've had repeated trouble securing the marking wheel on the end of the shaft. Even after adding thread locking compound, the little screw kept working loose, causing accuracy problems.
I just used mine again (for the third time) this afternoon after getting home from the office and it just gets better every time I use it.
I'm extremely disappointed to read some of the bad reviews people have left for this product, who obviously, in most cases, seem to lack general understanding of its purpose and function.
800	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an exact Briggs & Stratton Fuel Filter 150 Micron 5018K. It was easy to install and at the right price. I like to price-shop, and Amazon.com had it at the lowest price, so it was a no-brainer to purchase it from Amazon.com.
Was debating between four and five stars because there are two things needed to perfect this beast:  1.  It's too heavy - it is a beast.  My old creeper was much lighter and easier to sling around and hang up out of the way.  2.  The wheel covers, or humps, are cumbersome, particularly when it's time to hang it somewhere.  My old creeper could just catch its wheels on the edge of a counter or board and it would stay.  Not this one.  I put a couple eye bolts on one side to catch two nails to hang on when not in use.
Key: Advantage Master Lock, a normal flat key fits much better in my pocket than the round barrel key of the Trimax and you can have extras made.
6265	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	We bought these for use with our pop-up camper and they work very well for that purpose. They are toothed on top and bottom to allow for good traction on most surfaces and the curve of the top fits our tires quite well. These are lightweight and have holes for use with a rope if you prefer to tie them together. While they are not as rugged as rubber chocks, they work very well for our purposes and I will likely replace them when they get old or worn.
5726	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The factory end was  destroyed by my wife. So I have to put in a new end on the tow wires and a bracket to hold it from dragging on the ground and being destroyed again I also purchased these covers and put a little dielectric grease on the ends to keep corrosion from happening.

Not sure how long it will last in the marine environment but it is cheap enough to replace. Overall, it is by far the best solution I could find for circulating cool air in the cabin of my boat in south Florida. It is also the best bang for the buck. There are cheaper fans available, but none that perform as this one does.
2259	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought a 20 year old project car with exterior Windows that were scratch to hell after being in the California desert for two decades. Contemplated buying new ones but very hard to find. So I tried this compound and magic!  Scratches are gone!  Man!  Very happy.
6943	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you're looking at this product and have a Toyota truck, by now you know how far away the trailer harness sockets are. This is the perfect length to route from the socket to the hitch. I zip tied wire loom to each end and used a third longer zip tie to attach it to the left safety chain loop. Plug tucks under the bumper cover. Looks factory...stoked!
8808	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Ok so this is made in the USA using US and foreign components, but it's still made in the USA!!!  I can see where the weak point would be in the head of this scrapper, but it's 10 bucks.  I bought two.  One for my vehicle and one for my wifes.  The telescoping feature works great and MAN is it long.  You just loosen the sleeve nut, slide it out to where you want it, then tighten the nut and go to scraping.  When you extend it ALL the way it can pivot a bit where it slides, but slide it back an inch or two, retighten and you're golden!
assembly of the wheels and caster is straight forward. if you do your own oil changes, you should be able to install the wheels and caster with no issues, but be sure they are tight though. when i began using my creeper for the first time, after i was done i noticed that one of the wheels were loose and it was due to the lack of torque i used to bolt down the wheels.
Remember, measure your tire pressure with cold tires, if you have just parked your car after a trip over 20 minutes, the tires will be filled with hot air, so the pressure will be more than normal (maybe 1-4 pounds, depends).
WHOA it actually works!

3615	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Everything about this purchase exceeded our expectations--thanks!
1679	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	As others here have said, Ca dusters are not what they used to be.  Wood handle or plastic, the main problem is how few threads there now are in the standard size.  I bought this big one to try to compensate for that and seem to be successful.  It is big and hard to sweep nicely across one's car.  I may shorten the handle.  I'd rather simply have the old, smaller one with the one side packed with dense strings.  Yes, this did arrive with to much oil/wax but that is good in the long run.  Mine is wrapped in news paper to absorb a bit of it.
The quality of the tool? 10 out of 10.
2300	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I was looking for a 5-terminal relay because I need the 87a terminal to switch something off versus switching it on. This is listed with a 5-wire harness and I foolishly thought it was a 5-terminal relay and it was not. I am sending it back.

9913	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Heard about this air filter from a friend that pulls a travel trailer often. I had to try it and see for myself. I often pull either a 24 ft gooseneck low boy trailer or a 28 ft enclosed cargo trailer. We use these on our youth hunts all over Texas. So far I notice I don't have that hesitant stall when when I pass.

5387	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good value for the price
At some point, the Club was mentioned. The professional thieves laughed and exchanged knowing glances. What we knew was that the? Club is a hardened steel device that attaches to the steering wheel and the brake pedal to prevent steering and/or braking. What we found out was that a pro thief would carry a short piece of a hacksaw blade to cut through the plastic steering wheel in a couple seconds. They were then able to release The Club and use it to apply a huge amount of torque to the steering wheel and break the lock on the steering column (which most cars were already equipped with). The pro thieves actually sought out cars with The Club on them because they didn't want to carry a long pry bar that was too hard to conceal.
8648	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have many things that are a PIA to change oil in because they need to be tipped over to drain the oil. Lawnmowers and generators and other things around the house. I had just finished a back breaking day changing the oil in all these things and had only the car to do, when this arrived. I decided to give it a try. I never had an oil change go so smoothly. I sucked the oil out in about 10 minutes and poured it into an empty container for recycle and poured the fresh oil in the car. Finished in about 15 minutes and did not lay on the ground or even get my hands oily. This will be an absolute necessary device for the transaxle in my lawn tractor that is without a drain plug. But very conventient for the jobs that don't need it but still come in very handy. No more picking up the lawn mower or edger or generator to pour out dirty oil and slopping oil all over the floor for me. The suction tube reminds me of a bicycle brake cable. It is small and stiff and has metal inside. It slides into the dip stick easily and you can feel it hit the bottom of the oil pan. It is not a flimsy rubber tube and am very happy with my purchase. Wish I had it sooner.
6450	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good product
5657	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Easy to install but certainly not as bright as I expected.
7342	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good wire, too short as it turned out.
6228	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Simple and good at what it does - stop you from rolling.  I have these for my RoadTrek.  I wanted something more heavy duty because it's heavy... and these do the trick.  Bulky but good.
2432	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This one does the job, is penty strong enough to tow a jet ski and comes in a compact mesh bag.
It is slow, as others have mentioned, but it's still faster than putting the car up on stands, draining the oil, putting the car back down, etc.  Just make sure the oil is warm and give the thing a few pumps from time to time to keep it flowing.  It's neat and easy to pure the oil back into containers to take to the recycling.

4191	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Like most CRC products, this performs exceptionally well in a marine environment.
3963	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Bought this for my spare tire on my utility trailer. Very inexpensive (cheap), flimsy and loose fitting. Seems like it can be broken off easily. Will probably end up getting a cable lock. This device doesn't really give me a sense of security. I suppose for only five bucks you get what you pay for.

It worked awesome on 2013 MB C-250 . I had to measure how much oil it sucked out . Almost 6 qt - all oil . You just have to pump it up a few times , or empty it at half the job . Next will be our Honda van .

69	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great manual. Always fill your library before you fill the garage with Triumphs.
9470	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was amazed how much torque Honda's engines use on their crank pulley bolts. I thought those days were gone when VW quit making the air cooled pancake motors (If I remember right - 290 ft. lbs. or so on the pulley, 350 ft. lbs. or so on the flywheel). There is no other way to get the bolt off by yourself with the motor in the car unless you use one of these. Other than a flywheel tool. That sorta makes it a 2 person deal there when you are handicapped. This is the least expensive alternative. This worked great for what it was made for. At the time I had use of only one hand (surgery), and I was able to do a timing belt one handed with this tool (and a foot for power). I leveraged one breaker bar against the ground and pushed the other with my foot. I did brake the square drive off of one 1/2 inch breaker bar, but this tool sustained no damage. Now I have everything I need to do Honda timing belts every 70k miles. One handed if needed! This does fit a 2001 Honda Accord 4.3L V-Tec.

7558	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works better than a leather Chamois and remains soft but be sure to put it back in the tube it came in and put the cap on.  Holds about double its volume in water and leaves not a streak.  We love this for drying our SUV and Corvette.  Highly recommend this product.  Bought 2, one for about $10 and one on sale for $7 at walmart.

7815	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing works great.  I have used it a couple of times and does much better than the lambskin chamois I have had in the past.  It absorbs much more than the Lambskin and my car was spot free.  The real test was the sunroof on my car where the water tends to pool and leave water spots.  In the past I always had water spots on it.  Not anymore.  Definitely a must have for those who wash their car.  As another reviewer noted, these are at local big box stores for around the same price if you include tax.  I may pick up another for inside the house.

4329	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I have found two of the three locks in this set useful. The hitch lock did not fit on my trailer. Thus this only gets four stars.
2081	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My car dash and panel is black.  It is constantly dusty.  I keep this in a baggie under my seat and quickly swipe all of the dash and instrument panel.  It keeps my car looking nice in little or no time at all.

Also, it is easy to apply.  Clean your windshield.  Apply a small amount of RainX similar to the way you would apply wax.  Let it dry a minute or so and (easily) buff off any residue.  I think the reapplication rate is about three months in normal driving.
None so far.
This will be a good drying towel for the car and camper, just didn't work as hoped for our purpose.
6454	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Liked this so much I bought a second one.
With that said, you only need a little bit.  I usually rinse the headlight, put few drops and polish at slow speeds side to side.  I only did it once and the headlight looks clear as a day. Granted, I can probably make it even more clear if I took the time and probably better to finish it off with plastic protector.
2972	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	looks like good quality
Overall, this looked like it came from China....very poor quality...would not suggest.
3626	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Terrible product to use on a visor for a motorcycle helmet.  Left a residue that couldn't be buffed out and instantly started hallowing. Visibility was worse than before using the product  Visibility is much better with soap and water! If I'm using it wrong -- let me know, but the directions seemed pretty simple.
9708	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product!
4266	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This charger does charge with no problem but does not maintain.  I am a huge Schumacher fan.  But this time you get what you pay for.  First off This charger is inconsistent.  I measured the final voltage before charging stops.  It ranged from 14.77bed to 16.40vdc that's not good.  My biggest complaint is that once charging stops It never starts again.  I discharged my battery down to 6vdc to check when the maintainer would start the charging cycle again and it never did.  Super not cool if you want to leave your battery pluged in for long term or winter storage.  However I am going to use this charger, my needs are pluging in my truck every night for battery charger and engine heater.  So for me this works perfectly.  I have a warm engine every morning and a battery bank topped off in my truck I use for camping with an inverter and a huge battery bank that is wired into my trucks electrical system.  I plug it in every night and it reaches it's top off voltage and shuts down and my engine block heater keeps going and that works for me.  So do not buy this for a camper or anything you plan to store and not use for more than a couple of weeks or as an alternative for a vehicle with an electrical ground you cannot find that slowly drains your battery because it will be dead when you go to start it 2 weeks later.  Buy a better charger.  I have a schumacher 12vdc atm standard battery charger that works for anything you need.  But much more expensive.  You can find alternative cheap battery maintainers.  Just do your research before you make a long term commitment battery charger.  Good luck.
8254	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Opened up package, got suction cup wet, placed on flat area of windshield. This thing has held on for 3 weeks straight so far. Hot days, cool mornings, crossing wakes at cruising speed. Very pleased!
4558	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have been a long time user of this product, and found it to be the best around for the price. I keeps your battery fully charged and if in a cold location warm (by charging the unit). The installation is straight forward and comes with a nice mounting bracket.
5829	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product definitely needed this when i wired my trailer
8860	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Like many people looking for this product, I had an older one that worked great. I just can't find it anymore, so I'm looking for a replacement.
2152	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice sized refrigerated cooler. I bought an AC adapter also so that I could cool down the contents the night before.  I put a glass of water in it.  Eight hours later the water was half frozen!  What a great cooler.  The size it perfect to allow us to place it on the floor behind the driver front seat.
This is one of those items you will want to keep close by, because an accident can happen at any time. Great to have something like this in your corner to help you keep your vehicle clean.
In summary, the counter is exactly what I was looking for and appears to be well made and reliable.
5486	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works fantastic !!
2520	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The installation was easy and straightforward.  If it fails any heavy load test in the future, I'll revise the rating.
587	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I almost always try to use OEM accessories with my tools.  There are exceptions as we all know but sticking with the products owned and designed by the original manufacturer usually renders the best results.  I especially like this wool polisher for its durability, quality and the final finish it always renders.  If used correctly you will never get burn marks or swirl marks.  Always take your time, use superior products and learn the proper techniques for using them!
7776	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It worked well but was a touch thinner than what I'd thought of as "paste". That said I'd buy it again.
9974	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good but I wish the sides would stand up better.
166	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you own an Audi or WV and you do work on your own car ( I DONT TRUST SHOPS or STEALERSHIPS) than you will need this and you will be thankful you got. It can be a bit confusing to read at first and everything is black and white no color except for the cover but it has ton of info every nook and cranny you need to know about your car.
7459	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Cool product makes your car drying fast!
9665	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	fit well
9059	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works Great.
I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight.
This would be great for motorcycle visors and anything plastic really.  For consistency, I recommend using a handheld polisher or drill attachment of some kind.
1496	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	***** Listen Up All You Amateurs *****
One tip, If you can get to your oil filter from the top, use some old plastic bags(like Ziplock or doubled up newspaper bags). Put them over the oil filter, before you finish unscrewing it.  Then catch it in the bag as it drops off the threads. If you can't pull it up, just zip it or knot the bag and drop it onto some newspaper. Retrieve and drain the filter.
7513	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works great, just peels crome to easy. Still like it
this plus the roof vent version really helps to cool motor home without turning on Ac.
4861	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Happy
So, this rivet tool only popped about 50 rivets, TOTAL.  I'm not having the same problem as everyone else.  The threads in the nose stripped so the mandrels won't stay in place so it never gets to grip the rivet at all.  My old rivet tool had installed at least 1000 rivets before I misplaced it.
If you have to get a 30 dollar or under gun, it is hard to beat this one.
286	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
4080	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Instructions poor, and the amounts to mix together are in fl.oz, which is hard to gauge given these are pastes in tubes. Also, it's more translucent that hoped for: the dark Fiberglas under still shows through, so while the spot is repaired it also still shows.
1490	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Have not used the cable yet. But they was on time, just as the e-mail noted projected.
6618	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The best for below the waterline seals
5479	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I've tried this on headlights of several coworkers' cars.  If you have some light hazing, like my headlights, it does a pretty good job.  If your headlights are peeling or the clouding is deep or yellowing you will probably not be impressed.

8835	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great club and fit fine on a 2003 F150 Supercap
104	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	as listed
Third, I place the Absorber on my drying table to soak up any extra water blown off the dog with my high velocity dryer. This saves me from having water blown everywhere.
943	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works like a champ cutting a saw burr out of a cut tube
9354	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Did the job, I do not believe you could get the crank bolt out without it.
9825	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Bought this as a gift, as I have one for myself. they seem to add a touch of response from the gas pedal in my opinion, not to mention they last forever with some regular cleaning.
397	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	XL fit perfectly at 5'10", 205lbs, 46" chest and 32" waist.  Thicker than I anticipated.  A bit harder to stuff into a small space, but I'm sure they will last longer as well.

8518	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	My one works as it should, but I can't give it 5 stars, as:
6906	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	When I first got fan it made a very irritating whine and I was not happy.  I do not run invertors due to the same sound.  Googled a camping website and a person said their fan whined and the person called Fantastic and was told to run the fan with reversed polsrity for a while.  I ran my fan reversed polarity for 10 min or so and when I hooked it up properly the whine was gone!,  I am very happy now!  I am guessing the bearings are sealed and motor pre lubed and running it backwards helps to spread the lubrication uniformally.  I have been listening to noisy 12v fans for a long time and my Endless Breeze fan is exactly what I dreamed of.  Now I have to see if it bothers my 12vLed tv when I go to my camper.
7784	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got this to use after washing my car - it works great. Recommend purchasing this - you will not be disappointed.
I bought one of the Chemical Guys Waffle Micro fiber cloths and it was awesome,
Wish I had bought one years ago and just put another one on my wish list
1451	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Outstanding  product easy to use and NO leakage as other reviewers indicated!!
2819	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Worked great for the first month or two but very quickly deteriorated, allowing water in (not good if you're looking for a quick cover on your convertible) Also leaves tons of powder like lint as it breaks down, enough to warrant a carwash Everytime it's removed. Definitely a case of you get what you pay for. See pics.
6472	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	worked great

It does not leave tge plastic glossy black like armor all would but thats not its job.  Its job is to clean and then follow up with meguiars m40, I believe, if tou would like the glossyness.
7250	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent affordable
6062	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Not as I imagined, but it helps for small areas only, can't let you feel big deference before and after using it.. this is my own experience, maybe because i'm not professional and it need someone with certain kind of experience to do it right. at the end seller suppose to provide you after purchasing with needed information about how to use this product properly well
Sprayed the product on, and nothing seemed to happen.  5 minutes later, the rust stain was GONE!
9365	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I used it on a D17A2 motor that was in a 2002 Honda Civic ex, it fit very well but falls out easy if you don't have it wedged it in just right against something else(control arm, ground, or axle) it will fall out or slip out. If this happens in the middle of trying to take the crank bolt out you will break your hands unless your superman but then you will have to repave your driveway. That is why I say this is a 2 person job one to pull the breaker bar and one to keep it in the crank. If the fit had less play it would get 5 stars but this is a great tool!

5125	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	this is good lithium grease. i put it on all my ground blocks and distribution blocks in my boat. it keeps the corrosion away and repells water..
2547	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Husband loves this spreader.  He had another brand and says this one is superior to this original.  Nice helpful product
8969	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The club is a must for anyone with a car or a truck. My truck was taken from the front of my house but thankfully the club was on it, They only got to the end of the block and had to leave it. This was my second Club and I wll always have one on any car that i own. A MUST!!!
3056	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	excellent
5123	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for drying your car or truck, I have 2 and just love them.
9025	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works Great!!!!!!!
4971	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It hold water and works well
8607	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was concerned that the small tube would be a detriment to flow and that it would suck too slow.  I suppose it might be slow with 90w gear oil, but with Tranny Fluid the job was done in about 1 minute.  Overall, this product works great.  There are no air leaks and it seems very well constructed.
I LOVE IT
110 volt power supply is great accessory.  We plugged the cooler into the motel room or friends house most nights. We did use the Coleman power supply we already had without problems
7389	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the VERY best material for cleaning rubber or acrylic stamps.  Stays moist a long time before needing to wet it...and leaves NO lint!
9441	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	fit good and work good. takes some fiddling to get it to snug. and crutch the breaker bar against something solid.  if diy, and good work tool and how to work on car. i recommend.
2307	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As Advertised AND Quick Shipping
5465	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This works great with a powered buffer (i use my die grinder with a towel wadded between the throttle to keep speed down) and felt pad. I don't think you would do very well manually
8993	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	works great, I still have my Jeep
2079	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Performs well.  I originally purchased this mini duster for my car but I have been using it around the apartment instead.  Works great!
9581	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great item
33	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Suction is "pretty" good but not great.  While it does pickup all the mess, it takes several passes to get the job done. Doesn't matter if you use with or without the hose. Haven't tried the tire pump yet, but was glad that it operates on a separate switch function.  (Doesn't use the same blower)

148	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Came well packed sealed brand new. perfect for working on anything i would ever need to and more. Would highly recommend. Came fast.
1358	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Okay so prior to buying this creeper I already knew what to expect because my Dad bought one a few years ago and overall I like it. It seems very durable and almost rolls too good. I find myself having to prop up against a tire to do anything that requires too much force or you simply roll away. I like the casters (or wheels are more like it) and it will roll over cords though I don't recommend doing that.

5120	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is a good solid winch

4786	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product. How did I ever live without it?


After owning for 6 months, i can say this fan is way over priced.  I have 2 of them.  the legs are falling off, it vibrates and falls off wherever you place it.  how these are getting 4.5 stars is beyond me.  I wish they would not put made in america on it, it give OUR products a bad image.

7940	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product is absolutely the best product of it's kind. I have used at least 12 or more cans in the last 25 years. Any "Fiberglass Evercoat" product is decidedly the very best that can be purchased. The only 'down side' is the fact it sets up in just minutes. Gotta' work fast! That can be a 'plus' if one's in a hurry though. This can be easily sanded without filling the sandpaper like 'bondo' does. I have used it in automotive and woodworking operations,
2015	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The best for dusting in home, or in car, the dirtier it gets, the better it works. The auto duster is great too!
7968	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	You've got'ta love these SS tow balls.
8401	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product, some reviews talked about them falling off so when i put them on i put a zip tie through the bottom so their is no way it will come off unless the zip tie fell off. Thanks great product.

Works!
6600	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great fan. Easy to store. Works great in my van application.
815	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits like it should and does the job.
Fits transmission dip stick opening.
9280	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works and fit perfectly on my three rail motorcycle trailer tires / wheels!
This is nothing like the rubbing compound I remember from years ago where the slightest mistake could be costly.  I even used this with a drill and pad with almost no real results.
7546	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Perfect match for use with Connor Towing 1625200- Adjustable 2" Ball Mount.  Keeping this coated with WD40 so it does not corrode.  Working great!

---  which had rusted out with 3-4 inch diameter holes where Ford created a lip on the bottom to attract mud/salt and subsequently rust.
8809	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I hadn't even used this ice scraper 10 times before the handle snapped off the head. The review by Wayne proves that this isn't just an occasional problem.
1396	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	TERRIFIC!

808	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	When replacing this filter style, it is important to replace the pre-cleaner filter as well, this was the exact part I need and shipping was fast.
6207	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	good
4974	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Rag can't go through car it stays.....
707	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I replaced the motor instead of the whole assembly.
2672	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product and delivered as promised.
2738	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This thing is a piece of crap.
Now I'm wrapping it tightly in newspapers and placing in it's storage bag for a week in an attempt to get the excess wax out.  I pulled it out of bag yesterday and the wax had soaked the newspaper through five layers.  Had to change out newspapers and try again.  I am hoping that after using 15 newspapers over three weeks it will stop leaving the gobs of wax on my car.
1267	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Replaced a cheaper one I had, sqivel head comes in handy.

6398	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this to glue a flexible solar panel on the roof of our travel trailer, I have used this for this purpose twice now, works very well.
1172	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked Great
6875	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice product. Really restored the shine to a used boat I purchased.  I did use a buffing machine for the first two steps that really worked great. I then hand waxed afterwards. Boat looks like new again.
2565	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great
8074	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I actually use this to mount a Go Pro camera inside a vehicle using a handlebar mount.  This cargo bar is well made and works well for my purpose.
