A telescopic handle for tall people like me (6'2"), a HEPA filter, small, portable size for storage, and good functionality for dealing with pet hair and cat litter. It is noisy and scares my cat, but I think the noise level is normal for a vacuum. It's made a big difference in keeping my home clean and I prefer it 100% over my old days for using swiffer everday.
4696	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Extremely Disappointed! I bought one these several years back and it worked fine for about 5-6 years and then just died but it worked well up until that time. I decided to buy another one because the old one had good enough suction for small jobs and that was all I needed it for. It had a decent battery life and with the extra battery it would work for at least 20 minutes. The new one, though, does not seem to have the same amount of suction and definitely doesn't have hardly any battery life! I took it off the charger and the first battery didn't work at all and the second battery lasted only a couple of minutes. I still have the old charger and the battery that was on that one did a much better job, but there still wasn't the same amount of suction. I would try to return it but it is impossible to take the handle apart once you put it together and then try to get it back in the box. I would definitely not recommend anyone buy this!

OXO makes easy-to-use real handy products, and I have never been disappointed in any of them.  At this price, you can afford to try the clips out.  You'll probably want to buy more.

4412	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Have been using it for years, just bought a second one as a gift for someone else. Lightweight, easy to carry, long handle, excellent suction. I use it on the wood floor, rugs and carpet - gets the job done every time.

I kept the floor attachment from my old one, because i like it better. To me it was a more simplistic design, that worked well.

The beats are hot, the lyrics are cool and the production is terrific.  I'm not the biggest rap fan in the world, but there is no denying that Em and Dre are an incredible team, and that Mathers tells compelling tales to a great beat.  Short skits are scattered between songs, making this a true concept album.

5725	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	this is my third purchase of Eureka vacuum. I always happy with the suction quality. This is a great vacuum and the price is so reasonable, I wish it is less noisy.  Another negative: I don't think the blower works. Mine only could not blow anything, it only blows weak air that does not manage to move dry leaf. I don't know if this is the case in every machine or only mine.
3779	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Bought this on November 13 last year. Have used it 10 (that's ten) times. I only hand wash it; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it. I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes. No scratchers have been used on it. It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge. Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it, but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I don't wish to eat rust.
I would like a more sturdy storage sleeve after this one wears out.
5306	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	When getting a unit. The back up battery is ideal and actually necessary. I wish the vacuum was a little more powerful.

She also gave me old pressure cooker recipe books and I found that the cooking time is a little different with the new pressure cooker (both are Presto 6-quart cookers). A black bean dish that cooked for 35 minutes in the old cooker only takes 25 minutes and a little more liquid in the new one. I learned by trial and error to find the right adjustments to make.

The fabric is better than it was previously --or maybe I just forgot what they were like when new. They are easily washed and are lightweight but still warm. I love this brand and I love these blankets. I  had written about the brand once upon a time and they  gave me a couple of blankets for free. (that was about 10 years ago). Since then I purchased about 3-4 more blankets and throws (not including this one) and we still have all of them. That's how durable they are! A little pricey? Yes they are not inexpensive but I have had blanket that cost less and shed and/or fell apart. This is worth the money!
6202	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have a little white Maltese and a dark brown sectional sofa that attacts every particle in circulation.  Even though Malteses don't actually shed, they do lose their hair like humans.  So between his hair and a couch that quickly embeds whatever touches it, I have tried three vacuums that did not even begin to address the problem. However, the Mighty Might pet attachment is fantastic!  The rotating brush really does a great job and the suction is very strong.  While I agree with others that the vacuum itself seems a little cheap (practically everything is plastic), it has very good suction.  It does a good job on area rugs and hardwood floors and is very light weight and portable for use on my carpeted stairs.  I'm very happy with this product.
6212	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	There seems to be some confusion about the name, I've seen this advertised as both "Mighty Mite" and "The Boss" and the manufacture listed as either Electrolux and Eureka (interchangeable companies). The model number I am reviewing is the 3670G. Regardless of the name, I really like this vacuum cleaner.
While its reasonably constructed and moves air as you would expect, the speed range is seriously flawed.

Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it, I recommend you get the "cable" style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible, but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable.
6475	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Did the trick for the busted belt on our Hoover Windtunnel!  Very easy to remove old, chewed up belt and replace with new.  No more burning rubber smell and new belt works as if nothing ever happened.
4467	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This cooker is huge, but it kind of has to be.  You're not supposed to fill the cookers beyond the fill line, so you need space at the top for air/steam, and to keep the release vent from getting clogged.  I'd forgotten that.  The cooker without the lid is great for making pasta, too--an added plus.  It's a Presto, so getting new parts will be easy.  It does what it's supposed to do, without a lot of extras, and I like that.

this vac has the best reviews for this type of product.
9982	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I don't think I have ever met an OXO product that didn't encompass great design AND supreme functionality.  My last kitchen tongs were much shorter (making it risky to approach the toaster), and they didn't fold up when not in use. Since all my kitchen utensils in my tiny kitchen are mainly stored in a lazy susan, my old tongs literally stuck out. They had no choice.

But- if you buy this thinking it can be used on carpets, think again. There is no beater bar. I knew this going in- and got is specifically for my hard wood and tile floors. It works fine on smooth area rugs- and the pet attachment works beautifully on dog beds. But that lack of beater bar means that I won't be getting rid of my household vacuum. I still give this five stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do.
4527	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The batteries die after only a year, & on my daughter's Quick up, her charger itself stopped working after a year.  We bought a corded Eureka & love it. It has 100 times the pick up.

Otherwise, the metal parts separate on use, and the plastic connectors break almost at once.  Worse, we had to wrap the handle, where it joins the wand, with duct-tape to keep it together.  We had to replace this piece of a natural body function because I had bought a box of filers.  So, now we are stuck.  Look into someone else's product.

6215	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up, we were looking for an appropriate replacement.  Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors, there were a few critical criteria.  It had to be strong, yet compact in size.  It should not be too loud, and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.  Finally, we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.  The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.  It produces a powerful vacuum, easily maneuverable, convenient for storing, the noise is not too bad, and a good price.  This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value, and, certainly, gets the job done that we bought it for.

And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power. And when I emptied the dust cup (which was incredibly easy to do, by the way, and your hand goes on the inside of the cup, while the dirt is stuck to the outside, so your hands don't have to ever touch the dust) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up!

1822	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The 25 year old home that we recently moved into has ClosetMaid shelving in all the closets. I don't know for sure when they were installed, but I assume when the home was built. The shelving and support brackets are made of steel but the old brackets have plastic connectors between the front of the bracket and the shelf. These plastic connectors have gotten brittle over time and are breaking and we have been experiencing occasional shelving crashes when the plastic connector eventually breaks.  Fortunately, these brackets have been redesigned so that they don't require the plastic connectors. So, when an old connector breaks, you have to throw away the old connector and the old metal bracket and replace it with this new bracket. I have decided to purchase these brackets in bulk for a good price on Amazon, instead of paying twice as much when you buy a package of two at a big box store. I guarantee that you will eventually have to replace most of your old brackets. In order to prevent future catastrophic crashes, I plan to start replacing every other bracket which should make the installation stronger and safer.  I will do this first in the closets which have heaviest clothing - i.e. suits, coats, jackets and also where heavy items are stored on the shelf.

4893	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Wall-mount fans are so practical, yet difficult to find. Never have figured out why. This fan was the perfect solution to keeping cool in a small office with absolutely no space to place a fan otherwise. It is easy to mount. However, read the instructions because, while easy, mounting is not necessarily intuitive.  The fan has 3 speeds. In a small space (my office is approx. 9' x 10'), the lowest setting circulates the air plenty. It runs quiet and has an extra-long cord to minimize the chance you will have to use an extension cord.  It includes a convenient cord, one tug on which turns the fan off.  The fan head adjusts up and down by hand-clicking into one of several pre-set positions (nothing to loosen).  The oscillation knob is in the traditional position on top of the fan, so keep that in mind when mounting. If you mount it too high, it will be hard to reach. Not an issue for me, because I always let it oscillate.  This is the second fan of this model I have bought and have not been disappointed yet.
1108	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The blades don't chop as well as expected.
I turn off the fans and close all the windows as soon as the temps start to rise in the morning, and since my house is fairly well insulated the house stays comfortably cool most of, if not all day, and then I open windows and turn the fans back on late evening when it becomes cooler outside than inside.  Using this fan, and even more so with the second one added, I only need air conditioning during the late afternoon of the hottest days.  I've cut my summer electricity bill back tremendously; the first fan more than paid for itself with the first electric bill.

Second, as you blow out the air on the hose, at the end there is a plastic piece that rotates and exposes a little opening in the hose near the base of the nozzle.  here I found some clogged hair and lint.  I used some needle nose pliers to pull out the clogged debris.  Then I detached the hose and carefully used a straightened wire hanger to see if I could push anything up to the nozzle.  The clog was very small but had a huge impact on the suction.  It took only a few minutes to clear the hose and the suction has fully returned.

I like that I can easily switch heads for stairs, floors/carpet, blinds etc, but that blessing is also a curse since that also means things don't stay attached.

I guess I'll try buying a couple of the additional  wall anchors to keep the wire from sagging so badly.  And trying to cut the wire? HA!  Good luck on that one!  I tried wire cutters of all sizes, and finally a brand new pair of metal shears, which simply shredded the end of the wire.  I had to tape the wires together on the cut end to get it to a size where it would go into the metal fitting.  I can see where this could be a good system, HOWEVER, you need two strong people to install it and get the tension correct.  And yes, I followed the instructions!

I do have to say, the metal "tray" part that goes inside does not get clean. I assume that is just because it is stainless steel..... I have scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and there is still a residue on it that I can see but not feel. Oh well. I'm still very happy with this cooker.

While I didn't mind "scuzzing" it my father insisted I should bring a set of these wipes as he uses them when he is in the wilderness on primitive hunting trips.  SAVED MY LIFE!  Due to severe exhaustion (24 hours of flight coupled with no sleep due to severe windstorm) I developed travler's stomach sickness in the middle of nowhere with no access to sanitary facilities, (if you don't count rocks.)  Without going into the gory details, I was a mess.  I whipped these out of my daypack and cleaned up beautifully.  While I was greatly embarrased, I did not smell of the "fits."  These towletts were the only form of "sanitiation" I had.  I did not get further illness, which was a great concern to me.  I used these wipes every evening to clean the ever-present dirt of me.  They were always dark brown with the dirt they removed.  At the end of the trip, I was at least pretty sanitary considering the conditions.  (Emphasis on no washing water or sanitary facilities.)  I could not thank my dad enough for suggesting these.  While most of us won't be going on these kinds of trips, I will always keep a couple of packs on me from now on just in case.

And finally, you cannot get anything out of this hose. Things get stuck, that's it. The crook at the end of the hose is hard plastic, the hose is super cheap soft plastic, so the hard crook makes it impssible to use anything like a broom handle to dislodge stuff, and the cheap plastic makes it easy to tear if you try using a wire. I've tried many times, and its more hassle than it's worth.

4331	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The so-called "cooking times" seem short and very fast, but they don't take into account the time it takes to build up the pressure, which is often longer than the actual stated cooking times.  For example, to cook potatoes the time is given as 8 minutes, but it takes 10 minutes to build up the full pressure before you're to start timing, so it's really 18 minutes.  Plan accordingly.  It's even worse for recipes done in parts where you cool it down to add a second step or things that would over cook if added at the beginning - then you have to build to pressure twice.

Well this little beast is dependable and indestructible like those phones use to be, but tiny and easy to store. Another bonus is that it uses a bag. Yes people, I LOVE THE BAGGED VACUUMS!! Why? Because every time I empty a canister vac all the dust and dirt and who knows what comes out and fluffs into my face. PLUS I have to reach in there with my FINGERS to pull out the pieces of yuck I just vacuumed ... who wants that? Not me. Back to this lovely little beast. I needed something that would work on the bare floors of my kitchen, bathrooms, and entry way AND have attachments to vacuum my couch. The Dyson I have is wonderful on carpet but the attachments are a pain to use, it never does a good job on my bare floors, and I've already told you how I feel about the canister situation. This little vacuum is awesome. It's light, it's strong, the attachments all fit perfectly and mount onto the unit so I don't need to store them elsewhere. The cord is plenty long and bags that this unit uses are cheap and large so I'm not having to change them out frequently. Best of all, it's tiny so it's easy to tuck away. Love it.

But this cooker's whistle doesnt work properly even when its a new one. There is leakage through it. The food is not cooked consistently. There is absolutely no enjoyment in cooking with this appliance.

2317	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy, adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it. However, the sliding panels are flimsy and don't move smoothly; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out.  The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction. Well-packaged in the box.
5118	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Amazon ordering and checkout great as always. Description of product very good. Packaged appropriately.  Arrived as stated.  Since haven't used this bag yet, also bought regular Hoover Y bags (paper anti-allergen only).  Got these because of their HEPA rating to intersperse with the other type and see which I liked best.  As the HEPA anti-allergen cloth bags are slightly more expensive.  But since my cat and I both have dust allergies thought I'd see if I noticed any difference between the two.  I did notice a difference with first HEPA filter equipped vac I bought which the spring that controls vaccing levels gave out after three months.  So ordered Hoover Tempo which has great rating in consumer magazine popular for its testing and reviews of products, but my final decision is based on customer reviews on amazon and a few other cust. review sites which a whole lot of folks gave this one a great rating. I digress.  The bags appear very well made and sturdy, are the right type Y for my machine and also got some pretty good ratings.  So as soon as I use one next bag change.  I'll try to remember to update this review.  And from my research I anticipate a higher and not a lower rating.  Thanks

When he came back from the trip, one of the first things he did was make another batch of mashed potatoes. I got called in this time to try it out and it was definitely doable even with my super swollen right wrist. He absolutely loves it and is now searching for other mashed potato recipes as well as other ways to use mashed potatoes (like for shepherd's pie) because he's so happy with the results. He's told me to look for other products by this manufacturer, which I will certainly do for presents for him in the future. I did receive this at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, but at the current sale price this is an absolute steal. At the regular price, it'd still be worth it given the ease of use and excellent results. This would be an excellent wedding or housewarming gift, and it's made my go-to list for those events. I may also get one for his sister who currently uses an in-the-pot beater and extremely overmixes them!.
I would recommend you buy the white on if you don't have a dishwasher, as the smallest lettuce pieces blend into the basket color. I have a dish brush that handles that pretty well, but I do wish I had ordered the other color.

1. There is a major design flaw in the floor attachment...The carpet function does not glide on carpet because it does not have a roller. Imagine you try to run the two pieces of a velcro against each other, that's how it is like when using this vacuum on carpet or rugs.

6312	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a perfect tie rack to place on the back of a closet door. I used the included screws to mount it to directly to the door, rather than just relying on the hanger portion. I can get 32 ties on it, which suffices for my collection. It should last a good while.
6117	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I've got extensive experience with two previous versions of this machine: the original and the first Boss model.  They both performed well under heavy use and I might not have needed the second if the mother of one of my co-workers had taught him how to change a bag.  Over time the Mighty Mite has gotten bigger and more powerful, but not if I recall correctly, heavier.  They've fixed the problems the hose caused by not being able to rotate, and spaced the wheels further apart so it doesn't tip over as easily.  The handle still gets warm but not overly so, and considering that it is a lot more powerful now, that's not so bad.  It was originally designed primarily to be used in conjunction with a sweeper, I'm sure - the lightness of the hose and wand thus a virtue - and not for use on carpets or to take the place of a whole house canister.  But it appears they've tried to appeal to the market for those just wanting a cheap vac as well as a handy one.
7035	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Will make cleaning drapes much easier. My Vacuum did not come with additional wands.
1166	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this in March, but didn't have a use for it till now, well now it's as if there is NO MOTOR!!!! It doesn't work! I tried and re-tried and NOTHING! Not sure if there is anything I can do cause it was purchased with a gift card??????
The attachments are great in that they serve dual purposes. For example, the same attachment is used for floors and carpets just by changing the position of the brush. Then the upholstery tool just flips around to be a brush tool. Some here have said it is too loud, yet it has about the same amount of noise as any good vacuum. Others said, it has an odor, well if it does, it goes away after using it for a time or two. I did a lot of research and am glad I decided to buy this Mighty Mite.

4531	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Great value. Picks up a lot. Easy to operate and good run time. The extra battery doubles the operating time and the batteries charge in less than an hour.
And with the hole in the handle end it can be hung.
I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does, please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me.

Speed 1. It's way too loud for me.  I set the fan about 8 ft away from my TV, near a sliding patio door. The TV volume had to be turned up quite a bit.
2217	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I love my 4 qt. pressure cooker, so I bought a larger one so I can seer larger pieces of meat, or quickly brown stew meat.  I also thought I could heat the pan more quickly if could use my larger burner.  The design of this pan is not good for either of those things.  The pan is 10" wide at the bottom, which would have been great for a larger burner, but the bottom of the pan has two levels. There's a "bump" in the center of the bottom, so the part that touches the stove is only about 7 1/4".  The "bump" is on the inside too, so it doesn't have a flat bottom on the inside either.  I'm returning it.

I don't have the heart to go in to more detail.  I'm not sure how I'll get my floors clean with this device.  This blew the budget I had to replace a 15 year old, $40, Dirt Devil little red canister (that finally burned out).  Harrumph.
Even so, why not save several bucks and get the Belkin?  Two compelling reasons in favor of the Monster (the included HDMI cable isn't one of them): 1. The color coding is a thoughtful timesaver/frustration eliminator (how many times have you found yourself on the floor suddenly at a loss about which device connects to which receptacle?) 2. The well-illuminated surface tells you at a glance whether the unit is connected and receiving power (Belkin units have too few or zero lights, requiring the user to get down on all 4's to determine whether the problem is a loss of power to the strip).
1937	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	fits and that's what I need
4928	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Ok, the bag fills up fast, but then that's because the system does such a terrific job. One bag lasted two weeks, but then the cleaner itself  gives an indication when the area is still dirty, so you tend to be more careful in vacuuming. Bag replacement is a bit clumsy but no more so than most machines.  I had no trouble removing the bag and not spilling its contents. Yes, you have to fold the top and bottom over when you install it but that's because it unfolds when it fills up.  Expense? Most vacuum cleaner bags are too expensive.
703	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	As described.  My other ones simply disappeared, so was glad to be able to order this "set".
6142	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I got this two years ago to use primarily to supplement my upright vacuum, and specifically to clean up the room with the cat boxes.

I occasionally used it with attachments for upholstery or  blinds.

choice
2808	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have been cooking with pressure cookers for 30+ years now. I had an old Mirro cooker (8qt) that I used for over 20 years. I had to buy a few gaskets over the years but it kept on working. The only reason that I had to purchase a new one is that I had cooked a chicken in it late in the evening and put the cooker out in the garage (it was winter) overnight. Believe it or not, a mouse got into the garage and chewed out the pressure check valve. I could not get a replacement because the cooker was so old!!! I bought the new one and I read the directions. Imagine my disappointment when I read that the cooker would not get hot enough on a ceramic top stove. I have had a ceramic top stove ever since they were invented and have used other pressure cookers on them with no problems whatsoever. Guess what? There was no problem with this one getting hot enough on the ceramic top either! It gets hot, gets to pressure and works just fine! Not sure yet if it will last 20+ years like the old one did, but I hope so!
I thought the Cuisinart brand name was supposed to be equated with excellence? I wouldn't accept another Cuisinart product if someone gave it to me.

On fan surface air velocity half-way up a blade at one point is, of course, just a sample point, and air velocity at a distance can be greatly affected by the degree of focus/dispersal.  Nevertheless, I hope this air velocity info helps us get a better sense for the differences between the fans.

2505	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for a fan that would really draw fresh air into my apartment (5 rooms, total ~1000sq ft).  It's very frustrating to me when it's nice and cool outside on a summer evening, but still sticky and stuffy inside from the heat of the day.  I've tried two of the little twin window fans, a larger oscillating fan on a stand, and small round fans in windows, but even all these of those in combination never really seemed to make a big difference in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been in houses with attic-mounted whole-house fans, and it's amazing how quickly they'll exchange the air in a whole house!  That's the effect I was hoping for.

4834	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product back in 2009, and it still works perfect. I used by hanging it up on the bathroom wall, the draw string makes it easier to turn on and turn off on the three cycles of high medium and low. It is easy to clean since the plastic comes apart, and easy to put back together. I use it in the bathroom because I live in an apartment building, the ventilation isn't the greatest here but the fan make this work, especially when I take a shower keeps the air well circulated. I had a different fan before, but it didn't last that long, plus the old fan did not have a drawstring to control it like this one does. I love the draw string also because it hangs really close to the bathroom light switch. Everything about this fan is great, well made, durable, easy to clean, drawstring for hanging fan on wall and very good price. Impessive. I was surprised with the bad reviews, with my experience with this fan, I was expecting the average 5 star reviews to be at 95%. Me, I am 100% satisfied.

487	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely LOVE these!! They are the perfect size for so many things. They are totally leak proof. I have no fear dropping it in my purse with something liquid in it. I used 3 different ones and didn't understand the comments about the lids being so hard to get on and off. But then the 4th one I did have an issue. But it's easily resolved. I ran it under hot water like someone mentioned to make it more pliable. And then put the lid on with a bit of difficulty. Then left it for 10 min. Came back and removed the lid with ease and put it back on very easily. So I would say when you get them and wash them, be sure to use hot water from the tap and then put lids on then. Leave them and come back and open them and they should be set. But like I said, I only experienced that with one so far. Don't let that keep you from ordering. These are FANTASTIC!!!!

OPERATION: One of things I noticed about this vacuum is the suction.  I have read other reviews about the lack of suction.  I really do not know how anyone can say this.  This unit like other types of canister vacuums this one has an adjustment ring to let you set the amount of suction.  I have it set at 3/4 closed.  Fully closed the suction is so strong that it sticks to the tile floor.  I also like this unit because of the swivel head.  This is the first small vacuum that can go around and behind the toilets.  The swivel head allows us to vacuum under most of the furniture without having to move the furniture.  This is a really big plus especially for big heavy furniture.  The other nice thing that I like is that the vacuum head removes easily even with the vacuum working.  This allows the vacuum access to tight areas with or without the crevice tool.

If my family were smaller, I'd definitely go with a smaller version because full, this thing is heavy duty. Oh and make sure you watch those lines on the side, which I didn't the first time, but it still worked out just fine. When you get this one (and all of them I'd guess) you have to put the handle on the lid and pan, it's really easy - just need a phillips screwdriver. I have heard you should check the screws now and then to re-tighten them. It's so easy to use and the book comes with some recipes to get you started. I did the beef stew recipe and it was the best stew I've ever made (I did tweak it and add some of my own stuff, too).

Some folks might be wondering what's going on with Marshall/Slim at the moment. His absence on the music scene, despite how you might feel about him, is noticeable. His music is singular, even in such a prolific field as Rap is and even with as many people that are on his CD, whether as a performer, a producer or a mixer. Historically, the people that have walked in his shoes never faired very well, whether it was through continued success or respect amongst fans or becoming a sell-out. I don't think Slim has to worry about the last one at all as he's struggled continuously to stay relevant and fresh.

* The narrow width make them VERY prone to falling over (even with the plastic "feet" attached).. I don't think I have had a one that hasn't fallen over several times.. luckily they are rarely damaged by this. You should just plan on putting it where you can "lean" one edge of it's intake side against something
One caveat.  Instructions for mounting the wall rack calls for a 1/4" drill bit.  The hole was too big for the supplied anchors.  Also, it would be nice if template were provided for drilling the holes so that measurement wouldn't be needed.  I have had this for something over a week, so I can't comment on durability.
4997	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	great
I don't give it 5 stars because I believe it could be sharper: as it is, it requires a bit of pressure when slicing and going twice over some ingredients, like salami. I imagine in time it will lose some of its initial sharpness. Otherwise the product looks solid enough to stand some few good years of use.
Do keep your eye on the time. It is easy to overcook your food and thus have it burn. But that is no fault of this pressure cooker. Set a timer and keep your eye on it.

Great for the cat litter box, little tiny hard objects, dust, dirt,hair etc.  I am going to order one soon for the travel trailer.  I hope they don't stop making this.

You can buy a separate HEPA attachment for this model that turns it into the pet model one tier up. It's liable to restrict airflow though, so unless you're unusually sensitive, I wouldn't bother.

There are two ways to cook with it after the little toggle starts rocking you are instructed to (1) put the pot under water and it cools down all at once, or (2) let it cool down on its own.  If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own, it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down. I thought cooking with this would be a lot quicker; but that aside, it is a great way to have something that really does cook in a fraction of the time it normally takes to cook something; but it is not a "microwave" quick type of instrument.

Being a chef for six years has taught me many things. One of which, you should always boil new plastic containers for at least a minute (best at 5 minutes) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing. We get enough plastics and other chemicals in our diets already. And if you are buying for your kid's lunches like I did, you should do this purely for your family's sake.
The Eureka uses only 6V (i.e. more efficient motor and system) and can swap batteries. An extra battery is included in this EUK96DZ model (from my local Sears), all for $36, a better value than the DD (about $50).
I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher, but really, scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.

Highly recommended. Great value for the money!
3345	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The handle for the pot is secured with only one screw. The handle itself is curved to fit against the pot, but the directions emphasize multiple times that you shouldn't overtighten to avoid cracking the plastic.  I tightened it reasonably and when the pot is full and it's tilted to pour out the contents (boiling water for example), the handle wobbles/turns slightly.  I can easily see this becoming a hazard with continued use/failure to retighten regularly.  Fortunately, Amazon was willing to accept the return.  The company could resolve this problem by using metal on the edge of the handle piece, selling their pots pre-assembled in a more sturdy manner, or hey- bright idea- USING TWO FASTENERS LIKE EVERY OTHER POT MANUFACTURER.  Hmm.

It works fine.  It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.  Similarly, I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.  I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived, and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.
7180	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Nice product which is color coded to help assist in controlling the maze of electrical cords to our home theater/stereo system.
A few other notes, it's a lot thinner and lighter in weight than I expected for stainless steel. I guess I was expecting something more like my presto canner but it's 17 quarts, it ought to weigh more. You have to attach the handles yourself but the directions are clear, the parts are all there, screws actually taped to their respective handles, so no one should have any trouble. It's easy to clean, it is stainless steel after all. My only complaint, if you could call it that, is being so tall versus wide, to brown the meat or onions, etc, you have to stick your arm down into the pot and if you're not careful you could burn your arm on the edge of the pan. So I recommend long spoons and tongs. I haven't done that yet, but you never know.

2744	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Yes, the TO1 carbon filter removes most of the chlorine taste, and installation is pretty easy. As one reviewer has indicated, it's hard to keep the filter housing from leaking. It's really due to the poor finish inside the opening into which the filter cannister is screwed. There are some rough seams that prevent the o-ring from seating perfectly. Minor adjustments are needed to obtain a leak-free fitting. BUT - and this is what they don't tell you - the unit has a life of FIVE years. Omni says that after five years, the plastic parts (that's every part, folks) will have degraded to the point of imminent failure. The instruction manual requires that you replace the clear plastic lower unit (cannister) every five years, or "costly repairs or water damage" may result. I contacted Omni, since I could find no source for the lower unit, and they told me that the ENTIRE UNIT MUST BE REPLACED EVERY FIVE YEARS, as all the plastic will have degraded to the point of failure by then. Doesn't say much for the quality of their product, does it?

Furthermore, even as he criticizes his mother, he says "I'm sorry, mama, I never meant to hurt you" -- this to a woman who was too busy fighting her own demons to be a mother to her talented and intelligent son. (Couldn't she PLEASE just tell him that she screwed up and she's sorry?) Another emotion that comes through, over and over, is his love for his daughter. What's not admirable about that? Also, I don't see half-naked women writhing in Eminem videos. I see intelligence and humor, and this is what I really love about Marshall Mathers. He is very very funny, and more power to him for taking his pain and his anger and creating humor and art. It's easy to perpetuate wickedness, tough to end the cycle of bad parenting and violence, but he seems to be trying.
This product was sent to me for testing and review, and the review is just my opinion, but the testing was delicious.
5713	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	great product - last one lasted 3 years of continuous use for small jobs - the replacement bags are inexpensive and the vacuum works very well

6334	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I bought a different one from another manufacturer which is a one piece rack. This one is not a one piece as the hooks which go over the door need to be attached to the main part which hold the ties.

3610	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My mother has loved cooking with a pressure cooker her entire life and she was devastated when her unit bit the dust. I was fortunate to find a new unit and at a very competitive price. She is very pleased with this new unit.
3091	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this pressure pan! I purchased it to replace my old aluminum 6qt cooker.  I love the stainless steel! It is easy to clean and lighter weight than my old one. The other thing I love is how easy the seal ring is to take out and put back for cleaning. That is awesome! Replacing the seal used to be so frustrating! No real cons other than the fact that the first time I went to push out the little rubber button on the lid for washing I cut my finger on the hole. My husband was able to remove the sharp burr that cut me and I haven't had a problem since.

5647	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Works very well and I like having the extra battery that sits in the charger so it's ready when you need it. My only complaint is the charger. You have to hang it on a wall to use it. Not convenient at all, and that's why it got 4 stars instead of 5.


The angled arm end makes it easy to get under the front car seats while keeping the small head attachment against the carpet for full suction.  As well, the small head attachment is double-headed.  It features a three inch flat head on one side and a bristled upholstery brush on the other - convenient for flipping between car carpets and upholstery.  The only tool that is lacking somewhat is the narrow wand used for getting into tight places.  The wand is designed with a notch cut up into it, so you cannot achieve full suction.  The bag is large enough that you could vacuum dozens of full sized cars before having to change it.  The unit functions perfectly for such use, but it is a bit noisy and gets very hot from even a couple of minutes use.  Nevertheless, the light weight, light duty attributes of this vac means that its design functions well for light work such as vacuuming cars.
2908	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The lid and bottom of the pot did not align; didn't appear to be a secure closure point.
I can now use it with confidence regarding both the loss of water and internal temperature.
4697	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Some of the hardware for putting the product together was missing.  I called the number provided by the company and they immediately sent the hardware to me.

When closing the same process. As an owner of several pressure cookers for many, many years, I've never experienced this before.  The product will be returned.  This is very unusual for a presto, I own many of them.  Never had this happened before.

6313	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Nice products, but my iron (Black & Decker-average iron with steam button) is a little large for it. Luckily, since the frame is just metal wire, I was able to bend it slightly to accommodate my iron.
Now, I cook professionally.  One of my valuable cooking vessel is the pressure cooker.  It takes really tough meat and make is buttery soft.  I haven't tried cooking veggies on these things, just because they are more delicate than a piece of shank.  By the way, I just ordered two for gifts.  And it made from stainless steal.
5865	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Had a long enough hose to dust with that was the reason for buying this . Work real well it did.
The only negative comments I can leave you with is the steep price, ...and that the fill hole isn't very useful.
926	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We got this for hanging up our kids artwork.  Very easy to install. It's best if you anchor into the studs.
4465	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We bought a second one of these because it's small, light, portable, and very good with handling pet hair. The bags are easy to find and order on Amazon. In a perfect world, it would be nice to have a retractable cord and a sturdier hose that doesn't kink so easily. But for the price this is an excellent choice for cleaning hard wood floors and the attachments are very handy for cleaning the car.

It has a HEPA filter, which was a must for us, and it comes with useful accessories for vacuuming furniture and dog beds.  We also use it on our hardwood floors and stairs to suck up dog hair.  It's a compact machine ideal for smaller homes.
My one complaint is that the speed/flow reversing rotary knob has a very flimsy feel for a fan of the price.

My only concern is the pressure cap that sits on top and rocks with the steam. The  reason I say I am concerned is because it could get lost on a boat easily. If I were to order a Nother one I might try to find one that doesn't have a detachable piece.

1768	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Our kitchen has very poor lighting, so needed some way to brighten things up. We decided that under cabinet lighting would be the best way to go, and selected these. We got three of them, which covers all of the counterspace. Easy to install, although we opted to use double stick tape instead of screwing them in (otherwise screws would have protruded into cabinet shelf). Quality is what we expected for the price, nothing fancy, but does the job.

- Makes your skin very wet and takes a few minutes to dry.
Cooked once with it and the food tasted funny.
The only big "con" is how loud it is. Think "jet taking off on the runway."  The neighbors will hear you vacuuming. Not just the next door neighbors. The ones half a mile down the street. It is LOUD! It is so loud that each time I use it, I notice it. I plan to use earplugs the next time. But it is worth that minor inconvenience for all the other excellent features. GREAT suction; as good as my big Eureka that cost at least 4 times as much.

5840	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great little vacuum for my purpose.  It's a bit noisy, but I expected that with the great power and small size and price.  I haven't used the floor attachment, just the brush attachment to vacuum up heavy polishing dust in a jewelry store.  I'm also very happy with the fact that it stores easily in the bottom of a kitchen cabinet.
4072	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment. This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top. It even has a  built in mechanism so it can't overflow. I liked its performance overall  and found it as good, if not better then other household machines. Of  course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it's  an economical product that isn't a problem either. The best feature it has  is two separate tanks which means you won't end up cleaning your sofa with  dirty water. Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself  in one use.
4707	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Awesome for quick pick up when you don't want to get out a corded vac.  Make sure to use it and run the batteries down or they go bad if not used.  This is my second one.  If you need batteries they are $20 each and this vac is only $50 with two batteries so it is almost cheaper to buy batteries this way and get a new vacuum.

3471	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this pressure cooker in January of 2013 and have had nothing but trouble with it.  The second time I used it, before it even started to hiss, the pressure plug blew.  I ordered a new plug, but it will not build up enough pressure to even jiggle the regulator.  I know that the problem is not my stove, because the stove is brand new and I use my big All-American canner on a lot, with no problems at all.  I tried to order the glass cover so I could at least use it as a regular pan, but the part number IN THE PRESTO BROCHURE does not work ON THE PRESTO WEBSITE.  Presto may be the bestselling pressure cookers, but it has to be because they don't cost much, because it surely is not because they are great quality.  If they were half the price, it would still be a waste of money.

- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK. This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.
Clean-up isn't difficult.  I wash it by hand even though it is considered dishwasher-safe.  The top can be soaked in hot soapy water to get it thoroughly cleaned.

4837	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Cooking over a grill in South Florida can be a miserable experience in the summer. I wanted a small fan to hang over my grill to blow the smoke and heat away from my face, and this fan exactly fit the bill. It's small enough that I can direct it at my face and upper body, so that it's cooling me and not the grill. The front and rear shrouds and the blade assembly are all plastic, so corrosion will not be an issue. The fan slides into a small bracket that mounts to the wall, so it can easily be taken off the wall, either to clean the fan or to hose down the porch.

It doubles as a bookmark.

9803	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great spinner.  Replaced a cheap Ikea one that finally died.  Solid, sturdy and gets the salad very dry.
I'm glad I changed my mind.  It's super for quickly making beans and brown rice which otherwise take so long.  Meat browns easily in the pan and then, when sealed, those cuts of beef, pork, or chicken cook and tenderize in a flash to be used in burritos, enchiladas, or pasta meals.  Everything cooks to perfection in just a fraction of the usual time.
I highly recommend this product - it's easy to assemble, a time saver...and a knee and back saver too! The only drawback is the excess fluid it leaves behind to be wiped up.

We make our own pizzas (with the dough from scratch) and bake them on pizza stones.

Was kept in good condition so after 2 days of use belt broke ( the original factory belt) so I look up the numbers on Amazon for replacement ( and google) and my goodness...i could not find a match on serial or modle number . Even this one didn't match nor the vacuum modle but it was closest match I could find. It worked!! Though so that's the reason for 5 stars.
4588	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this to replace my 2 year old yellow Mighty Mite canister. I gave that old MM vac a 5 star bec for the price it was just as good as my Old Miele, had 2 Miele and both did not last 10 years.  What went wrong with the old MM? The hose was kinked due to faulty  storing position, then it was probably clogged somewhere down the hose bec it was not sucking well. Anyway, I did not think it was worth troubleshooting or buying a new hose esp. when I came across a good replacement better for pet fur.  I like the overall performance, the reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is bec the floor tool kept coming off the telescopic extension wand.  I have emailed eureka.com.  Waiting for their response.
9268	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	If you're straining stock or broth, this is a real time saver.  You don't need to bother with cheesecloth -- this double rod strainer gives you a very clear product.  It's nicely made, and will probably last a long time.

The Lasko 3720 and 3721 also look a bit different than the Aerospeed BX100, so looks may be another deciding factor for you.
As far as convenience the crevice tool and brush tool for blinds etc. stores right underneath the handle area for easy access. The Eureka has a storage area for the crevice tool that is a hollow insertion area on top of the motor itself requiring that you bend over to the floor every time you want to access it.

Don't forget to soak the wooden bucket prior to using or all the water leaks out. Great machine but not certain if I would buy another one due to the loud motor noise.

Installation wasn't hard thought I recommend using 2 people. It'll be much easier that way.

This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient, it's durable, it's just plain a good product, and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item.

8687	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great all-around strainer/sieve.  I don't have a zillion kitchen gadgets, so I love it when I find one that can multi-task like this strainer.  It is double-meshed with fine meshing, so it can handle most particulates.  It is also big enough to handle large volumes of stock, etc.  It seems sturdy enough to last a good, long time, too.

5937	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	my main concern for this vac was power. well it does not lack any. I use it for bare floor cleaning and stairs and it does well at both. I also use it to clean my window sills, and and the bags can be found cheap

I think I may move the Eureka out to the garage for using it to clean the car so the smell from the poorly filtered air has a chance to escape instead of being blown into the inside air of my bedroom etc. Have I tried every vacuum out there? Of course not, but I do have the Miele Compact C2 Quartz Canister Vacuum in Lotus white that is over 2.6 times the price of this Bessell with all of the same exact features except it is not a bagless. That is why I jumped at the opportunity to have a go with this one.
4744	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is probably my favorite piece of cookware - it's even better than a crock pot. When you can make beef stew - start to finish in 30 minutes, it's perfect for working moms. It's easy to use and to clean. I really like that I can use frozen meat if I've forgotten to take something out to thaw. You just add a few minutes more per pound to the cooking time. Most regular recipes are easily adapted for use in the pressure cooker. I've made roasts, chicken soup, etc. I highly recommend this cooker.
6453	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	ok
7700	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works great but a bit of a pain to clean after each use.
The good: Incredible suction. I've had one for 18 months of brutal usage, and as long as you change the filter and bag - it just works incredibly well. It's light - the lightest canister I've ever seen. It's durable - its taken many a spill, and not one bit has chipped or cracked and it still works like new. And it's cheap. So cheap. Same may say it feels cheap, and it doesn't feel like a $1000 vac, but did I mention how nothing has broken or chipped on it despite hitting the hard tile numerous times?
2675	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Works well. A bit messy to depressurize if you're in a rush, but otherwise seems to be a good product.

Space usage / appearance:  It lies flat, on the back side / up against your window (this design is what allows you to slide the window closed- & locked- behind it).  In the front, the grill (& center control knob) extends out into the room about 7".  The side panels offer great privacy.  The entire unit is off-white / cream-colored / neutral.  It looks retro-designer/ mid-century, a bit industrial-looking maybe.  I've searched for 17 years, & this is by FAR the best fan I've ever found.  Worth every penny & more.  If you're on the fence, buy it!  No doubt you'll find a use for it!  PS- I believe it's generally recognized that this is the same exact item/product as the Air King brand 16" Window Fan, which is priced much higher.  Get this Lasko while you can!

6718	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	The brackets I received were made well but I had to shim the upright pieces C to keep them from wobbling in the bracket. I also cut the pieces marked A, which I also had to shim about 18 inches longer to give the wood rack more stability. The lumber I used was a cheap grade of 2x4 not pressure treated which accounts for the shimming. Personally I'd rather have the slots in the bracket this size than too small.  Please note:  this is my second purchase of this product.
I don't run it every day, it's a summer thing around here. But I do leave it running all night, so the older one has a fair number of hours on it.

My stovetop will not turn on while trying to use this cooker. Ugh! (I just found out that a magnet will not stick to my cooker, either, and all these years I thought it was stainless steel!.). The new cooktop is the only reason I'm looking to buy a new cooker.  So many great reviews about this cooker and so many say it is stainless steel; therefore, I'm buying it again hoping to get one that is actually stainless steel and will work on my new stove.

It is less than a month old and has been used to make 5 single quart batches of ice cream.  I can't believe that the manufacturer would allow such cheap parts to be used in a $200 "commercial grade" motor. When it did work, the ice cream was amazing. I'm just glad it's still in warranty.

I did replace it with the same and the second has worked great, very easy to change the filters now that I have the hang of it, I have never had a problem of leaks (knock on wood).  It has come to the end of it's 5 year life, it's doing great but I want to replace it now before it might crack and flood my basement again!
2283	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this fan on August 31, 2014. Paid $93.30, no shipping fee. I received the fan after 10 days as it was shipped back to original shipper by UPS. When it did arrive, the box was destroyed but fan appeared to be ok. I installed it early this morning in an upstairs window in my studio. In order to install the unit, you have to mark the places on the sides where the fan will attach to your window frame. Then you must drill the four holes to put the screws into. Screws not included. After drilling, align the slots with the holes, put in screws and tighten screws. This is not difficult but you will have four holes in your inside window frame.  Took me about 20 minutes. Turned fan to exhaust hi; opened two windows; one on opposite wall about 6 feet away, the other at end of upstairs studio about 30 feet away. Let fan run for 2 hours on exhaust. NOTHING. stood in front of window furthest from unit; no air moving through window. Went to window nearest unit, no air moving through window. I turned the unit from exhaust to blow on high. You cannot even feel the air blowing 4 feet away. This is NOT A whole house fan.  very WEAK. Will never get the job done. I do not know when they changed this fan, but the reviewers on this page cannot be talking about this unit.

7077	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased my electric White Mountain ice cream freezer in 1993.  One of the reduction drive gears finally wore out in the head unit.  Like other reviewers, I'm finding that you cannot purchase components (bushings, gear sets, etc.) to repair these great old ice cream makers.  An electric head unit (motor and drive assembly) can be purchased, but they're cheap Chickity-China garbage!!  Hand crank units are still available, but I've heard the late model ones also have cheap Chinese made gear sets (some plastic) and will not last for more than a few batches of ice cream!  What a shame this company is trading off the old reliable reputation of one the last traditional American made products.  Guess I'll just have to design my own drive unit.
Glad I bought it.
2669	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Safe and Affordable . That said using this pressure cooker without reading the included information will generally produce unfortunate results. Meaning, too much or too little water, too long of a cooking time, or too high of heat for too long of a time will discourage most first time users. Most people remember the cautions of their parents or grand parents that these things can blow up...not likely! If you do a little homework you'll be able to produce many a fine dish...Find yourself a blog, or talk to anyone you know who uses one, do an internet search on pressure cookers and jump in...

Conclusion: would not buy again
3631	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use.  Good size
Highly recommend it.
Cons: The bad and the reason I deducted one star is a complete lack of bass.  They are very clear and sound great but there simply isn't any low end.  That being said, I kind of expected it since the drivers in small headphones aren't meant to have the boom of larger, audiophile headphones but I was still nonetheless surprised that they really didn't have any bass to speak of.
That said, keep in mind, everyone is rating this unit 4-5 stars, and few have actually had a 'test situation' where you can actually address how it truly performs. It's like having a set of car tires that have never had a flat, because you've never been off-road or in rough areas, and yet you rate them as 'tough-as-nails on the trail'...how would you know?

5953	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I have had this vacuum for about a year and a half. I don't use it much. The suction is good but the metal wand pieced get stuck together. Eurekq replaced them once several months ago but I still have the same problem. I've tried oiling the pieces where they come together but they still get locked on. Tried WD 40 and other oils. I have to put boiling water on the joint to get them apart. I don't have strong hands but this is ridiculous. Definitely a design flaw which Eureka has no interest in fixing. They probably have a new model by now but beware; my impression is that they don't think this is a major problem. It's not all that great on pet hair either.

Overall, a must-have kitchen tool that does an awesome job. Simple, but incredibly effective.
Only flaw is when you install the HEPA filter - it's no longer level in the upright position.
First of all, there wasn't much circulation of air in the summer.  All the windows were on the West side...one in the bathroom, two in the living room and one in the kitchen/dining area and if the wind was coming from any direction that wasn't West, it could pretty steamy in the place.

Being Stainless, it is a snap to clean up, although I don't have space to put it away- so it sits on my stove (that I don't uses anymore because I got the induction cooktop)  If you have never done cooking with a pressure cooker, this is a great way to get into it.  Try it, you will not go wrong!
I only ever had one other Eureka.  Sadly, I gave it to someone, who probably stil has it.
9207	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It worked great for me, much better than my very old plastic one.
This pressure cooker does not have a gauge and the weight is not marked 5, 10, 15 as I remember pressure cookers having.  It has an instruction booklet with it.  It contains suggested cooking time.  It does have a gasket.  It is always a good idea to check and make sure it is in place before cooking.  It has a safety release rubber valve that will blow out should it gain too much pressure.  It also has a release valve at the handle that drops so that you know it is safe to remove the weight on top.

7786	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I had a great crank-style salad spinner that was getting old and also was really tough to use due to my arthritis.  I researched new salad spinners and watched an online video where they tested salad spinners and named this the best one, specifically noting that this one was great for arthritics.  That may be true but it doesn't dry the lettuce.  The spin appears feeble and pressing the button more doesn't make it spin any faster.  It takes longer and still I have to dry the lettuce by hand.  Plus the hard plastic bowl scratches extremely easily.  I imagine it wouldn't take long for this one to look as old as my previous one did and I had that for years.
Recently, it seems Eureka are using a different kind of switch; the older one had a very stiff but firm click on/off. The new one is not as positive feeling; hopefully it will last as long as the original. Nothing else appears to have changed.

In the past, it was always been worth paying a little extra for Tupperware because of the superior quality of the Tupperware brand, as well as the lifetime guarantee.  With this order, however, I noticed that the plastic feels slightly thinner and more brittle than the Tupperware containers I bought 20 years ago.  I actually took some of the older containers out and did a side-by-side comparison, and I liked the older ones better.  I'm afraid the containers may not be as durable as they used to be, but they still seem to be very durable.  Tupperware is still superior to most plastics, but the quality of Rubbermaid has improved over the years, and Rubbermaid is much less expensive.  If my Rubbermaid fails, I just throw it out and buy a new one.

Until it gets ripped out, this is my only option.  A much less expensive alternative to high priced vacuums.  I've ruined 2 Dysons, and countless others. Never again!

I'm not sure how this unit will perform as the temps get colder. I'm hoping for great results. One caution is to keep it plugged into a circuit that is not used, especially if your circuits are 1500 amps.

Next item up for bid, the wand. On the Eureka you have this long, fixed plastic tube that does allow you to pull the sections apart and store them on the couch for those times when you need a longer reach. The BMC has this beautiful stainless steel telescoping wand/tube that has no such problems. It retracts and extends anywhere along its reach with the locking dots all along the shaft. So there is no having to take anything apart, and place sections around the room that you have to go and find when you want to extend the Eureka. This also is a huge advantage for storage. My one complaint about the Eureka is that it takes up a lot of closet space with the long fixed plastic tube plus the long flexible tube. This BMC with the push of the collar collapses the stainless steel tube into a length that is about half of the space of the Eureka.

They are $22 a piece plus shipping so essentially while the vacuum has a one year warranty, when you figure in the price of the replacement batteries (I don't have my warranty papers but surely batteries are not covered)... it's just easier to buy a new one...but every 7 months? hmmm

2391	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Having a small kitchen and not a great exhaust, solutions like fan windows are great, but all too often they are small and have to sit below the window. That means that when it rains or cold out, you have to remove the fan to close the window. This fan stays in the window year round but allows you to open and close the window without having to remove the fan!  Not only that, it's very powerful and VERY quiet.

The print 'sticker' stays on well & the magnets were easy to pull apart without tearing.
These "orange crochet hooks" really peel an orange easily.  Watch out for the garbage disposal, though!
After getting this and using it a few times I have to say it met all my expectations. After using an upright primarily, it does take some getting used to, using the long handles/tubes. However, the way it swivels actually makes it quite easy to get under vehicles as you can get it almost flat to the ground. The suction is very good, on par with our small shop-vac, and is able to suck up leaves and small rocks easily. I also wanted something with a hose, and this works well, as with the hose and the long extensions, I am able to reach up to the corners of our 10 foot high ceiling to remove cobwebs and their designers. Some people may not like having to use bags to collect and dispose of debris, however bags were my preference for the garage. That way, any little insects or critters I vacuum up are somewhat contained. I probably only do a thorough cleaning of the garage a couple of times a year, so to me it's not big deal to just throw the bag afterwards even if it isn't completely full. The bags average less than $1 a piece, and I will probably only use about 3 a year.

6097	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've owned Might Mite Canister Vacuums for the past 30 years.  This vacuum is very inexpensive so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Well it really "sucks", pun intended.  I can't complain about the power of the product, it is fantastic.  If I could just put the motor in my 30 year old case.  The case is very cheap.  The on/off button is built into the case and I don't believe it will stand the test of time.  The flexible tubing is so cheap it bends and cuts off air flow and the connector to the canister is different from previous models (I own three) so I can't just change the hose.  The combo brush tool is a joke, don't bother just buy another full sized brush and upholstery tool.  I do like how they put the attachments on the case.  The included crack and crevice tool is always handy and the floor brush feels durable and works very well.

I went out and got a Microplane (this one, because it doesn't have cutting edges on the sides and I'm a klutz:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microplane-Fine-Grater/dp/B00004S7VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microplane Fine Grater</a>) and was an instant convert.  Yes, the photo was very probably a single-swipe one.  With the Microplane, it's really easy to get every last shred of zest from an orange -- without a single iota of pith! -- in about the same amount of time it takes to simply peel an orange.  Wow.

8695	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	BEWARE! an BE CAREFUL! Along with the best peeler out there comes a danger. Because the thing IS sharp as a razor I have cut my finger tips 3 times when peeling potatoes. You have to hold the potato tightly with the other hand and it's very hard to keep your fingers out of the way. A clean cut wouldn't be so bad but this takes a little chuck of flesh out of your finger tip if you nick it. I would go so far as to say don't use it for potatoes!

Putting it together took awhile because I did it on my own (yes that's right, didn't need my husband's help at all :D) but the instructions were easy to understand and it was easy to assemble. It's good quality, sturdy and visually appealing. The only reason that I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because it doesn't have plate grooves on it like it says in the description. But other than that, I love it. I put all my spices, microwave and other things on it. There's enough room in the bottom compartment for 8 one gallon water jugs. Great purchase.
6155	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	We have had the green MM for 20+ years and have been extremely happy.  It was purchased for small jobs - between appliances, baseboards, dry spills, car, upholstery, etc.  It still does the job, but the handle broke after dropping it so decided to purchase another MM because of the reviews on this site and past experience with the product.  Like other reviewers, I'm happy with the performance of this inexpensive and lightweight vacuum.  When I first opened the packaging, my first thought was that it was flimsy compared to my old MM.  However, the suction is excellent.  The cons are:  handle heats up after a few minutes; the floor attachment could use improvement in design and size (willing to pay more for the improvement). I prefer the attachments of my green MM so I use those instead.  Purchased this for small jobs and for use on tile floors - kitchen, bath and laundry room - and it does the job. For the floors, I previously had the Electrolux battery-operated 2 in 1 and recently purchased a Hoover Floormate.  I liked the concept and ease of use of the Electrolux, but I felt a loss of suction after a couple of years. The Hoover is just bah-humbug to use and pretty much picks up only dust. I am very happy with the MM.

this vac picks up all their bundles of hair well, the head for the hardwood vaccing has little stubs of brushes on it and they have to be picked clean every once in a while when you are vaccing because they clump up a bit.

3197	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I love a good 'ol fashioned pressure cooker. When my 40+ year old Presto recently gave up the ghost, I knew I had to get another. Sometimes, I might not use it but 4 or 5 times in a year, but it's one of those kitchen tools that when you need it--YOU NEED IT. This new Presto works fine, the problem is the assembly screws. I don't know what it takes to get these screws tightened enough to hold, but whatever it is, I don't seem to have. The result is that the handles wobble and the connection between pot and lid is compromised. Not sure what to do to resolve this. I'm winding up re-tightening my screws every time I use this. What a hassle!
Tip:  I have pure essential oils in my home because those don't aggravate my allergies and asthma...I put a few drops of Lavender Oil onto the bag where I knew it wouldn't contact the plastic (just in case) and now when I vacuum there is a light, clean smell that accompanies it...it actually makes me want to whip out the vacuum more frequently!  ;-)

1882	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Not so good.  I match the model against my model pressure cooker.  Tried it and the steam leaked out like a geyser.

5098	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	If your scrutinize all the text there's a hint that these are not genuine Hoover bags - "OEM compatible" a rather inscrutable message. None the less, the Genuine Hoover package is shown, but you'll get some 3rd party knock off that is a thinner bag material.  I didn't read the reviews - for god's sake, it's a $5 package of vac bags clearly pictured as Genuine Hoover - I've had my fill of exploding-in-the-vacuum 3rd party bags, the genuine article isn't that much more.

I was disappointed that the rack was aluminum and not stainless steel. I emailed the company and they responded promptly. The reason it is aluminum is to keep down the price. I feel the price is fair and that is a good reason to have that type of insert. I gave it five stars because of performance and price, in spite of wishing that the insert were stainless steel.

5096	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I have a love-hate relationship with this vac. I hate that it is so cheaply made; it is literally a DustBuster on a stick. The filter is difficult to put back in place after you empty the dirt and if you don't get it just right, you can't lock the dust cup back on.  I can't imagine it holding up long enough to need the extra battery pack.  But I love how helpful it is!  I have white tile floors and two big dogs, and this thing makes it so easy to pick up dirt they track in as well as leaves and bits of food they leave behind. My daughter has the Dyson cordless and it is built much better, but it costs 4X as much with every discount and coupon we could find and its function is about the same as my Eureka. I am not sure if there is a happy medium between the two, but I couldn't find one.

2280	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	The engineer who designed this fan is an idiot.  I am willing to bet this engineer never installed a fan ever!  The fan itself is good, but the mounting is awful, the mounting tabs are backwards.  The fan is designed to be mounted from the outside.  I cutoff the mounting tabs and drilled my own mounting holes right thru the housing.
I would say the highlight so far in its use has been the creation of split pea soup with a ham bone.  Previously I've made the soup in a pot and just let it cook away for a couple of hours.  This generally results in a soup with peas that retain some individuality, like lentils, that after being refrigerated combine into that large split pea mass I love.  In the pressure cooker after half an hour the split peas literally fall completely apart and form into the semi solid mass that I usually don't attain until I'm eating it as left overs.  Fantastic.  Not to mention quick corned beef, speedy stocks, and delightful beans and brown rice.
7582	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I needed a knife like the OXO Good Grips Spreader in order to easily spread peanut butter on bread.

Price is very reasonable and delivery is quick using Amazon.com.
1114	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I use incredible amounts of garlic and even though I don't enjoy washing the chamber but using this to chop garlic beats both my garlic press and knife. Granted it leaves soem chunks to big but that is a small price to pay for ease and speed I also use it to make bread crumbs out of croutons.  It is great for making smaller amounts of salad dressing ( I make homemade caeser dressing in here- enough for a dinner party). I will even use it to do a really quick beating to egg whites. I am not a big gadget person but this is a much have in my kitchen. The immersion blender that comes with the chopper bowl attachment is a suitable alternative if you already have that.
9589	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a basis and relatively cheap masher.  I bought this to replace an identical one which bend after mashing sweet potatoes.

I bought two of them and the handle broke on both of them within a year.  I would recommend this sweeper for in between cleaning jobs.  The bonus battery pack is a great idea.  You don't have to stop, plug in and wait until it recharges.  The only thing that I don't like is the fact that you can not go under low furniture because of the way it is built.

I tested it on my hardwood floors (which are original pine and very uneven, with wide cracks), my slate floors (also bumpy and uneven)  and on my newly carpeted (very light beige) bedroom floor.  The Eureka was beyond my expectations on both surfaces.  I am used to seeing some specs left behind on the hard floor surfaces and carpet after I use my very expensive Dyson vacuum.  However, the Eureka cleaned up everything and the battery has lasted as long as needed to get a few rooms done.  I plan to buy another for downstairs and keep this upstairs.  Good-bye regular dust busters!!

It's the genuine hoover product, not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever, when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly.

4486	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	For the price, you honestly can't go wrong.  I have purchased some very expensive vacuums over the years and I honestly don't believe they are worth the money.  This vacuum is great on hardwood floors (doesn't scratch them at all) and does well on our area rugs as well.  I bought this vacuum from Amazon almost four years ago and it's still going strong.  I even knocked it off of a high wooden chair I had it sitting on while I was changing the bag and it just bounced - no broken parts.  If I were to complain about anything, I wish the wand pieces had buttons that helped it stay together.  If you take the wand apart often (to maybe get in crevices or hard to reach places, etc .) it tends to sometimes come apart while you're using it.  Other than that, I think it's top notch.  And when it goes out, if it ever does, I'll replace it with the exact same vacuum.

2765	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Sometimes you need a pressure cooker/canner for small things, and the 23 quart canner you bought a few years ago qualifies as ridiculous overkill.

Plus it's stainless steel, so you can cook acidic foods in it with no worries.

Another thing I must mention is that this makes me more interested in seeing 8Mile, the upcoming movie Shady is doing.  "Cleaning Out My Closet" is featured in the trailer, and "The Kiss" skit sounds it's from the movie rather than a standalone skit, but I could be wrong.  Regardless, if there are any good tracks that Eminem was holding out for the movie, and if they're the same quality as this effort, it should be worth seeing, or at least getting the soundtrack.

I gave this OXO knife away to Value Village.  It was almost useless.
You can buy a cheaper unit, pay maybe half as much.  But wanted stainless steel, maybe it will last 50 years like my other one.  I'll settle for 5 years without problems though.

In short, this Lasko 2155a has met my expectations.  If I turn it on high exhaust, open a couple windows on the opposite end of the apartment, and close the rest, it does a great job of pulling in fresh (cool!) air.  Of course it's not as fast or as powerful as a real attic whole-house fan, but especially given the price, convenience, and simple installation, it's a pretty good substitute.  It shouldn't even be in the same category as the little twin window fans - those are good for a single room, but they don't hold a candle to this Lasko.  When this is running on high exhaust, and with only a few other windows open, there's a noticeable breeze coming in those windows.  I notice a distinct change in the coolness and "freshness" of the inside air after only a few minutes.  It is pretty loud when it's on high, but it's not the obtrusive roar that I've seen described in other reviews.  I wouldn't want to sit right next to it and have a conversation or listen to music, but if you're in the next room, it's really not distractingly loud.  Also, I find it's helpful to leave this on high for a few (10-15?) minutes, and then turning it to low does a fine job of maintaining the fresh air inside.  When it's on low, the noise isn't bad at all - it's quieter than the oscillating stand fan I'd use otherwise.  Not distracting or bothersome, even if you're in the same room.

Ever since "The Slim Shady LP", this exhibitionist with a heart of gold has been carving out his own artistic territory - a kaleidoscopic synthesis of music, poetry, suffering, bad potty training, bad relationships, and above all, theater.  In the context of the stage show - look at the cover:  MM on stage in front of a closed curtain; now you see him, now you don't - this album is an a report from the field, so to speak, of the evolving Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers/Eminem personna, which is, after all, the slippery subject of all the art (is it enough to call it music?).

This is nice if you have some items you might not want other to be able to access, or just for storage. I personally use it for storage. The latching mechanism has the hinge on the bottom side. This is especially useful because when lifting up on the handles the latches cannot be accidentally opened by upward pressure from your hands. This ensures the lid will stay latched down and keep what is inside, inside.

The flatware is very thin so the knife really has no cutting power (even for a butter knife) behind it. HOWEVER, for the price I paid, I can't expect anything else. They are pretty stylish at a glance but if you're looking to do anything that requires a durable utensil, this isn't the one you want.
1240	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I use this all the time to chop up nuts, grate hard cheeses, and make small batches of hot sauces.

Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year.

Wasn't sure how they would hold up in the dishwasher, which is crucial for me as I already have more than enough items to hand wash, but they are doing great.  They really do make a seal and you can pick up the bowl underneath by lifting the tap in the center of the disk (?) if the contents are not too heavy.  Had fun playing with them with a three year old who was fascinated with how they would pick up the bowl... or seemingly stick to the counter... before their first wash.  She was so proud showing me how if you pull straight up it's stuck good, but if you pick it up from the side it's like it was never stuck at all.  I'm sure if you damage the smooth under-surface, it's game over, but no problems so far.

It cooks just like my 6 quart. It's weighty without weighing a ton. Couple things: the tray inside is flimsy and it discolors. Also, the bottom handle that helps lock the cooker twists when the pot gets hot -- no matter how tightly I screw it on. Presto needs to rethink that. That handle should be riveted like my old pot. It makes it harder to seal and unseal.

+  It's simple to use.  Just follow directions for timing in the included cookbook.  It is great for dried beans, and also for fresh vegetables with long standard cooking times like artichokes. Those items cook in literally just a few minutes, and they come out more tender and better tasting. It also made great chicken broth from bones and scraps in a very short time.  It does NOT waste a lot of steam, just make sure the small rubber stopper and steel pressure plug is free to move.  It heats up quickly, then when the old school 'jiggler' starts to rock, turn the pressure down so that it rocks slowly.  Using the basic cook times provided in the included cooking guide has worked fine. It's easy to judge from the rocker noise and safe.
The stainless steel is easy to clean and the aluminium bottom spreads the heat evenly. Our 6qt cooker has a small handle on each side, unlike the one pictured today (14th July) with one big handle. It's the same diameter as the 8 qt., so the basket from our 8 qt. fits inside - it's better for lifting things out.

Okay - the positive - The  Hoover bags do a superior job of trapping fine and itty-bitty dust  particles. But I do wish they'd figure out how to make bag removal and  installation easier. Or just make the bag a different shape so you're not  contorting it to get it into the allotted space.

I love the large surface area of this potato masher -- much better than a fork -- and the holes are small enough that the beans don't slip through.  It's much more thorough than mashing with a fork, as well, resulting in fewer large chunks and a smoother texture.  It also works quite well for mashing potatoes and sweet potatoes (even if I put a little garlic in).  It's not perfect when it comes to mashing roasted winter squash, but I think that has more to do with the texture of the squash than it does with the potato masher.

This Presto model is safe because it won't open while still under pressure.  If you're pressed for time, you can run cold water over the lid or set the pan in cold water to drop the pressure more quickly.  When filled, it is a bit heavy and it take two hands for me to carry it.

I've been using these units to cool my condo for 2 years (starting my third summer now).  The unit is a corner loft with giant windows facing all along the south and west walls, so it gets solid sunlight from sunup to sundown with no AC.  Placing one unit as exhaust and one as intake drops the ambient air temperature of the condo by about 20-25 degrees (F) during the summer, which is tremendous.  These units move some serious air --  setting both units on either setting has a huge impact on the ambient air pressure, such that the front door becomes difficult to manage.

5790	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great little vacuum! I bought this and a floor steamer at the same time to clean the hard floors now that my baby is getting ready to start crawling. It also doesn't hurt that we have a split level house, and I HATE trying to vacuum stairs with a standard upright vac. They're bulky, hard to maneuver, and heavy. This little guy weighs practically nothing, has good suction, has the hepa filter, and rolls along nicely. Yes, it does use bags, and I haven't had it long enough to know if finding them is an issue, though I've read the other reviews on here about finding them on this site, so I'm not too worried. To me, the only real advantage to bagless over bagged is that you can see (in all its disgusting glory) how full your bagless canister is and you have to open this guy up to see how full the bag is. And if your canister looks as gross as mine does (seriously, where DOES all that lint and hair come from?!) you may or may not count that as an advantage.

I actually read the entire manual before putting the pot together and I remember reading on the FAQ'S that if the lid is hard to close, you just need to press down the opposite side of the lid (the helper handle side) with one hand while sliding the handle with your other hand.

I've used this zester on oranges, lemons and limes. It works excellently for creating spiral twists on oranges and lemons. Limes are tougher to work with, though I can't say I've ever tried using a different zester on limes. Limes may just be tricker because the rinds are thinner. Overall, though, an excellent value for the money.

3953	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've been cooking with a Mirro 4-qt. pressure cooker for years - just like the one my mom had.  When I had trouble getting a replacement gasket that actually fit (the one that is supposed to fit is not wide enough) I decided to just upgrade my cooker.  I went for the Presto 6 quart stainless steel one - stainless was just a few $$ more than the aluminum - and I'm so glad I did.  Not only is is a heavier pot but it cleans up so easily and is so much better looking than the aluminum one.  I had to attach the handles when I got it which was very easy and the pot works perfectly.  It comes up to pressure much faster than my old Mirro and, even though the jiggler is different from my old pot, makes a very pleasant noise while cooking.  I love this pressure cooker and cannot recommend it highly enough.

You must dry it immediately after washing, so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes, but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also, the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.

3069	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I never knew the joys of cooking in a pressure cooker until I bought one and used it. If you're a first timer to the pressure cooker world like I was, it's a little intimidating, and rightfully so. You basically spend the entirety of your first time using this thing thinking it's going to explode on your stove. Read the instructions and make sure you use the lowest possible heat to keep it pressurized and you'll be good. Wash well before use as well, it comes with some kind of lubricant in the lid that the instructions tell you to wash off first.

I love pulled pork, beef, and chicken - I first smoke the meat on my pellet grill, then move over to the pressure cooker to tenderize and finish it off.  I can't imagine any more finishing off the meat on the grill with aluminum pans/foil - what a time waster, and the result has never been as good as this pressure cooker.  Just add apple juice for pork, I add a beer and V8 juice for beef... Chicken is super easy too...

6625	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I used these to construct a fire wood holder that is 4' x 10' and it was very useful.  You will need to brace the top with additional 2x4 studs to form a full rectangle, but using the brackets on the ground section allowed a useful foundation.  I placed mine on concrete blocks 2" thick and it worked fine.
2513	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm a smoker in a small 1100 square foot house and was tired of the lingering smoke, yellowed papers, drapes, etc. I live in Florida and the humidity is killer so it's not real productive to open windows to vent. I ordered 2 of these 16" fans and boy are they big! They work incredibly well. I use one as an intake (High pressure area) and the other as an exhaust (Low pressure area). I can also turn both fans to exhaust and my whole house is clear as a bell, smells fresh, not a wisp of smoke anywhere, in only 2 minutes. 2 minutes! I had spent almost $1,000 for 2 Ionic Breeze Quadras and they couldn't do in hours what these 2 fans did for $130 in 2 minutes! These fans are a godsend! I actually could have easily gotten by with 2 of the 9" fans instead. I'll probably order 2 of them to use for the winter/spring months then have these 16" bad boys for the summer/fall months. I can imagine these fans would be heavenly for people with pets, cigar smokers, for cooking strong smelling foods like fish, etc. As you can see I am pleasantly surprised and very happy on my purchases. Also love the fact that the fans are both intake/exhaust. Great product, thank you.
Conclusions:  Nice lightweight little vac for the money.  In fact will save me money because I won't have to have the armchair reupholstered after all. Great on bare floors.  Easier to lug up and down stairs than its predecessor.  The Hepa filter is a big plus. Nonetheless, I still find that pet hair--at least surface pet hair on deeper pile rugs--picks up more easily by skimming a damp sponge mop over them  first,  then using a vac to quickly grab the globs of hair pulled up and left behind by the mop.  Also I still find the simplest way to get hair and other stuff out of throw rugs and comforters is to let the clothes dryer and a dryer sheet have at them on a no-heat cycle.

Finally, they changed the on-off switch.  It used to be mechanical -- there was a tactile sensation and a 'click' that went with turning it on.  The new switch LOOKS the same but doesn't work the same.  You start to press it and the machine is suddenly on.  But if you haven't pressed it long enough, then the machine might turn off when you take your finger (or foot) away.  So then you do it again.

The "pet power paw" attachment is absolutely fantastic in getting the dog hair off the couch and stairs.  The "Floor Tool" that comes with it picks up well on non-carpeted areas.  On carpeting, it seems to "lump" the dog hair into a small pile and the starts rolling it around.  I  pull the floor tool off the end of the wand and use the wand to pick it up.  At first this is concerning, feeling as if it isn't picking up the hair well.  But it ends up doing a great job if you don't mind this extra step.  We have few fully carpeted rooms so it's not a problem for us, but if you have a fully carpeted house, you may want to reconsider.  There is a "carpet nozzle" available as an accessory, but if you research this at [...], you can see that what comes with the vacuum is a carpet/bare floor tool (10.99).  There is a 'bare floor nozzle' available for 29.99, but doesn't seem to be anything else for carpeting.  It would be great if Eureka could design a nozzle that functions the same as the "pet power paw" but in a wider design.

6200	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I have two active German Shepherds and the hair and dirt that accumulates around here sometimes is crazy. It just became too much for my old expensive upright. One thing my old upright was never great at was the hardwood floors, which makes up three quarters of my house.  This little sucker does not have that problem.  It is powerful and fabulous on the hardwoods, getting the hair and dirt with ease and as it is lightweight and mobile I can get through the whole house in a reasonably short period of time.  The reason I didn't go with five stars is that without a full sized rotating brush head it is not good on carpeting.  The small pet attachment is good for upholstery and maybe small rugs, but not for full carpeting and larger rugs.  It would take forever to do one carpeted room going a few inches at a time.  Also, the dog hair can really get ground in to the rugs and I need that large brush to loosen it up.  I am now researching whether Eureka sells a full sized brush head for this little guy that I can purchase.  It would be really helpful.  Meanwhile, this is a great little vacuum for most of my house and given how inexpensive it was, I am really happy with it.

5685	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The first time I used this vacuum on my hardwood floors, the suction was so powerful that it was a little hard to move along.  It calmed down after that and moves nicely along the floor now, and gets the dirt off the floors.  The vacuum head is small enough to get underneath small spaces, but not too small.  The handle is long so you don't have to bend down while vacuuming.  I like that the crevice tool is stored onboard.  It takes a few sessions to get used to handling the pivoting head, the long handle and the extension cord being stored underneath the canister, but it gets easier every time.  It is incredibly light for a well-functioning vacuum.  It's simple, light and gets the job done.

291	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Just as described.  Fast shipping.
The vacuum is great for a condo or a small house, a full charge can get you around 1000 sq. ft.  of cleaning done from my experience. It is easy to use and works very well. Make sure to empty the container once you see it getting full, I emptied about every 3 uses. The other version with the clear orange container is nice because you can see how full it was without taking it off. Come to think of it, I'll be keeping the dirt catcher from the old one too. Hair and fibers will tend to wrap themselves around the spinning brushes, but the simple design makes it easy to just slice them off with scissors or a box cutter if it gets too bad.


8304	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works like a charm every time. Have always been happy with my OXO purchases
This little vacuum cleaner has plenty of suction and it allowed me to clean the whole house without loosing suction.  After the first bag filled up I pulled it out and replaced it with a new one, simple, easy, done in no time at all.  It made cleaning the house a pleasure (for the first time), and I didn't have to stop to clean the filters like I would have with the bag-less cleaner.  It is so easy to maneuver it around the house you almost forget its following you.  The floor cleaning wand and nozzle take no effort at all to use, plus I can now get under the furniture without having to move anything around.  This vacuum cleaner is one I should have bought in the first place, not to mention the amount of money it would have saved me.  Very pleased with this unit, and also the super service from Amazon.
9785	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great quality!
This model is a smaller version of the 6-quart, so if you think this one is too small, that one would work for a family. This size is just right for one or two people. I always make very small quantities of food in it anyway as I don't like to have a lot of leftovers.
well its 5 years later and still hasn't blown up, use it every few months cooking beans mostly

The screws that came with ours are stainless so maybe they paid attention to the consumer! What a concept! Am thinking about a couple of accessories like the perforated tray that sits above the rest of the food to keep some separate, though so far we've only used it to cook black beans. And yes, we still soak them overnight before cooking.
8415	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my purposes. Rigid enough to handle heavier cheesecakes with ease. Nice angle for pie dishes. LOVE the double-sided serrating for righties or lefties (we so often get left out of product design considerations).

Every other spatula and scraper I have used, without exception, has a seam that separates the head from the handle.

I even have one scraper that has a removable handle which is convenient for cleaning but has the drawback of the handle coming loose at inopportune times.

It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to, which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent, but honestly, hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off, but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.

3474	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love my pressure cooker. I have always wanted to get into pressure cooking. This makes it so I can cook anything that I would usually cook in the crock pot in about an hour. That means if some tastey pulled pork sounds good for dinner, but I forgot to start the crock pot in the morning, no problem. The unit is also good quality, stamped aluminum. It seals well, and works great. It also has a safety lock so you can't open it under pressure.
THE FIXES for the AFOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS:
When looking for a replacement fan I found 2 of our fans were recalled in 2005 for fire hazard, so now I am replacing 3 fans. I guess in-plug mini-fuses became universal for a reason. Let's get started...
For the 6-quart Presto, I burnt my fingers a few times, from sticking a large pot into the sink, and the pot slightly tilted over, releasing hot steam from trivet.  After the 1st time, I turned off the heat, and left it there on the stove for 1/2 hour to decrease the pressure .. still burn myself as I pour the cold water to release the pressure.  The pot is too big for my sink, so it's easier to burn one's finger as I lifted that from the sink.  The pressure is VERY good with Presto.

9173	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I tried a couple other can openers, but this one is my favorite.  Cans are easy to open and it feels like it will last forever.

1275	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This coffee maker makes good coffee, but all the little parts, which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months, I couldn't get it out, even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off, when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.

Lesson:  Do not drop pressure cookers inverted on ceramic tile floors.  (Fortunately, it didn't damage the tiles!)

2444	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up.
I will buy again in the future.

1232	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I have had this for about a month now and I frequently use it. At first I thought it was broken because the blade would not start unless the cap clicks on completely and if its even just a tad off, it will not start. The blade on this thing is incredibly sharp, and quite frankly, a little scary to try and clean, (I've already cut myself trying to wash the blade). One slight problem I had with this is that that when the blade spins, it tosses everything in an upwards direction, making me having to often stop and try to push the food back down and sometimes I end up with the top of the food still in chunks while the bottom is pretty much disintegrated beyond recognition. Non the less, its still a pretty powerful machine!

So far this pressure-cooker seems to be super heavy-duty. We've used it to can salmon fish and every single can came out sealed to perfection. We were SO pleased! We've also used it for ribs and potatoes and they are soo good. We've turned tough peices of reindeer meat into butter with this thing. It's really perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better beginner kitchen accessory.

The thing I didn't like about it was it came with no directions so I never could figure out how to merge it with the rope lights I already have in place.
None of the three that we've owned have had any whining, squeaking, rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice, smooth hum.
One of the other most noteworthy things about the album is that it is more musically ambitious than the first two.  The tracks are still lyric-driven, but MM seems to be honing his own musical voice, and that means that his music is becoming distinguishable from the cookie-cutter gansta rap that has been, for him, merely a diving board.  This seems consistent with his first two albums, each of which was an innovation from everything that had come before it - whether in "rap" "pop" or whatever.

This is a powerful, but relatively quiet little machine. Fairly basic, but with all the necessary tools. The hose is long enough to reach the ceiling without effort. It's also removable and can be attached to the back of the machine to create a blower (not a very powerful blower, but a blower nonetheless). The suction is adjustable and far superior to that of an upright with attachments, which is exactly what I wanted. Works very well on bare floor and carpet too. Note, this does not have a beater bar, and don't think it was really designed for carpet only. So, it is not going to take dog hair, for instance, out of a carpet as well as a regular upright. For the purpose I need it for, it is wonderful.
3048	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My sister picked this one out and after watching her use hers, I couldn't wait to get my own. I've only used it once - but it was the best stew I've ever made and it took 10 minutes to cook the whole dinner. I've always been afraid of using a pressure cooker, but after learning how to use one and now using it (okay, I called my sister 5 times while using it to make sure I was dong it all right!), I don't know how I've lived without one all these years. I'm learning to be less afraid, but I will always respect the power of a pressure cooker. I follow all of the tips that come with it and that my sister pointed out - plenty of water and make sure the valves are all clean and clear. Excellent product for fast, delicious meals.
6130	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this vacuum cleaner because we had an old Mighty Mite vacuum cleaner at our camp and it was great. The only reason we had to purchase a new one was because the people staying at our camp took the mighty mite with them.  (I guess they decided it worked so well, they'd help themselves.) So...ordered a new mighty mite and was extremely disappointed.  The hose is so cheap, it kinks constantly. the attachments are equally as cheap. The vauum cleaner does not have much suction. It works terrible on rugs and you have to go over your floors multiple times to get anything sucked up.  It's a big bust and not worth the money. They definately don't make them like the used to.

UPDATE:  Think I've found out what's going on.  This item, which is supposed to provide 3 pieces is sold and shipped by Amazon, as is another "product" which consists of only 2 sections, also sold and shipped by Amazon.  Theu are almost the same price.  Looks like Amazon fills orders for either product, by shipping either product, be it two-pieces or three-pieces, regardless of what the customer specifies by choosing a specific product.  What is going on with this company?  When they send that guy or gal out into that huge factory, they should be matching the product pulled to one ordered, for Pete's sake. They must use electronic scanners for this, so someone needs to start instructing these people better or make an effort to verify that the product shipped actually IS the product ordered.

Update 11/07/08
6031	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I figured it was time to write a quick review after three years of regular use.  This Eureka Mighty Mite is a bit like the little engine that could - could clean up, could be easily carried, could make leaves blown into the garage go away, and could dispose of little balls of dust or dog hair.  Not only 'could' but 'does' quite effectively.  As my age progresses, it is getting more difficult to get certain household appliances from one room to another.  Not so with this little Eureka - small enough to store under a work bench in the garage, light enough to carry up the stairs.  Two areas of concern keep it from a five star rating:  it does not do a good job on dog hair on auto carpet.  It's larger cousin has to handle that job.  Additionally, the attachment hose jams up quite often.  That's easily fixed by running a long rod (like a skewer) through the hose to loosen up the debris.  Then it will usually just pick up where it left off.  Be sure not to go bonkers with the unjamming process - you don't want to poke a hole through the hose.  The main question:  does it do the job effectively?  Answer:  an absolute yes.
411	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Ok, everyone, it's about time that people put aside their doubts about Eminem's skills or staying power!  Slim Shady's third album, "The Eminem Show" proves once and for all that Mr. Mathers is extremely talented, in addition to being a lightning rod for controversy.  With his debut album in 1999, "The Slim Shady LP", it would easy to have written him off as another white rapper being a pretender to the throne of hip-hop greatness.  Even with catchy songs like "My Name is" and "Guilty Conscience" making loud noise on the Top-40 charts, critics were in a hurry to lump him with other 'Great White Hopes' that flamed out like Vanilla Ice (just a complete joke) and Snow (just never found an audience).  The success of his sophomore album, "The Marshall Mathers LP" shocked many and showed he had staying power, but the truth is, Eminem was destined for success from the start.

Unfortunately, one thing that I discovered with this latest model, is that the hose quality has deteriorated. The new hose is much softer and tends to kink easily.  One can hear by the sound of the motor that there is a kink in the line but it is such a nuisance constantly turning and trying to straighten the hose.  I'm glad that the hose connections remain the same since I switched out the hose from the older model since I plan to use that one upstairs where it will get less use.

They last, and they maintain a tight grip rather than losing their "spring" after repeated use.  Also, the relatively wide and flat surface on the business end does a better job than most alternatives at holding closed a wide-mouthed bag of pretzels, chips, etc.  The bright colors are also attractive, and the fact that they double as refrigerator magnets is a nice twist.

-Learning curve.  If you cook a lot, you'll learn how to use this quickly.  If you don't, chances are you're going to have a lot of overcooked food.  Note cooking times and water to avoid that.
The only mild complaint I have is that the blade does not seal as well as the larger Cuisinarts - it does make a perfect, restaraunt-quality smoothie, but I would use less than the amount suggested by the recipe book if you don't want a liquidy mess on your hands.

I opted for the Stainless Steel version, at a bit of a premium over the Aluminum Model due to some review comments about 'off' Tastes when Cooking acid foods. Who knows, we'll see.

1351	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am a tea lover...plain, with sugar and cream, iced...but I really disliked how to deal with a used tea bag.  Tea bags can be used more than once if you have made a single cup.  I have tea every morning, and a small saucer that is stacked with used tea bags.  In the afternoon, I brew a second or third cup, using those tea bags.  It is unattactive, and probably not healthy, as any fly that might be in our home, lands there several times a day.  So, my husband found this while shopping for another item, and the price was great.  I have used this several times.  It is fantastic.  I was worried it would be too hot with the used tea bag inside, but it isn't.  It acts as a hot pad.  I can squeeze out most of the brewed tea held in the bag.  The used bag dries inside the Sqeezmo, and can be used again. Great invention, simple, works, and at a small cost.

We are using them and they work fine.
I've been using this strainer regularly for a year. I am quite impressed by it. It is still in perfect shape. There is no rust nor discoloration. The wire mesh is still perfectly intact, smooth and round (unlike other strainers I've owned that are riddled with dimples). The handle has not bent one bit. The mesh has also been fine enough for all of my needs, without having to also use a cheesecloth as I did with other strainers.
9972	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this potato masher. Most of my family and friends are Scotch-Irish and needless to say get togethers usually involve a 5 pound bag of potatoes. This masher makes quick work of them without causing nearly as much arm strain as mashers with a stick type handle. The only drawbacks are you can sometimes get a bit of potato on your knuckles as others have mentioned (in my house that just means you're lucky cause you get to lick them), and you can't use it with a non-stick pan since its metal.

With this one, you have to time your cooking. We wait to close the lid only after the water is boiling. That way the pressure builds right away after closing the lid. It also allows us to time the cooking right. It's the same time regardless of the quantity if you time it from the point pressure builds.

8004	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The tool works okay enough for zesting, but is terrible at peeling for cocktails or drinks that need a twist.  The scoop cutting device on my unit was dull and it did NOT cut into the skin of the lemons, limes, or oranges.  So, half of the functionality of the device is lost. Therefore, the OXO Lemon Zester is not worth the expense.  No matter how I held the zester or oriented the fruit, it didn't cut. I was left with having to find alternatives and the OXO zester is used only for the thin strips of skin used for recipes (not for cocktails).

The exterior diameter is reduced, so it will not be as easy to grip these unless you have quite small hands.

3105	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This Presto pressure cooker works for my needs.  When I recently had to replace mine I looked at the more expensive versions but simply couldn't justify the added cost.  The one I just replaced was over 10 years old when I replaced it, if I bought one that costs 5 times as much then it would probably last at least 5 times as long - but I do I really need a pressure cooker to last 50 years?  I use it as a pressure cooker several times a month and use it as a general purpose type pot a few additional times a month.  It isn't exact regarding pressure, but let's be serious, neither is most cooking in general.  If you need to know the precise pressure for some reason, then I wouldn't recommend this one.

At least with this machine the entire coffee grinding assembly can be put under water.  I have made coffee with beans and with pre ground coffee.  Both work excellent.

However, if you use suction only for the bulk of the work, it lasts significantly longer.  I haven't tried any others yet, but this one works pretty well.  It's fantastic that there aren't wires to trip over or get tangled in.  In fact it's kinda fun to vacuum again.
2821	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  It replaces a pressure cooker that I have had over 40 years.  I found I can cook dried beans in 5 to 6 minutes of steam, and then let the steam drop on its own.  A great time saver.

843	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	There are  some people saying they didn't even get the right thing at all, while I didn't get exactly what the picture showed, it's not horrible. Instead of a quilt blanket inside mine was a pink fleece one with little elephants. I like fleece more than quilt blankets so for me it's not a problem. The blanket covers my feet and reaches up to the bottom of my chin and I'm around 5'4 so it's not a short blanket, but it's kind of narrow. People say they have trouble folding the blanket up but it's really not that difficult if you pay attention to how it was folded when you open it. The zipper is kind of a low quality plastic and it's smaller than expected too. Not bad, I like it and I would suggest this to other people.

4542	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent pressure cooker. I also have the 8-quart stainless steel model by Presto and I don't like that one as much as this one. I like the little rocker on top better because I know exactly how much pressure it has. It is super easy to carry this extremely lightweight pressure cooker to the sink, run water over it, and in 5-10 seconds the pressure is down! It is not heavy or hot. You just have to be careful when you do this. I actually prefer this method of quick cooling to the method used in the 8-quart, which is to open the little weight and let the steam shoot out the top. That method takes about a minute, plus there's steam all over the place. That seems more dangerous to me than going to the sink.

Saw this and was tickled pink.  Something I knew they didn't have.  When I received it I couldn't believe the quality of the product.  What a find.  I know they will be happy with it, thank you.
Would have rated this vacuum 5 stars except for three things  1. The vent between the wand and the hose is located exactly where you hold the wand.  The first time I used the machine, my hand twisted it in such a way that it pinched my palm.  The pain was sever enough to make me consider returning the wretched thing.  My solution was to wrap the vent in duct tape.  Now it is useless but it can't bite me again.  2.  The flimsy plastic hose and wand make it feel fragile.  3.  The cord stores in a very unhandy place.  Should store somewhere on top for easy winding.

My boss travels to different conferences and I need to ship her materials and then she ships them back when the conferences were over.

I looked into buying pricy shipping ocntainers but decided to try this first, we're so glad we did :)
5745	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	All cheap plastic, very few fibers on brush and I don't see how the floor attachment can pick up any dirt on carpet.  Only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because you get what you pay for and this was not expensive. It has a long wand, lightweight and sounds powerful.  Hopefully it will be able to reach under the bed where my other vacuum can not.  Fortunately, I have a brush attachment from my other vacuum I can use.

4590	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This little vac is a champ! I have a German Shedder mix at home and this piece of equipment has changed my life and my relationship with my fur buddy. This vac was also a champ at cleaning up sawdust and tile chips from a recent home remodel -- strong enough to pick up some dropped screws. I use this vac primarily on wood laminate and low profile rugs, I have not used it on carpet much.
That said, I do have a couple of caveats.  The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor.  It is just too small for normal tasks.  Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.  Using it in an application like this would take forever.  However, it's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient.  I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets.  Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart.

Was looking for a vac to replace ones I have had over the years made by Hoover - a small, commercial, light weight unit that I can carry over my shoulder.  While looking for the next version of that machine on Amazon, I found this one by Eureka.  It's small and light weight so I can carry on my shoulder (with a strap from the Hoover).  It has lots of power, gets under and behind things easily, cleans out in a snap and stores in almost no space.  In fact, the only thing this machine lacks that I liked on the much-more expensive Hoover is the length of the power cord.  With the Hoover I could do the whole house moving the cord once.  With this I move the plug twice.  Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with its operation.
- Fan speed dial and plug connection are on the MIDDLE OF THE BACK. This is not ideal if bringing air into the house from a window and not an attractive option when exhausting out.

The Presto brand is very common across the country so the parts are widely available. The sealing ring must be replaced on all pressure cookers  periodically no matter who the manufacturer is.

5291	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I have used this vacuum twice.  I only have hardwood floors, so it should not have been a problem.  BUT, the first time I used it the hose kinked.  The second time the suction is so low it will not pick up DUST from my hardwood floor.  I know that it loses suction with the adjustor in the hose and I made sure that was completely closed off.  The bag is practically empty still.  Completely worthless.  I would NEVER recommend this horrible product to anyone.
2496	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is my second one.  I dropped the lid and cracked the first one.  Pros - easy to use, cooks fast, durable, safe for the most part.  Cons - extremely heavy.  Not a problem unless you have chronic pain or arthritis.  Also, the rubber part will smell like whatever you cooked.  Lastly, it can be unsafe.  My first one had hot water shoot out of it like a water fall when I released the pressure.  The main way to avoid this is to not put too much liquid the pot.  Most things make their own liquid anyway, like frozen veggies.  Also, take it off the stove and lower the pressure one step at a time.  For example go from setting 2 to setting 1 then release steam.  All in all, i like it.  Its a whole lot easier to use than my instapot.

One note- if you have an older house without A/C you also likely have beautiful old wooden windows with original wavy glass.  If this is the case then it's likely this fan won't fit those windows because while the diameter of the fan itself is 20" or whatever, the casing around it won't squish down enough to fit.  I remedied this by swearing and then jamming it into the frame slight sideways and pulling the casing down over the top.

The container is a size which is easy for a person to handle, not too wide to grip the handles.  I thought about something larger but I think I'll stick with this size.  Anything larger would be cumbersome.
First, this is easy to use. Unlike a vertical masher, the OXO has an easy grip handle which is comfortable to use and requires far less "muscle".  I like the fact that I have more control over the texture of my mashed potatoes. I like basic mashed potatoes that are on the lumpy side and the control you have using this masher will produce the perfect lumps. However, when I make my holiday mashers with cream cheese I can go as creamy as I want. This also can be used on sweet potatoes, squash, pumpkin, and even cooked apples.

The bad: the construction of the unit itself needs some improvement; after two months of routine, reasonably careful use, the top of the machine broke off, due mainly to what seems to be a flimsy hinge design. Fortunately, it was still possible to affix the top to the unit during the time we waited for a replacement part.

8710	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I love this apple corer. I have bought different kinds in the past but they always seemed to break fast. This one is the best by far. Nice rubber handle so its easy to grip. Simply center it in the middle of the apple and it pushes down with ease simply removing the corer in a breeze. Haven't had no issues with any rust or it bending out of shape. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for that corer that is high quality.
I've never cooked with a pressure cooker before; this turns out to have both pluses and minuses... the main plus is the (supposed) faster cooking time.  However, this advantage is offset by the length heat-up time (which cannot be quickened) and cool-off time (which CAN be quickened by holding down the pressure valve, but I don't know if I'm harming the device by doing this every time).
excellent

2B)  Use the Genuine Eureka Bags in this vacuum, and swap out the filters routinely.  And don't forget to promptly change the bag if it's full!  If you want compactness in a vacuum, you are going to have to accept a smaller bag capacity--there's no way around that.  A larger canister-style vacuum will clean better, longer, only because its bag capacity is larger (and it will also be heavier and take up a lot more space).

Moved and didn't use it for a year, but when we did, the fan blade was stiff, got it going and a week later the motor died. The front barrings, or what ever they use, were shot.

Over the years, I'd say they average 3-6 years or more of regular use (many thousands of hours) Their mode of failure is usually shaft support failure.... they just get so they won't "go" when powered on.

My first was given to me second hand in 1970 and it has worked just fine all these years but I decided I wanted one a little bigger (my old one is a 6 qt.).

I looked at the Hoover Lynx and the Electrolux battery models which several of our neighbors have and recommended to us. FIrst, the cost of the Hoover and the Electrolux was over $100 more than this Eureka! The Electrolux models, while they had lithium batteries, had the disadvantage that the batteries were sealed into the unit and so I could not have an extra battery to use. The Hoover Lynx had the availability to insert an extra battery, but the battery costs as much as this entire Eureka with TWO batteries!

I can't seem to get the full flavor nuances on the latter when using the Pressure Cooker, however, strangely, we did gobble up everything made by it.  Cabbage in soup gets overcooked, though, as this is powerful and and has only one setting at 15 lbs.  Perhaps delicate herbs and flavoring get smothered by the extreme pressure?  Maybe not either, as I'm still experimenting in amounts and may take me a year or more to determine the truth, as I don't use fresh herbs and tend to customize my recipes on the fly.
2553	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I really wanted to like this.  It was inexpensive and cooked meat beautifully the first three times I used it.

I used the wipes and cleaned myself and I was amazed at how great it felt. That same natural "high" you get when showering and feeling clean I got with the Tender Fresh wipes. I felt refreshed and pretty good despite wearing the same clothes day after day. It was great. And the best part is that I didn't have that baby wipe smell - I actually smelled halfway decent.
- Lasko promotes this as their fan of choice to PUT IN A WINDOW because it is more RAIN RESISTANT (not weatherproof).

5379	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	If you've never tried a stick vac, I highly recommend them.  Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming.  I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all.  The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned.  Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple.  It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting.

4176	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great for camping and they double as a seat.
2959	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Not hard to put together, was excited to cook. Massive steam coming out, did not come to pressure. Looked with flashlight.. the air vent lock never moved into place because it is not aligned. Tried to tap it hoping it would... no. So I burned 20 dollars worth of chicken breasts. Now I have paid $50 bucks for the pressure cooker, $20 for chicken breasts (and onion/garlic) and have nothing but junk. Already threw out box as could not imagine would need to return. Basically, I bought an expensive pot.
If you look at my other reviews, I almost never gush.  I'm a hyper-critical son of a female dog (sorry, Mom!) and can find fault in just about anything.  But this thing is amazing.  The 6qt bucket cooks 3-5 pounds of meat in under an hour.  With the right spices, the meat is extremely flavorful, and it's always falling apart tender.  The spice combinations can be complicated, or as simple as salt and pepper - it's up to the cook.
For the price, I am ecstatic with this little guy.  It does a little more than I expected it would (pretty efficiently vacuuming the rug and the couches), works great for my quick pet hair clean up on my hard surface floors.  I have used it every day since getting it.  Would definitely recommend.
5785	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love it. Came really fast really vacuums my room n bed which has lots or pet fur. It's just noisy and kind of provide hot air at the rear but other then that's it's a vacuum and it does it's job

If you don't have an ice crusher, just put some cubes in a plastic bag and wap them a few times, instant crushed ice.  Same thing with crackers or nuts.  Anyway, it gets used, maybe not what it was meant for, but it's good to have around.
6945	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	these were for my wife here mighty mite did not have enough length. these fit perfect.
Update. Both batteries failed to hold any charge after a few months, not heavily used. And... they cost almost as much as the vacuum. Going a different direction can't recommend
We've started going to stews and lower quality cuts of meat (gotta love food-for-fuel-caused increases in prices!) for our dishes and that involves way too much time sweating.  So I finally decided to check out the pressure cooker laying fallow in the cupboard in the hopes of making my time in the kitchen both shorter and more productive.
Enjoy!

6094	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Update: After owning this and the hand-held version for some time, this corded canister vacuum outlasted and fared surprisingly well with the addition of one, big hair cat plus his cat litter. It still works the same as the first day I purchased it several years ago. As many people may know, vacuuming cat litter and cat hair is no easy feat. Not all vacs do well with cat litter (they can break down from it).
Cons:  ONLY on the 35-gallon.  This bulky storage container is extremely hard to carry.  I put a lot of weight in it, with my tent, stakes, and some cooking wear.  It holds the weight, but I have a tough time moving it, due to the exceptionally small grip inserts for the two handles. I literally can only fit the first digit of my fingers inside of the hand grips, which are only located on the far sides of the tote.  This needs re-designed with more, deeper, hand grips.  I DARE someone at Rubbermaid to try to move this through a doorway with even 50 pounds of weight inside.  The 24-gallon ActionPacker does not have this design problem.  Otherwise, these are perfect for camping.
5486	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I've gone through a few of these because I love the suction, size, and practicality...it's cordless. But the battery does not last more than maybe 1 minute. It's the 3rd one I've tossed. Too bad. I had to get one with a cord
5368	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is my second one!  The first list auction for some reason, after a year. My only problem with the vacuum is that the hose is so flimsy and kinks after a while.

7574	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These are well made and sturdy with a great grip. Use them to close bags and hold messages. The little magnet keeps them attached to any metal surface. Those other so called bag clips crack and fall apart. Not these. Must buy!
1212	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This blender sounds louder than a jet plane and when you're through holding it together, the food looks the same as when you put it in.

About 5 days later, I received the Steamvac and thought I'd try to get that stain out, that by this point was also trapping dirt. I was amazed that the Steamvac completely removed the stain! I did have to scrub the spot with the bristles on the suction head as the manual suggests doing, but I didn't have to put much muscle into it. I also used VERY hot water, which I'm sure helped.

8121	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Before purchasing this nifty little zester, I would always leave the zest out of any recipe that called for it.  Whenever I tried to use a grater, the colored zest would stick inside the holes.

1677	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	practical, healthy, useful. I love it. Will buy again soon.
This container is definitely a step above the $7 variety.  Tougher, more impact resistant and looks like it will last.  It still seems a bit high.  I am thinking about $20 would be right.  On the other hand this price is at the low end of what others charge, and then they add a big shipping charge.
The design is pretty poor.  Cord storage is about as bad as having none at all.  The power button is only convenient if you carry the thing around, which makes the wheels pointless.  The hose and telescopic extension are good lengths, though the quality of the hose is poor.  I've NEVER had a hose that was so flimsy and expect I'll have to replace/repair it in short order.  The cord is a little short for large spaces.  The main body isn't very maneuverable and falls over.  Worst of all is the opening for controlling suction power.  I've never seen anything so pathetic.  It's just a hole with a twist turn cover and even when it's completely closed you can tell there's no seal on it.  Location of it makes it easy to open unintentionally.
1225	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a high quality blender that is made to last. I have had many blenders over the past decade and this is by far the best. Whether it is smoothies, pancake batter, shakes etc....it does a great job. Highly recommended.

By the way, the nice thing about the current Presto pressure cooker is that they have an aluminum disk bonded to the bottom, for great browning. For a stew you brown the meat in this unit on the range. When the meat is browned, add a little liquid, vegetables, attach the top, and let it pressurize.  When done, the beef stew is incredible, done in one pot, and with the pressure cooker action, the inside of the pot is deglazed, the flavor is in the meat, and the cleanup is a dream.

7096	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product, but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts, including the motor, are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day, a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother, well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round, setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture.
3231	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	If there was ten stars, I'd fill all of them in! I live this! You don't need to oil it and it works beautifully! It cuts half the time of my other pressure cooker! And it was the good type! I truly love this pressure cooker! Totally worth the buy!

6/10/13 - I see they have lowered the price substantially (if I remember correctly it was around $75), but it's still relatively expensive. I bought 4 from ACE Hardware for $120 plus tax.

6194	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is the second Mighty Mite I have owned.  It's a great little machine, a bit noisy, though.  Personally, I don't like how you have to wrap the cord around the prongs on the bottom of the machine but that's only because I'm in my 80's and it's a bit awkward for me.  It's a 4 1/2 star product.
I give the carpet a deeper cleaning on the weekend with the Dyson....but this does it for me through the week.
Like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, this one is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use. Its elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to move back and forth between the kitchen and the dinner table.

If you review these, you might want to state what unit they worked with - if it's a unit that's available at Amazon. They would help potential customers. I bought these because I saw that people who bought my vacuum also bought these wands.

681	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I purchased my heaters early this year because last year when the cold snap hit they were back ordered for so long.
2361	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We've been using this pressure cooker constantly, several times every week, for 22 months and it has performed flawlessly. Being stainless steel, it also cleans easily and no part of it has rusted. We purchased a replacement gasket and emergency valve/plug to have ready for when those parts need replacing, but the original parts are holding up fine. We paid a little over $42 for this in early 2016 and consider it a terrific value. It appears to be selling for a few dollars less now. Would we buy it again? Absolutely, but it appears we may never need to. This is the perfect size (4-quart) for around 4 persons, or more, or for a couple that likes to prepare a few meals ahead of time. Very happy we purchased this pressure cooker and would recommend it to anyone.
Use is simple, with the only real consideration being the amount of water in it and the cooking time (in general, if you want it to cook longer, use more water, less if cooking for less time), the charts for which are freely available on the Internet.  It makes cooking rice, barley and meats - usually things that can take a lot of time - insanely fast.  That the results are generally more flavorful and aromatic only adds icing to the pressure-cooker cake.
2032	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	got these to replace a broken belt in our steam cleaner. instructions available online. repair took maybe a half an hour and i was able to finish steam cleaning my floors that day!


8238	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	...really, I did.  I am a loyal Oxo customer and nearly everything in my kitchen is from either the Good Grips or the SteeL product line.  I was really excited to use this on the fresh herbs I grew in my garden...but it just flat out doesn't work.  It pains me to give an Oxo product only one star, but honestly, the thing is worthless.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.  Even apart from the fact that the blades do absolutely nothing, it's also extremely difficult to re-assemble it after you take it apart to clean it.  It's really just a big disappointment on multiple levels and it's currently taking up space in my drawer.

4220	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We used it and it worked very well. The steam vent was not as noisy as some I have used. The safety catch and anti-vacuum valve worked very nice too.

848	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Arrived wayyyy quicker than expected just in time for christmas. The cover inside it is a nice clean white material and super warm, my little sister loves it! she uses the bear pillow to store other of her items
5774	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Would not recommend this vacuum.  The extension parts of the handle come apart easily.  A small "door" to open or shut (allowing control of suction power for hard floors vs. carpet) pinches my hand everytime I use the vacuum and won't stay open or closed, acc. to what I need.  Terribly noisy and just generally not user friendly.  Bought this to replace a small Dirt Devil vac that I loved and has been discontinued.  This was not a good substitute at all.
The pressure cooker intensifies the flavor and tenderizes tough meat like pork shoulder.  When I smell the aroma, then I turn off the heat, and let it sit on the stove for 1/2 hour to decrease pressure.  PUSHING the lid down with one hand, while turning the handle with the other hand helps to snap on the lid easier.  Letting gasket (rubber ring) to cool off completely, before washing it helps to prolong the life of the sealing ring.  Someone else suggested oiling the rubber ring to prolong its life.

630	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works great. Have been using it for a week. It keeps my home office warm so I don't have to heat my whole house during the day when no one else is home. It is a little low to the ground so I have it placed on top of a couple thick textbooks. You can set the temperature you want and when you turn it on, it automatically starts blowing at full blast but you can lower the fan speed (2 settings). It also has the option to rotate side to side or just remain stationary. And you can also set a timer for it to turn off anywhere from 1hr-8hrs later.  Love it!
3878	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I just received the Cooker and I am very please with the easy of assembly. In just a couple of minutes the handles were secured and in place.  Looking forward to start cooking
6364	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This was a good, cost-effective purchase of a replacement drive belt for a Windtunnel vacuum.  These belts will separate occasionally, especially when the agitator jams, and these belts are a good, easy-to-install replacement.

5314	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Works well. Somewhat cheap construction to be expected as this is an inexpensive vacuum.

Cons:
4364	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These are great little vacuums, easy to carry around and use.
One caveat:  because it is called a "two-in-one", I thought that it could be converted into a hand vacuum as well.  Not so - the "two-in-one" refers to cleaning both carpets and bare floors.  I also use the floor setting (no brush action) when vacuuming  area rugs, rugs with fringe, etc. - anything that might get tangled up in the brush.
Pros:


248	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	this and the little box of smut make a great addition to any fridge or range hood. great way to leave notes for flat mates, parents or inlaws
7643	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Gets the peeling done well
5302	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Don't believe good reviews. This vacuum was so cheaply made and ineffective we returned it on day 1. Hose instantly kinks and would surely have torn within a month. Main cleaning head constantly fell off of extension wand ( wand is only metal part) and hose fell off of wand. No attention at all paid to size tolerances. Wheels showed wear after single use. Also underpowered. Eureka is neither mighty, nor fit for use by pet lovers.
This is exactly what I needed.

We have had the first, smaller, one for almost 15 years, and it still works perfectly after being used 2 to 3 times a week every summer. The only problem is that with our large family, we run out of ice cream too fast! I found out about the 6 quart freezer and bought it for my parents as a gift. The amount of ice cream is perfect for a large family or a small party. My mother even uses it in her catering business. The motor is powerful, making the ice cream in no time!

After about 4 years it started leaking steam like crazy.  I would have ordered new parts for it, but the reviews were so horrible on customer support that I pitched it & got this Presto.  Much better quality.

2841	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	It's just the right size for one or 2 people, although I wish the aluminum was a little heavier, with a thicker bottom. It's a little bit of a challenge to get the top to sit right so you can close it down. You kind of have to watch for the top knob to start wobbling so you know when pressure is reached to know when to shut it off.  I have an electric one with a thermostat and it's too sensitive; it shuts down too soon, so I bought this one to sit on the stove top, and it doesn't think it knows best!

5694	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I owned the predecessor of this vacuum cleaner, the Eureka Poweline, for many years.  Several of the attachments were lost or needed to be replaced and I found it was less expensive to replace the entire vacuum cleaner than each of the attachments separately.

3997	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	First: I bought this to avoid getting aluminum in my food, so I was surprised that the cooking rack that came with it WAS ALUMINUM. So I called the customer service number on the box (1-800-877-0441) and explained to the CS Rep. that I bought the cooker because I didn't want aluminum in my food, but the rack was aluminum.  She stated that it came that way.  Then I asked:"So if someone buys your stainless steel cooker , you just let them 'assume' that the rack is stainless steel also?"  She said that no, they had a stainless steel rack available, but that it normally cost $8, but she would send one out to me free of charge.  I received it today.  I suggest you take care of this when you first receive the product.
3623	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Reviewed many pressure cookers before deciding on this one.  While it requires a bit of assembly (handles and valve) these are minor issues.  Very well made cooker and the 64 page booklet included useful information and recipes.  Bought the 4 quart model since use for one person most of the time.  Not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely.  Like the fact that Presto has replacement seals when needed.

4886	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Great sucking power otherwise that's all. No retractable cord so you'll need to wrap it on the bottom of the vacuum. Head doesn't click on anywhere so it'll pop of while in use or trying to store it. Awkward handle...actually there really isn't one. It's more like where the handle click onto the vacuum. Very hard to store without taking it apart. Suction isn't worth the rest of the vacuum being awkward.
3882	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have only used it once since I got it, but it worked wonderfully. I hadn't owned a pressure cooker in many, many years, and had forgotten how useful they are. My mother used them a lot when I was growing up. I bought another brand about a year ago, but it overheated and the gasket warped. I was unable to get a replacement gasket because it had to be ordered online and the shipping cost ($5) was as much as the gasket ($5). So I just replaced the cooker with a brand I know and which has a sterling reputation -- Presto. That was the brand my mother always used. I am very happy now with this reliable, and attractive, pressure cooker.

  Eminem is branching out into movies now with a loosely autobiographical "8 Mile".  Early reviews there seem positive, too.  It's always fascinating to see what he will produce next.  The controversy he generates grabs people's attention the first time.  The skill and talent that he displays keeps people returning each additional time.

6159	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We've used Mighty Mites for many years to vacuum hair in a veterinary clinic prior to wet mopping. They have good suction and hold up well. The only weakness is lack of a cord strain relief on the bottom. After extended use and flexing, the cord fails where it exits the vacuum cleaner. This requires taking the machine apart and rewiring it.

The album opens with a string of strength, starting with `White America'.  The song is targeted at, but not limited to, the political embarrassments that surrounded our country around the time the album was dropped.  With a fiery delivery that shows true passion for his themes, Eminem defies the stigma that surrounds the genre and shows that he has logical teeth behind his words (he's shown that before, but it's always nice to be reminded).  `Business' follows with a funky beat that gives Eminem a nice backdrop for his clownish lyrics.  It's not the best track on the album, and it's certainly not the best of Eminem's playful tracks, but it kind of gets everything right.  `Cleanin' Out My Closet' brings us back to a more serious place, delivering one of Eminem's best tracks to date.  Eminem takes us back to his childhood and uncovers more about his turbulent relationship with his mother.  The picture he paints is grim, yet it is lathered with pure style.  `Square Dance' jumps back to a more playful tone (yet it certainly retains a more serious edge with its lyrical content) and it does so flawlessly.  This one has always been one of my favorites on the album.  The beat is sick and the rhymes are tightly structured around the infectious beat.

Swiveling head on the BMC is also a mind blower in comparison to the Eureka. The BMC is created much like a gyroscope in that it swivels on two different axes. You are able to stand it up perfectly upright while still having the vacuum head square on the floor. The Eureka has no such flexibility only allowing a single knee operation. So how does this compute into its actual use? The BMC made it effortless to get into the tiny area alongside my bathroom sink where I park the trash can and almost always needs cleaning because of the near misses. The distance between the wall and vanity is only 9 inches, and with the installed towel rack taking up that space it is only 5 inches. I was able to drop it in and do one side of that area, and then simply drop it in again to do the other side. It got everything in there. I tried to access the same way with the Eureka but from straight down from the top it is not flexible enough to have the shoe sit squarely on the floor rendering it useless for such task. Overall the gyroscope like flexibility of the BMC both with its coplanar flexible dual plane intuitive ability makes it a breeze to use even when vacuuming the regular wide open floor. I am sure you have seen a commercial with a vacuum head swiveling and going in any direction you may want it. Well this one does exactly that. The Eureka does have a single flexible knee that has a limited range of movement. So for moving the head side by side you are more or less scraping it across the floor instead of gliding it in the direction of movement. You can see the spinning brush through the clear plastic upper area of the foot brush giving you convenient feedback if anything is stuck or jammed in the brush area. The brush does not spin until you make complete contact with the floor.

Note that for any given loudness or air velocity they overlap in, these models have very similar sound/velocity profiles.

Replaced my old eureka boss 9 amp unit.  Plus side of this newer model is the bigger bag area, and has great suction. Do not know how long the new cheap switch design will last either, uses plastic case section for leveling switch action.  Believe over time this will only get brittle and snap off ?  Hose attaching is now a dedicated design, cannot use any other standard vacuum hose with it.  Option of reversing hose to blowing outlet, maybe useful for some people.  For now, would buy again if needed.  Use for garage clean up, very loud for in house use.  The next model up for pet cleaning seems to just add a hepa filter to hang on exhaust end of vacuum from what I can tell.  Seems hepa filter units are being placed after the motor, instead of in front of it, allowing small particles to beat the motor with wear, over time!  My guess on hepa filter units.

This tool makes perfect zest that includes only the flavorful colored part of the citrus peel.  You run it lightly over the surface of the peel, and it makes ultra-thin strips of colored zest.

This potato masher is the best I have ever used, and makes the best mashed potatoes. First of all, you should always make sure your potatoes are as dry as possible. After draining the potatoes, leave them in the pan over med heat until you are sure they are dry. Then place them in a receptacle that is deep and wide enough to mash. The oversize handle is so easy to use and is great for mashing. The wide head of the masher eliminates any lumps, but if you want a few lumps leave them. Mix butter and a small amount of warm cream, salt and pepper into the potatoes, and you will have the most delicious mashed potatoes you have ever had.
This is a nice, solid, reliable cooker. Presto does a good job on the owners manual, some basic recipes, etc. The cooker has a little rack so you can keep your meat off the floor of the cooker.
You will have to clean your window screens. Kind of like replacing your furnace filters. Depending on how dusty your area is, you may have to do it more than once a year.
It can also be used for any number of other things-- you can scrape stripes in the skin to create decorative cucumber slices, for example.  The uses are only as limited as your imagination.

It is pressurized by a valve consisting of only a weight, so accidents--such as an explosion--should be impossible in reasonable use. No complaints!
2988	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works well, but you need to know how it works.  The center post with the pressure regulator AND the safety lock in the end of the handle on the lid both leak steam while it is warming up. If you put the regulator on the post, the safety valve will NOT pop up to lock the lid, it will just keep blowing steam. The trick?  Prepare the pot as normal, put it on the stove on high, wait....about 10 minutes or until both the center post AND the safety lock hole are blowing steam, then...V E R Y  C A R E F U L L Y, using tongs or another tool that keeps your fingers away from the steam, drop the pressure regulator onto the center post and the safety lock will pop up just like that.  After that you reduce the burner to the desired temp and just wait til it's done.

Second, he made the crucial decision early on to ally himself with arguably the most respected and skillful name in the hip-hop world, Dr. Dre.  With Dre's expert and ORIGINAL sound backing up Shady's vocals, it was inevitable that he would be successful and that eventually people would come around to realize his talent.
3910	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis, and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker, well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories, just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher, no fuss, no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel, putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood.

1063	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I received this as a gift almost 12 years ago, and it still works and has a permanent place on my kitchen counter. The bowls and accessories have yet to crack, break, or melt in the dishwasher, and I've never had to sharpen the blades or the shredder edges. It blends, purees, chops, shreds, and grates things with amazing speed, and everything comes out even -- no big chunks and tiny bits. My husband complains because he always locks the bowl on backwards, but it's just a matter of looking, in my opinion. The only problems I have is that it's hard to get stuff out of the inside of the pusher (because it's so deep) and that it's now too small for our family! But I wouldn't give it up... it's been too reliable and has worked fabulously over the years.
6695	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have never built anything, so I need something simple. It took me about 3 hours to finish the product, but like I said....I didn't know what I was doing. I have completed my first one, I did put cinder block under the bottom pieces to help support the weight as many said. It is 10 foot long to fit my deck area and 4 foot tall. I did use another set to put a brace on top, simply because I was not sure  if the sides would bow out, and I connected with a 2 x 4. This will also serve to hold the tarp even. I have purchased 3 more sets and am very happy with the product.

2278	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I upgraded from a 6 quart to this 8 and I love it. It has it's quirks, tho. The handle doesn't seem to want to stay tight, so with using it several times a week, I have to re-tighten the screw every few weeks. It's aluminum, so it discolors/stains easily. It is nice to finally be able to cook things and have some leftovers, tho. Between my husband and moose of a 14 yr old son, the 6 quart just couldn't make enough to make leftovers a possibility. I've never been disappointed in any of my Presto pressure cookers, from my original hand-me-down I got from my mom, to my 6 quart, to this. I love that I can start with frozen food and have a meal in less than an hour. It's a life and time saver.

2810	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking), so thought I'd try it myself.

The hose seems flimsy and cheap, but this is by design.  It serves its purpose, and is relatively inexpensive to replace.  The hose is for the most part, crush-proof, and unless you cut it, it'll last a long, long time.  Price the nicer, wire-framed hoses and you'll know what I mean--this version is far less expensive to replace!  But it is a bit stiff and unwieldy in close quarters, like on a stairway, say.

2865	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure cooker is a great starter into the art of Pressure cooking, 6-Quarts is just the right size for almost any one who cooks on a regular basis. You will use 4 Quarts (1 gallon) for cooking and the remaining space is for pressure expansion. An Aluminium insert is included that keeps the cooking items above the bottom of the pot.
Cons
The instruction book that comes with this cooker is probably one of the best I have read in recent years.  At the same time it is also very detailed in the care, maintenance and handling of the cooker.  For example, it recommends replacing the seal and the safety plug once every two years.  Of course that probably depends on the amount of use and the care you take of the product.  In any case recommends replacing the safety plug when you replace the seal.  Both are available on Amazon but this will mean a continuing cost to use the product. At the moment using Amazon Prime cost is about $15 for the pair of items or roughly $7.50 a year if replace every two years. I do highly recommend anyone wanting to use the product to read the instructions very carefully and perhaps highlight the key items.  For example what foods to cook and more important what foods not to cook.  What level in the pot to use for various items depending on their expansion during cooking.  Also you need to look through the hole for the safety plug to be sure it is clear and use pipe cleaners to clean that hole and also the hole through the nut, all explained very clearly in the instructions.  Various tips on how to clean (and how not to clean) the pot are very useful.  If you have induction stove you will need the stainless steel pot since the aluminum pots are not magnetic, but then you probably knew that.

938	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I want to preface this with saying I have not bought these yet, but I looked at them in the Ikea store at least 3 times and have found that no other utensils that I have compared them too have been as strong as these ones. I have looked at flatware sets at Walmart, Target and Costco and none of them pass the 'bending' test quite as well. When I tried to bend the fork tines on these at the store they held up way better than any other sets I have compared them too, even the other more expensive sets at Ikea! Also, I believe them to be quite durable because the cafeteria at our local Ikea actually uses the Dragon set as their flatware so you can pretty easily see how they hold up to ware and tare, which seems to be quite well! The new set is pretty shiny but the utensils in the cafeteria seem to have dulled a bit, although I am sure they go through some heavy washing pretty frequently. I would say the only thing I don't like about these is that the fork tines are not long enough to satisfy me, which is the only reason I haven't bought these yet despite my belief that they are of good quality. But that is just personal preference, so if you don't care about the length of the fork tines and just want durable flatware that will hold up well to bending or perhaps accidentally falling into the garbage disposal, then these seem to be pretty good for that.
9749	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very well made and durable strainer. Cleans up nicely. Would like the mesh to be a little tighter.

"White America" made me smile right off the bat, the "I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!" line is hilarious.  "Cleaning Out My Closet" is indeed brutal and unwincing, and the rhymes definitely testify to his skill.  I think it made me hate his mother almost as much as he does.  "Square Dance" should made anyone young paying close attention feel at least a little uneasy about being drafted.  "Without Me" is catch as heck, and seems like a fun live track as well, as shown at Eminem's performance on SNL recently.  It goes on and on.  Perhaps the only song I'm not so fond of is "Sing for the Moment," which features some not-so-great sampling which seems more appropriate for a Puff Daddy track.  Eninem's best when it's his own rhymes and beats filling up the song.
Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag, I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag. This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house.

As a result, my meals look more attractive and cooking time is more uniform. As a single person, I find the Cuisinart most useful for casseroles, stews, and for making large dishes for leftovers for the week (very helpful for busy working people like me). I even like it as a substitute for my blender, which has now been relegated to my basement storage. The Cuisinart takes up about the same counter space as the blender, and yet it is far more versatile and efficient!
2556	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I am new to pressure cooking, but not to physics. I played around with this and have managed to promote it to one of my most-often-used appliances in just a few months. Even more amazing, I demonstrated it for my mother, whose attitude went from "That thing will blow up and destroy everything" to contemplating getting one for herself. The cooker is steel, works with flat, gas, electric coil, and induction ranges, and cleans easily (I wash it by hand just after using it, so I haven't put it in the dishwasher). Just don't lose any of the pieces (if you do you can easily reorder them and they are not expensive), and check the vent either by blowing canned air through it or looking through it to see if you can see light.

- Stainless steel makes it great for browning meat pieces for stew or stock, and it heats up fast and holds heat well.
1746	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is just the right size for one person (or even two). It makes about three teacups at a time. Bodum's system for controlling the brewing of tea is the best that I've found. After you push the plunger down, no further increase in strength of the tea can occur. I've used their all glass versions of the teapot for many years. I like this one best because of its all metal construction. It is important to preheat the heavy cast iron pot with a preliminary partial filling of near boiling water. But, with all that thermal mass, the tea stays much hotter for a longer time.
7026	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	They fit my ArmorAll AA255 Utility Wet/Dry Vacuum perfectly even though they were made by Shop-Vac.

We see below that the difference in yearly electrical cost is fairly small, and of course much less than air conditioning. If a little additional on-going expense for a fan makes this much less costly alternative to air conditioning more palatable, then that's probably a good investment.
3342	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I like that it is deeper than the old (my mother's) one, but it works beautifully - just like it's supposed to! my old one couldn't build up pressure, in spite of replacing the rings.

Looking on the bright side though, I knew that Winter would be here in a few months and then things would be different.  Oh boy, as it turned out, the *things would be different* comment was a vast under-statement.
Other reviews make a good point emphasizing that it does miss some spots. I feel like it's a very minor thing though and many zester will miss pieces too, but don't get this product if you are aiming to get 100% of the zest. It's not a big deal for me personally though as I feel like it misses less than 10% so I can always get another fruit out.
Following directions EXACTLY as it says ... such as adding 1 Tablespoon of oil to prevent foaming of beans, and don't add too much water to pre-soaked beans (only barely cover).  My mistake was using too much liquid ... get watery roast & watery beans.  Cooking rice?  Not as good as regular pot, since it's a hassle to put that inside another bowl, and place the bowl inside the pressure cooker.

We have hard floors through the main part of our house, and this sweeper works great for picking up all the dirt and hair from our two large dogs.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I do need to clean it out a couple of times due to the dog hair, or else the container gets too full and it won't continue to pick up the dirt.  On one hand, it would be nice if the container was a little larger, but it is also meant to be small and light weight, so you have to take that into consideration.  For someone without dogs, this would work great.  It is also nice if you have a small mess to clean up and don't want to get out the big sweeper.

9762	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is the smoothest and nicest can opener I have ever used. So far it opens cans with an ease I have not ever experienced before. I have come to really appreciate OXO as a design company that cares about what they are making and takes pride in it. They don't always make the very best in a category but when they don't they are still very close to the mark. I would be hard pressed to guess how many OXO designed products you would find in my kitchen. I also have the "Made in USA Can Opener" which is the traditional design and of course made in US and a very heavy well crafted product, but I have to say this approach with the extra large knob is a winner and in my opinion a better improved design over other openers.

6653	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	just cut the 2x4's and you're good to go.  Using new (wet) 2x4's makes the fitting a little harder but still makes setting up a wood pile a snap.
4672	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I hate this thing. Sorry I ordered it. I've had two of the yellow ones and swear by them. They made the pipe that connects to the head metal on this--I guess it's supposed to be nice to be able to elongate it simply--but it's heavy and impossible to whip off to reach corners without the head like I did with my old yellow one. Tried using the metal pipe in a corner--it ripped my linoleum and it's heavy. Awful. The pet attachment works nicely.
5333	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for those small jobs you do not want to whip out the big vacuum. It picks up well including pet hair on carpet. Having the extra battery is super because i know I have enough juice for whatever job I am doing. The head being wide is a problem for vacuuming the car somewhat but I have figured out ways to get around that. Overall it is a very good vacuum for those small jobs.

Now when I wash the spreader, I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that), wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more, and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then you might look elsewhere.

6492	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These work exactly as described and allowed me to have two firewood racks, one inside and one out.  As other reviewers point out, if you use pressure treated lumber (recommended) you'll have to shave a little off the ends to make them fit properly.  Took only a few minutes and the racks were ready for wood.
Update:  Okay, we're now into serious cold time.  Tonight was the first night of negative temperatures, and this baby is having no problem keeping my admittedly small apartment nice and toasty.  Of course, the real test of a heater is recovery time, so for those of you with feline companions, here's the test results:
1162	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The first one sent did not work so I sent it back & immediately got a replacement....I love this...it is so handy....High;l recommend this model!!
it includes different racks as well for steaming.
use on a deeper pile carpet but excellent for wood or tile floors.
6668	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	not all wintunnel vacuums are the same. If you have model UH70120 you need to order the belt model 38528058. On the back of your vacuum,check your model # and get the correct belt.

Cons: Cheap cheap cheap plastic hose and extension tubes. Good grief they are cheap. Cheap also is the Actual floor attachment, and yes it DOES scratch my hardwood floors - will have to upgrade that. Also the electric cord is cheap and does not bend well, you have to wrap it around the bottom of the canister. I used to have a lovely little Sears Kenmore number where you just pressed a button and the entire cord automatically retracted into the unit - brilliant. Eureka was shortsighted in going cheap on these issues when the actual unit is good! Lastly if you look at the picture of the woman vacuuming a floor you can see that using both extension tubes makes it too tall for her...well...yeh....me too. So I am left with only using one of the tubes which means I have to bend down! It's either or. So I vote NO do not buy this. If Eureka listened and changed things maybe I would again buy one but make them take back the one I own now.

1180	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry), we did not have "proof of purchase" and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.

You have to be attentive when you use them, but they work great and make a great quick homecooked meal - think of it as the opposite of a slow cooker/crock pot.  I bought this one for my daughter and gave her a few "cooking lessons" with it.  No disappointments here.

 I hope that this new vacuum is as long lived as it's predecessor.
I  recommend this to all people who are looking for a good pizza wheel at a  bargain price.
Also, I was hoping I could also use them to hold pictures or little things like that up on the fridge.  They are not strong enough to do that, though, but I don't think they were intended to be anyway.  So don't expect to be able to do that.

5527	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This thing has scratched my floor so many times that I have since donated it to goodwill. The ground clearance is so low that if you have any tiny bits of dirt/rock on your floor that you didn't notice you will notice it for sure once you run the vacuum over it and see the scratch. I will say that I have kids and dogs and they track in more than the average amount of dirt.

3883	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This pressure cooker works ok, but it takes the longest time to get something cooked. My other cooker from India (Prestige) is much faster. So from an energy consumption stand point this may not be the most efficient. But the steel is hardy and doesn't burn the food. And it's no nonsense and gets the job done.
629	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I was thrilled to see this style of wine opener at such a reasonable price. Now I know why.  After about 10 uses, it started to act up. Sometimes instead of pulling the cork out out, it pushed the cork into the bottle, making a spattering of red wine stains all over my shirt. I used it a few more times and now it does that every time.  I stopped using it, forgot about it, and then a guest used it, which ended up with the cork in the bottle and red wine all over her.  Too late to send it back, so it goes in the garbage.

I had use an older version for many years before the bowl finally became warped from the dishwasher and I just couldn't get the lid on anymore. They don't really make the plastic bowl dishwasher safe, and that's kind of a bummer.

I even tried it on some carpeted stairs......omg......It weighs nothing.....now it is all I will ever use on my 1 carpeted stairs and 2 hardwood stairs!!
7352	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It works great for making P P & J sandwiches or spreading mayonnaise on bread.  I also like the cutting ability of this tool which means that for items that you don't really need a more dedicated knife for this item is great.  The handle is easy to hang onto and doesn't slip.  I use it all the time.

As an allergy and asthma sufferer who is also sensitive to smell...I really appreciate that I can use this vac and smell nothing but CLEAN.  That is HUGE.  I have had a couple other vacs that literally switching them on made me gag!  The worst offender was a cyclonic bag-less canister vac.  EW.  It always smelled like dust and dog hair, even when it was new, even when it was empty!  I am comforted by the bags and HEPA filter in this that can be CHANGED to prevent that from happening with this vac.

1246	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now, and it is still going strong.  I have been impressed by its ability to chew through large volumes of basil when making pesto, and small things like sesame seeds for making tahini.  It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.  And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.  I don't think this mini prep eliminates the usefulness of a full-size cuisinart, but it sure is much easier to clean up when you only need to process 1-2 cups of something.
1904	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Thank you for carrying this item. The vacuum is old , belonging to my mom. When she passed away. I had to bring it home because it works so well. Sadly, you are the only place I can get belts for it.

7394	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is the best peeler! It removes the skin of veggies very easily but JUST the skin, not so much that you're throwing out half of the fruit or veggie. I love it. Worth every penny!
3363	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I make soups and stews with ingredients than take regular boiling a couple hours to soften. I remembered my parents using something like it so I figured let's see. Besides, with this crazy winter's crazy heating bills (thanks polar vortex! - NOT), I can use some savings. I am so very happy I did! It comes with a starter recipe book since the cooking times/methodology is different than what traditional cooking is. You do have to assemble the handles but it's not crazy. Just one phillips screwdriver and 5 mins.
I new that my wife had paid [$$$] & that the Rabbit (at half that price) was getting good press; so I made my second mistake.

9625	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Like many of you I have used an electric mixer to make mashed potatoes, and what I ended up with was a mess of glue like potatoes. Not appealing in any way. I had an old potato masher that I used, but it broke. I look upon that occasion as a stroke of luck.
6373	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm giving these five stars because they are for the Vacuum Cleaner I purchased, UH72400, that was such a good buy. However, there has been no need to use these yet but can't imagine they would be anything but five stars as part of this Vacuum.
863	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My mom used to make homemade pickels.  You would always know where they were in the fridge from the green container.  I am so excited to be learning to make my own pickles now and happy to find the same container!  Her's is over 20 years old and still works perfectly.  I'm hoping they still make them like they used to.  So far so good! :)
4614	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Good one with clasic paper bags which i think is better then those without bags at all. I simply take it out when it is full and put it in trash. Strong and small. Just pipe could better quality

4677	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this item months ago. I was nervous at first, I heard how pressure cookers would blow up. I did some calling around to Grandma, mother & others, ask them about their experience with pressure cookers. I was given some great info and some recipes. Then I started to test it out . No problem. Love it!! It is the perfect size for 2 people meals. I have cooked my Dads canned green beans, potatoes & onions, cooked for 20 min.s , YUMMY! Great item to have to cut cooking time in half.
6179	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased many vacuums that say they are good for hardwood floors and dog hair, but this little wonder is the first that actually works!!!  It is light - I can carry it around.  The wand is long enough that I don't have to bend over to vacuum the floors.  The bag is large and lasts 5-6 cleanings.  It does not push the hair around, but actually inhales it!!!  The price is wonderfully low.  Anytime I would even look at a vacuum cleaner I would perspire, but this little gem gets the job done before I even know it.
7137	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These bags are almost impossible to find in the stores now.  They are genuine Eureka parts, so they work perfectly on my old canister vacuum.  The price was good, too- Yay!!
6377	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	good

9387	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	A large wheel, nicely angled and a good grip make this a no-effort pizza wheel. Some of the other manufacturers have lots of wobble in the wheel, making it difficult to cut straight and apply even pressure. This wheel is comfortable to use and the manufacturing tolerance is impressive for something as inexpensive as this. Highly recommended.

2290	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Bought this at the beginning of the summer to cool down my attic, It works fantastically other than the lowest speed settings it makes a annoying noise but other than that its perfect. I even made a box out of wood for it so i can use it as a regular box fan, i put it next to my bed to keep me cool at night.
2321	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The fan is big, so you will need a large window to fit it in. I have an older house, so my windows are larger and the fan fit perfectly. Really moves the air, which is what i wanted. I have had it only for two months, but it has performed admirably. Easy to setup, right out of the box.
I figured that the whole Eureka WITH the extra battery cost me $50 and I would see how it did. If it did not satisfy during the Amazon return period, it would go back. If it had the "die right after the warranty ends" syndrome, I was out $50 not $150 PLUS another $50+ for a spare battery.
1532	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful spline.  Size is right on.
They fold up to fit in the palm of your hand so I am always able to fit at least one in even a smaller purse!  They could fold up smaller if the little button straps were a little shorter to hold it together firmly.
3922	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love it.

8738	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great peeler, very sharp!
2504	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I live in a 1400 sq ft 3 bedroom condo in San Diego.  Our HOA prohibits window fans, so instead of mounting this fan in the window, I've mounted it in the access opening to the attic. This fan fits perfectly in the standard sized ceiling panel (16x22) opening leading up to the vented attic above my condo.  This fan pulls a lot of air through all of the rooms, creating a nice breeze and keeps my electric bill low by reducing my use of AC.  It is relatively quiet considering the amount of air it moves.  I'm rating this a 4 instead of a 5 because the control dial works well enough but it feels flimsy, is made of cheap plastic and comes off too easily.
I will not lie to you; I am a big fan of Oxo products.  I have very seldom ever been disappointed in any of them and as a matter of fact, they have usually been much, much better than the makers claim they are...a rare thing these days.  This server is not different.  It is an excellent product.
8431	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	High quality and durable.  I've owned this for 6 years now and there are no problems with it, including no rust anywhere.
4293	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Love this little vac!!  Was prepared for it to be loud, but it's actually quitter than our old upright.  But man, does it get the job done!!  And it's so light, when you move around the room, you can't even tell you're dragging it behind you.  Great buy!!
4009	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This product is no good. The metal that is used to manufacture this thing is of a poorer quality to the one I bought 3 years ago. The handles are soft and appear to be susceptible to breaking. I will not buy the product ever again.
5796	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	OK
420	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	My kids, ages 5 &7 love this placemat. They got it for Christmas a year ago, and since then their interest in space and our solar system has increased.

We purchased a few inexpensive remote controlled power sockets that have about a 60ft remote control range - so I'm able to turn his fan on from anywhere in the house without waking him.
2260	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Great fan for my apartment

6965	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Good extensions - Works great
7644	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I didn't expect it to grate so fine,so I still need a regular grater.
9935	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Great can opener -- smooth, easy to use, doesn't require much force. I thought switching from an electric can opener would be a step down. In comparison, though, I prefer this one -- it's lightweight, easy to clean, takes up less space, doesn't require nearby plug access.

3260	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Best one I've ever owned. Steel rather than aluminum makes a huge difference. Even has a copper valve. Fantastic quality and such a great price. The right size too. Must have for discerning cooks.
2208	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Works Amazingly!!

6684	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Since I always replace my own belts, I was happy to get these at a good price too. They work as they are supposed to and the delivery was great.
I think you'd be better off with a brand like Rosle or WMF - even though a lot of their products are now manufactured in China, at least they're 18/10 stainless, and German designed.

I know many people are afraid of using pressure cookers, but when you know the taste will be much richer,it's worth using,definitely.

1199	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I've had a Cuisinart mini-prep processor (DLC-1TX) for 15 years and it choked on the top speed this morning. I'll order another now. I've used it to chop nuts, fruits and veggies for baking into muffins, toppings, and anything else that only needs a small amount, but finely chopped!! No need for fancy blade changes, just want one to do the work!

1. The durability of the unit.
canister cleaners are horrible to clean (which includes the filters) and are hideous to take apart and put back together.

- Little smaller enclosure (you wouldn't notice unless side-by-side), though the blades pass through an area near to the highest square inches of the bunch.
Really?? It's sensationally peeling the potato skin so thin and smooth. I was so .. eye popped. I peeled two more potatoes for just peeling it off. Haha it's really amusing . Have it one

You paid extra for stainless steel over aluminum, right? Quite a bit extra. And yet Presto, in their corporate wisdom, included an aluminum disc with your stainless steel cooker, with instructions that it is to be used when cooking meats or vegetables, or any time you don't want disparate flavors to blend.
4336	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Perfect!!
5185	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Eureka mighty mite is pretty mighty for a little guy but could have a few improvement.  The power for it's size is more than enough and i'm definitely not comparing this to a dyson.  With that said, given the size, it would be nice if they have a better cord management system.  With the annoyance of dragging the house around, the cord is a bit annoying to loop & unloop from the bottom.  For whatever reason, the attachments falls off quite easily when vaccuming.  I needed this for a 8X10 area rug and this does the job just fine.  Just wished it's a little easier to use.
6754	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	When I recived my vacumn the bresh did not move after replacing the belt it works great. I could have gone to a store and bought a belt, but when gas cost $4 a gallon the belt would have cost twixe.
9611	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	The spinner lid comes apart easy to clean / dry. Bottom is lined with silicone grip so it does not slide all over the place while using.
5844	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Our previous Mighty Mite gave up the ghost after so many years I've lost count.  This replacement is quite an upgrade in terms of power and performance.  Loved the old Mighty Mite, this one is even better.
7275	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	What is to say about vacuum bags.  They work fine and fit my cleaner, the old Hoover Hornet Canister Vac, which I love.  Keep on making these bags!
8953	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I saw all the warnings about this item not being dishwasher safe. I saw the sticker on the flat side of the mallet. Good to go, as I hand wash my dishes. After having used the thing and cleaned it right after I was done, one evening when I was tired I simply I tossed it in with the few dishes and utensils soaking in hot water. Big mistake. After that, this thing was ruined. It should have been obvious. Why would something not be dishwasher safe? The high temperatures, of course. I knew not to put it in the dishwasher, but I did not want chicken juice getting crusted on the thing and so I put it in with everything else to hand wash.
