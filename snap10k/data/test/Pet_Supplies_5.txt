As far as can a Dane/Boxer mix destroy this - YES. Will only take a couple minutes if left unattended. I only pull these out of the bag of toys when we are going to use the iFetch. My big boy wears my arm out so I got the iFetch to go the distance.

6552	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	A good product. My three pugs are old and love this stuff.  My only complaint is receiving dented cans. If it continues I will have to go back to buying this from the pet store.
I only wish that when placing an order the seller would send 3 of the same design as our dogs prefer the T-Rex over the stegosaurus.  How they can tell the difference is beyond me but our lab, Shepard mix, and husky always go for the T-Rex when available.

6715	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I heard good things about this but my cat doesn't like it. I thought it would be newspaper pieces but.. It's actually hard and heavy and no very absorbent. I gave it to my  worker since she likes it. She mixes it in with her clump litter and to me, I didn't like this idea because it ended up looking like poop pieces in the litter... :-/ sorry. No go for me

The packaging is well designed too. The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel. Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them. A++ product. If you have dogs, you really should try these baggies!

Great buy
5739	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Very expensive for a lightbulb but has exceeded my expectations. I waited until it was in use for over a month before posting this review to make sure it kept working. It has. I'm using it for my front porch which has a high ceiling (about 11') with a recessed can fixture. This really fit the bill as I didn't have any other option with that kind of fixture for motion sensing operation. I live in Michigan & we've had an early cold snap which didn't affect its operation at all. My son parks in the drive & comes in from work every night & it's worked flawlessly! It's really nice because it comes on when anyone gets within about 8' of the porch then stays on for about 3 minutes as promised. Was pleasantly surprised that we don't trigger the lamp from inside the house. I've got a large transom window above the front door & two side light windows. We can walk past the door & thankfully, the light doesn't come on. All I can hope is that it's got longevity. Works great in conjunction with my Ring Video Doorbell&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ring-Wi-Fi-Enabled-Video-Doorbell/dp/B00N2ZDXW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ring Wi-Fi Enabled Video Doorbell</a>

8107	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I didn't allow my dog to keep this toy long enough for her to do any lasting damage to herself.  I should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering because, like a lot of posters have claimed, this product is certainly hard enough to break an animal's teeth. There are plenty of safer alternatives available that won't injure a pet.  Also, despite the rigidity of the toy's material, it's still possible for a power chewer to break off small pieces of plastic and ingest them, something I don't feel is desirable or healthy.
7166	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	My kitties like the Max chicken flavor better. Typically salmon is usually the first choice at our house?
1131	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	I paid way too much to find out that the motor makes a lot of noise when cleaning the box. My cat was scared of it even though the timing was set to delay the cleaning. The box takes up a lot of room and has to be plugged in so placement is limited. I also did not like that the soiled litter would stick to the bottom, break into small pieces that the comb would not catch, and often missed the receptacle. I ended up having to clean it out manually to fix the mess left behind. I would rather just scoop it the first time myself and save the hassle....and money. I gave mine to a friend and she eventually had the same complaints about the cleanliness. Her cats used it just fine without fear.
7494	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I'm glad I tried these. Thought it would too big for my 11lb baby. But it is a decent & good size. Her back teeth is still coming in.

One word of advice....I order the 5 pack of both the beef flavor and the chicken flavor.  The expiration on the 5 packs of beef is in April.  While I have until October regarding the Chicken flavor.  So make sure before ordering in bulk that you will be able to use it up before expiration date.

6697	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	My dogs liked this food, and the ingredients seems good but the quality control of the product was so bad you didn't know what would be in the can.  It has gone from a firm content to a sticky soft goo, large chunks of what I think was bones (they crumbled not hard but I wouldn't want my dogs to eat them) sometime all around the can was a gel (I called them and they said it was broth that separated from rest of the ingredients) sometimes lots of large sweet potato chunks.  The main complaint was it seldom came out of the can as a whole to cut it into equal parts and it was never the same consistency.

 Great exercise tool.
9474	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	The pan is well made and last a long time but is MUCH bigger than I expected. I thought it was the large size so make sure you measure before ordering.
  these mutt mitt bags are larger than most bags, but when it comes time to pick and scoop, you will be glad they are sturdy and handy.  some of the smaller bags online look nice in a roll and fit into a nice plastic container ready to clip onto the leash or whatever, but they are so thin that it makes scooping treacherous to say the least.  no one wants a rip or a tear in this process, that is for sure. sometimes those thin bags in the rolls necessitated a second or third bag to make the odor go away.  is that why most of those are sold in the multi pack rolls?  we take several mutt mitts with us on walks and drives and fold them up to fit into our pockets.  when it comes time for scooping, the thicker mutt mitts are a welcome product. only one is needed,  way to go mutt mitts...also, there is no smell on this brand to make things feel like a perfume factory in your car or pocket.  make sure it says unscented or you may wind up with a scented one.  these twist up quickly and the knot keeps the smell inside.  thanks for the great product...yrmv
1411	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	It fit myT3i perfectly. It was a much more secure fit than the original Canon which resulted in the loss and need for this replacement. No problems.
UPDATE: My dog does destroy toys now.  But, not this one!  It's just her little juggling toy.  She still loves it.
Why would I pay so much for poop bags, when there are cheaper versions and I could use grocery bags or newspaper bags for free?
5) all in all, it does save me a little bit of time, and it is much cleaner and smells less than a conventional litterbox.  i would recommend it if you have don't mind spending 100 bucks.  my cats seem to like it and find it amusing.
917	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Since starting this product 3 weeks ago, my extremely arthritic german shepherd/collie mutt has been able to resume her favorite pastimes of counter surfing and knocking the trashcan off the table so that she may snuffle around for snacks at her leisure. Also, the other day she jumped over a foot high fence around the garden - that has been able to keep her out because I've never seen her jump in 5 years. Both of these activities are a foot above her head and require the use of her "bad" back legs. It's been a year of trying to find a supplement her stomach can handle, with no incidences. Well, it's back to padlocks and impenetrable safe boxes. Thanks Halo for helping my pound dog be herself again.

6296	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Too many non-food particles. I have to add water & make it soupy for one of my cats. In doing so, little black flecks of varying sizes would appear in every serving. Upon close up inspection there was a consistent raised pattern in the flecks, indicating it was a manufactured product and not something naturally occurring in any of the ingredients. My personal opinion is that it is pieces from the rubber/plastic sheeting on the conveyor belts. Similar to thick shelf liner material. This was observed over several months, close to a year, of feeding to my cats. I switched to Sheba and do not find any particles of anything in that. Friskies is cheap for a reason. Quality control is not important.

3124	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	In her review of Frosty Dog, Chantal Ritz says that she doesn't think that any dog toy is "truly 'indestructable.'" I agree. There's not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt. So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it; whether it's safe; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day-to-day gnawing? With those tests in mind, the "Dynamic Duo," (a male Westie and female Scotty) give Frosty Dog four stars. They are currently trying to dismember their second. The first one lasted a year, the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose. And they would still be playing with it, except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing. By the way, I think that the "large" FD is probably the right size for all, but the very smallest, dogs. The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each, but the "large" FD suits them fine.

7785	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	Wish the little cans were bigger. The pull tab is convenient, but the remaining ridge around the edge after you pull off the top catches food. I would prefer to pull, dump, and be done. Instead I have to scrape and fiddle with the food with a spoon to get all the stuff out. Meanwhile the cat is yowling.. I liked the bigger cans, but apparently Amazon ran out of those.
  Let me preface this review by saying that I have never worked for or been associated in any way with the manufacturer or the distributor of this product. I am simply a discerning but thrifty dog owner.
1089	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also, the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading, which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro, the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory.

4651	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	One of the must haves if your dog likes to play fetch. I have the 18 and the 25M, I thought the 18 was a little too short so I got the 25. After comparing both, I would recommend sticking with the 18. I can throw the ball just as far as the 25, and the 25 seems a bit awkward to throw than the 18. 18 FTW!
the only downside so far is that it throws so fast and far sometime my dog loses track of it when thrown. also if its windy it gets blown more cause you're dealing with more air and space. lastly if you have an excited dog that's all over you it might crowd your throw just a little since you are swinging a stick you need your dog to give you enough space to swing. no big deal on all of those for me.

5602	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	It's a Chuckit but you can stuff it in a bag or even stick it in your pocket easily.  It throws perfectly far enough for my needs so it suits me fine.  The handle feels comfortable as well and your hand doesn't get dirty.  I absolutely love the throwing device.  The only bad thing I can say is the ball that comes with this is OK.  It's a ball, yes, but it hardly bounces at all.  Every tennis ball I've ever used seems to be better than this ball.  After a couple of throws I immediately got rid of this and used the rubber blue and orange ball they have which works way better with this.  Please ditch the crappy ball.  I'd like an option to have no ball at all or come with a better ball for a little more.
3663	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These are the best poop bags we have used because they have a double layer of plastic at the bottom where it counts. One of our dogs considers it his mission in life to never set a paw out the door without pooping at least a little.  As a result,  we use a huge number of bags and have tried many brands. For a while they were not available and we were so happy to be able to buy them again. Also, they are supposed to be biodegradable so we don't have to feel too guilty about all the plastic.
I have not found anything wrong with this device. It is great. It is so great that I have a feeling if I get one for the kids, they will be stuck on their electronics during long road trips. I really like this charger and I have benefited from it already.

9113	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	We got one of these (the stegosaurus) for our 2 7-month-old puppies toy collection, and let me say, they love it!  So much so that we can rarely give it to them as they (play) fight over it until WE can't stand listening to them anymore and take it away.  A great source to focus their chewing, rather than the furniture.  It's lasted 2 teething puppies for about 4 months with only minimal wear.  We had to order another to give them each their own, though, they still opt to fight for each others.
6542	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	For a while I used to have one of those flat scratching post that kept come up off the ground and banging on the floor when the cats used it. It didn't look that comfortable and I don't think they likes the noise either, so I was very happy when I found this one. Mine didn't come with the little disco ball but I used the hole to fill it with rocks so that it wouldn't wobble. Sisal is generally considered the best material but I've tried a sisal insert on my old scratching post and they didn't like it as much as cardboard, although I'll give it another shot with a better quality sisal. The cat nip doesnt work for my cats, they'll go nuts over it but they lick and droll all over the thing instead of scratching it. It works better without the catnip for them. The reason for 4 stars is because it's ugly compared to other angled posts. My pet store didn't have one of the nicer wooden ones but now that I see them on amazon I definitely plan to try it out. In concern is however that because it's open theres no place to fill it with rocks so it may wobble and not work as well after all. I thought I was safe with my new sofa with the post and their nails trimmed but I was wrong. they run around all day playing and there were still some accidental scratches that didn't show up on the last sofa because of the material. They ended up with softpaws but they still using the scratching post, I guess to try to get them off. Overall, my cats like it and it's a solid product.

9586	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Great large size that I couldn't find in the pet stores.  I recently moved my 8 year old cat's box to the basement.  He's a big boy, ragdoll weighing in at 18 lbs, and insisted on using a tiny litter box he had as a kitten.  The little box was in the bathroom, and I use flushable litter.  His tiny box issues included lots of misses, and poop in the hall when his tiny box wasn't clean.  Fast forward and thanks to Amazon, I ordered two of these large litter boxes and mats for the basement box move.  Believe it or not, I couldn't find this size in any local pet store - I have no idea why they wouldn't carry them, but they didn't.  My big boy is happier with two big boxes (one for poo and one for pee) and the mats keep the litter mess contained.  I don't remember what I paid for them, but whatever it cost, it was worth it.

5349	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	A very long, cold winter was hard on me and my lab puppy.  She wanted to run around and burn energy in the snow for hours at a time and I would freeze and get cold.  I bought this in early March and wish I had it all along.  She runs and chases the ball. I would have tired her out playing fetch much faster than I did just throwing the ball or frisbee to her in the snow.  This is so easy to use and really a natural throwing motion but it goes SO much farther with very little effort.  I can also control where it goes and avoid the trees in our yard.  The best toy!  Since we bought this one, we also bought the larger version and we think that it goes just as far using the small one as it does the large one.  The large one has a higher arch so it stays in the air longer, but it comes down about the same spot.  The large one also feels a lot less natural.  I love this little toy and my dog does too!  We took it with us to the dog park and another dog saw the toy and was so excited because they have one at home too.  We we played fetch with him too. :)
Love this formula because my dog loves it -- I give her my own cooked chicken (thighs cooked in a broth with some carrots and celery) which she's always been crazy about. I make a pot of this every week. This Wellness formula has good healthy ingredients in it, and is a change from her venison formula.  I just give her the chicken for a bit of fresh, unprocessed food, as I'll never believe that any processed food, no matter how good the formula, is sufficient nutrition for a living creature.

I see a lot of reviews about these breaking their dog's teeth, but luckily, that hasn't been a problem for us, and in fact, the vet just told me at her yearly appointment that my pup has very healthy teeth!  Just don't step on these - ouch!
If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray. Not the non-stick spray used in cooking either.
I got the cases from wellness she sent  and began to open them finding the same thing in each and every can. Only the top 1/3 was usable with still sifting thru a bone chip here and there. Then next was loaded with them enough that you could not sift thru it get enough clean food without destroying the food,  as you can see by the pictures of the can then the blow up of just a corner of the can. The last part packed full with crushed chips. I have gone through two cases  of the big cans in very short time because I can only use the tops of them. I keep hoping they would have addressed the problem before i go through the steps to change her food not knowing how she would do with one I arbitrarily pick.

The Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato is by far their favorite canned food.  It has protein content of 37% and a fat level of 23% (which is a little higher fat level than I would like but...).  I use an independant dog food advisory site when considering any dog food I buy and the Wellness canned dog food was rated a 4.5 (out of 5) stars and was highly recommended.

For pre-treating, I've used it and its removed stains like pet vomit or urine in cases where the Spotbot worked but left an area slightly darker than the rest of the carpet.  A quick spray with the Pre-Treat and everything was as good as new.  I typically have not left it on for the recommended time (12-72 hours), finding a half hour to be plenty.  However, I did have a small, tough stain that other cleaners did not remove, so I tried this and left it covered for about a day.  After a little rubbing afterward with a cloth and water, it did come out.
3193	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	We buy these for our two mini weiner dogs, who when we travel get a little bit anxious and it seems to calm them down just enough so that they are manageable. They don't mind eating them, in fact they gobble them down. It is not a magic pill and it doesnt make them behave like zombies but it takes enough of the edge off that they can at least get to sleep. I know for us whenver we have to go long distances in the car we use these without fail.
6932	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My cat loves these. When I get tired of blowing, my cat actually cried because she was not done. She chases some and then watches others with great interest. I like that I'm not blowing soapy stuff all over her.
The only real downside to this dog food is that it costs a lot.  $67 for a mere 24 pounds puts it among the most expensive dog food I have ever fed to my dogs.  But, if you have a small pooch to feed, if your dog has special health demands, or if for any other reason this food suits your dog best, it's worth the price.  This is high quality stuff.

3498	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I've been a customer for many years but they are no longer the same quality. I ordered the 200 and 400 batch in 2016 and they all had ugly advertising all over one side and they are indeed thinner. They rip easily on the side and have to throw it away. They aren't bags if they rip on the side.  I just ordered the 100s from amazon (Sept 2016) and they are still the same old quality that we love. I just bought 3 of the 100s for backup before they all turn into the cheap quality that they are producing.  I asked the company directly and they said its the same thickness but thats a complete lie. They said they all have advertising on one side.  So if you get one with advertising on one side, they are not the 5 star reviews that people have been posting in the past.  Sadly I can no longer recommend them. I would go as far as saying that they aren't even as good as the cheap kind because majority of them rip on the side and its no longer a "bag". The quality if very noticeable. If you have the ones with the tear off ones, no matter how gentle you are, they will rip all the way on the side. I don't see any other 2 ply on the market so I'm very upset. Who knew you could be upset over poop bags.  I used to give them 5 stars but now you will start seeing 1 and 2 stars popping up.
2556	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	My dog, who is normally very gentle with all her toys, managed to remove one of the monkey's arms within 15 minutes.  There is no indication on either the monkey or the arm that it was removed - no tear, no pulled stitches, no stuffing - nothing.

The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.

6829	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Friskies - owned by Purina is one of my favorite canned food diets. I have used it for about 6 years - both at home and in the shelter environment. The price is very fair for the amount of canned food that you get. I also have a friend that fed his cat this for 15 years...his cat never had any issues with the canned food and lived a very long life. Canned food is great to supplement because cats don't drink much water. Canned food has about 78% water content which is ideal for prevention of diseases or medical conditions related to a poor water intake. The canned food is easy to chew and digest for most cats and even kittens. I use this food as a treat for some cats. I would have the cat eat this canned food while I trimmed their claws so they would associate Friskies with a procedure that they had to have done every 3-4 weeks. I highly recommend this canned food brand.

7657	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Belgium Malinois (german sheppard k9 unit breed) usually destroys "tough" toys within an hour.  Our dinosaur lasted weeks and she didn't get tired of it.  Great for the toughest puppies.
I'm sorry if I find it hard to believe all those that have rated this negatively. My own experience with these over the last eight- years and four LitterMaids tells me that perhaps they overfilled them or neglected to check them. You can't have the same attitude of using a regular litter box. Many people fill their regular litter box up so they can slide for awhile without raking it. You can't do that with a LitterMaid. A half to three quarters of an inch of litter is plenty. And it is best to use litter like Arm & Hammer Multi-Cat clumping litter. We have used it without any trouble for years. Then you just pour in a little more every day or two. Follow those rules and it should work fine for at least a couple years.

One of our cats is a large Maine Coon who is into his elder years, so he has some kidney issues and can leave large amounts of liquid in the box.  I quickly learned to leave the Litter Maid on manual so that the litter has time to absorb and clump.  Twice each day, I simply flip the power switch to the ON position and watch the machine do all the work that I used to loathe.  Once the cleaning cycle is complete, I turn the power switch to off and sprinkle a layer of baking soda over the waste in the bin, then walk away.

1676	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	Like other Planet Dog toys, this ball is good, but not the best.  The knot in the rope comes undone quickly, so you will have to tie it again.  Also, if you have a constant chewer/mouther on balls (and don't just use it for fetching), the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it.  But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing.  Other than that, my dogs LOVE these balls.  They love the softness and the chewability.

I use the "disposable" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that's it.

2182	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	my siberian husky has gone through 10+ of these. he loves them but destroys them (siberian husky). in fact he destroys almost everything. the squeakers last forever though...have not had one bad squeaker and that's why the dog loves them because he can squeak them so easily.
I believe the food is manufactured in the UK.  I've only been able to get my hands on a couple of bags...which I thought were excellent in quality.  What a relief not having to spend an hour picking sunflower seeds and peanuts out of the mix!
You can tell the dog is so much more comfortable on this ramp. I attribute it to the raised rubber slats that go across and the rubber coating. It gives her something to grip her nails in to while she climbs. I also like the strong rubber feet on the underside. The ramp does not move one bit while she's on it. The other ramp I got had a chincy strap you needed to connect to the vehicle to secure it. It didn't fit anywhere on my vehicle.

3870	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These are standard dog tennis balls that can be used to replace the original chuck it ball your dog immediately destroyed. My pupper takes a "you can look but you can't touch" approach to fetch, and he makes sure to pop new tennis balls because I guess they are easier to carry around in tqwo pieces.. I have yet to find a tennis ball that can stand up to his desire to destroy in 2 seconds, buthese are great for the price! I'll be purchasing more since, well, see above.

The red one that has flaps that can be kept down for privacy and to block the cold air on the airplane floor.  If the pup wants or needs extra ventilation and visibility, the flaps can be rolled up and hooked to a ring on the handles.  It comes with a large side pocket for carrying collapsable bowls, treats and toys.  The material is of excellent quality.  When I had both carriers, the green and red,  on the floor last night my pups jumped from one to the other.  They love them both, and I do, too.

I did a lot of pricing and comparing products before settling on this one. It is important to me to give my K9 Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and Hyaluronic Acid. This is one of the ONLY products that has all 3 and it has the most of all 3 of all the products I viewed. Additionally, it is VERY reasonable priced when compared to other products with similar amounts of ingrediants. Particularly the Hylauronic Acid, this seems to be an expensive supplement.

8115	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	Not sure how to review this.  I have bought other flavors and it's just fine.  I did not realize this had beef livers and pork plasma in the ingredients.  Skipped right over it, I guess. Absolutely do not recall reading it in the ingredients list.  My one cat is allergic to beef and the other just won't eat this food.  It's my opinion a poultry product should just have poultry ingredients in it. That's why the two stars, that and because my cats just don't like it and I'm stuck with a whole case of it. Twenty-four bucks down the drain.  I can't shop at brick and mortar stores, have to order online.  It would be better to be able to just try a couple cans at a time instead of having to buy a whole case just to try it out. Try to feed them healthy foods, get punished in the pocketbook.

2855	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	We refer to this toy by name, which is "Tiny".  Our lab/shep (60 pounds) loves it.  I doubt I'd give this to a larger dog as I'd worry about a possible choke hazard, just in case. Our pup (18 months) treats all his plush toys very well and they last as he gently loves with kisses them but doesn't chew on them. He loves to run around with this one in his mouth or have us throw it for him to retrieve, squeaking it as he returns.  "Tiny" cleverly comes with an extra squeaker that you slip in through the small opening in his back. Our dog really loves this toy and although I'm pretty sure that if I'd have known just how small it was, I would not have bought it for this size of a dog, but now that he has it, I'm glad I did!

Cons: okay I'll just say it, it's pretty ugly. It also hangs weirdly and not near her collar, I'll probably try to figure out a way to attach it to her actual collar. Also it needs to be removed once monthly for her grooming and bath so I have no idea if pulling it apart every time will make it weaker or what. It sort of attaches like a really weak zip tie.
6509	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I like this litter but I don't love it. This litter absorbs pretty well but it's not really a great replacement for my breeze system.  The pellets do puff up and it doesn't really cover the urine smell that well but over all it works for now!

6366	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	This probably is pretty good dog food, but unlike the other fine canned dog food I buy, but it must be opened with a can opener.  Since I feeds my dogs in their kennel in my walk-out basement, this means I have to keep a can opener down there and struggle with my arthritic hands, to operate it.

I've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her, and still haven't found one.  For some reason though, she plays with this toy differently.  Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing.  That said, this is the first non-animal-part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes.  It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours, which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.

***Update: My wonderful golden is now 12!!! We've moved to Colorado and actually lead the most active life yet! Hiking up and down mountains. Her arthritis has progressed over the years and her hips are weak. But with the Connectin she rarely gets stiff. I do double her dose when we go camping and are hiking multiple days in a row. The real update here is I go to a new vet. She was skeptical of the Connectin and had me put my put pup on Glycoflex (a highly rated supplement) combined with Myristin. For 3 months I had my dog on all three supplements. Then I took her off the Connectin all together but kept her on the higher recommended dose of the other two. Well... within two weeks my pup was getting very sore, loosing her range of motion and having a hard time with stairs and getting on the furniture. So of course I put her back onto the Connectin. And as I expected, within a couple of weeks she regained her range of motion and lost all of her soreness. Took her off the Glycoflex and Myristin!

It floats so you can play w/ this in the pool or lake w/o fear of losing it.
One other note is to remember to wash all your bedding and vacuum everywhere (especially your furniture and under beds and furniture with open bottoms) in your house if you have a flea infestation.  Seeing a couple fleas on your animals may or may not warrant that. Also remember to empty your vacuum cleaner right away after vacuuming and dispose of the bag or contents in a bag, seal and put in a garbage can ASAP so the live fleas do not get back out and reinfest your home.

9921	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	What can I say?  It's clumping cat litter.  It does exactly what it is supposed to and the cats don't run from it howling.  This is not my favorite brand, but that just speaks to my preferences and not the quality of the litter.  If you need litter delivered, this is a good choice.
5076	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	If you have a dog that likes to chase balls, this is the only way to do it. I've seen people in parks with these for years and when I got a new puppy this was one his first purchases. Once you get the hang of it, it's shocking how far the ball will travel. I also use underhand for areas with lots of trees (though that takes a lot more practice). Highly recommended.
4035	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	My dog ate the orange felt right off of it and ripped the rubber apart after the first use.  I don't recommend this if you have a strong chewer.
7738	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	My puppy doesn't normally like chewing on such hard toys like these, but he seems to enjoy these more than the white nylabone bones. He isn't a huge fan of it because he can't eat it and it does make a sound, but he still chews it now and then. I don't know how much it's helping his teeth but I can only hope it is.
But when the package of kitten food showed up, it was trashed. Kibble everywhere inside the box, kibble falling out the gaps in the tape, and when I looked back, a trail of kibble following me from the front door to the kitchen. The kitten was thrilled with the trail of food, of course, but I was not. Probably half the bag had emptied in transit. It looked like the glue on the bag had come unsealed, possibly from being knocked around by a package of canned food in the too-big box it was shipped in. I left packaging feedback, which I hope they'll take to heart, because if the kitten kibble keeps falling out in transit, my kitten might eat me instead.
If you decide to buy this auto-box save the receipt.  You will need it
If you have a well-behaved dog who always walks at your left, right by your side or slightly behind you, this will probably be a favorite new thingy for you. It is adjustable both in the girth of the belt and the length of the leash. It snaps on and off quickly. It has an extra loop for tucking away the loose leash when not in use. It even has an extra snap juncture so that you can leave the slightly more difficult to clasp latch on the dog (useful only if you have a larger dog that won't have the clasp dragging the ground when not attached to the leash). You couldn't really ask for more -- other than a shorter span that allows the leash to move around the belt so that it remains on only on one side and gives the dog a gentle reminder tug that he is going out of limit when he tries to go to the other side.
4202	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Just what I needed for the ChuckIt! Fit perfectly, heavy duty, dogs loved them!
5555	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My wife's shoulder tires out before our dogs are tired from chasing their ball, so I bought her this thrower for when its her time to take the dogs out. For being the small chuckit thrower it easily throws out to 100yds. Very good investment
7631	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Kitty loves it.

I never experienced such a pain as having to make that decision, however I also was not prepared for how Wendy (16 yr old) would take it. Now I have to add that these 2 just tolerated each other they were NOT BEST FRIENDS. She went from eating everything and anything until Levi moved on. NOTHING ...NADA...she lost over 2 lbs in 2 wks I went thru Nutro and many others for months... in the trash. Then I went back to Nutro, she ate it... I ordered this awesome deal and she devoured it. Thank goodness.  Her fur is super soft/shinny and after almost 8 mos she is finally adjusting to being the only cat
If you love your cat and want to do right by them, (as well as avoid vet bills later down the line) then spend a little more money and buy a quality canned cat food like PetGuard or Organic PetGuard, or Newmans, etc.

5546	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is a variation of the prehistoric spear thrower for balls, allowing you to throw your dog's ball farther.

Your dog will love you even more.

2387	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I've ordered three of these, now, but it is not due to the quality - or lack thereof - of the product.  This lambchop stood up to more abuse from my lab mix puppy than just about any other stuffed toy.  The first one had its adorable little face ripped off and an ear pulled off (retrieved before swallowing, of course) after a couple weeks of abuse.  When it looked like lamby was going to the big dog food factory in the sky, soon, I ordered a second one.  For a short while, my pup had two lambies and was in crazy-pup heaven.  Then she finally got a seam on the first lambie open so it had to go away.  The third lamby is a gift for my in-laws' dog, so second lamby is still surviving (barely, but hey) my girl's daily abuse.  She's rough on her toys - because she loves them so much - but each generation of this one has survived weeks longer than any other stuffed toys, so far.
the good news is that the cats took to it right away--one of them with no urging at all (in fact, while i was still setting it up), and the other when the old box got dirty enough. the bad news is that i'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute. the big boxes--which are easy to scoop, even if that's no fun--are much easier for me. and for now they're in closets or otherwise out of the way, rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.
I really should put a video of this on you tube.


372	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	I don't see where these collars work
My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.

4788	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This set is very good. Its very easy to throw it very far. Its easy to throw long distance. I love that I didn't get my hands dirty with slobber. The ball released easily. I almost threw it over the fence when I first threw it because it was so easy to throw. The ball is pretty bouncy but not too bouncy. The tennis ball is destroyed pretty easily by my dog who is a pitbull. I really like that the stick is interchangeable with other large balls.  I like that the stick is longer which makes it easier to pick up and throw the ball without reaching or bending more. Disclosure I paid for this at full price.
This Advantage works much better than other products I have tried.
3938	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Regular tennis balls are not good for your pups teeth so this is the healthier alternative! I have two larger dogs and they love these balls!
8747	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This is smaller than I thought it would be, but, my dog has had hours of enjoyment out of it chewing and chewing quite happily. It doesn't hold up as well as some of the other Nylabone toys we've had in the past and the little nubbly bits come off fairly easily, It's done what it was supposed to do and that is entertain the dog though.

However, what good is kitty litter that has particles SOOO large as to be unable to sift through the openings in the litter scoop?!  Also, unless there was a significant amount of time from pee to cleaning the pan, the particles of litter never clumped at all.  I really wanted to like this litter, and I think the situation may be salvageable.  This would be a very acceptable product if the particle size was 1/2 to 1/3 the present size.

We have three of the wretched creatures: Amanda, Sissy, and Rags. They're finicky eaters, and, moreover, their individual preferences are out of sync. A fair amount of left over wet, i.e. canned, food goes down the garbage disposal. (Dry food is generally less problematic from the standpoint of acceptance, but that's another story for another time. If Amanda fills an empty stomach on dry, she often throws it up. Last week, it was on the window sill and into the groove into which the open, vertically sliding window would come to rest when closed.)

1084	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I've had LitterMaids since they first came out, and had the very first LitterMaid privacy (and litter containing) tent. That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric. So I bought a new one. What an enormous mistake. The new ones do not fit the frame in any way, shape or form. I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight, and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they can't be zippered together!!! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front, got the zipper started - and the zipper separated. Okay, put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin. The metal slider itself started to come apart. What a horrible piece of unmitigated JUNK. Don't waste your money unless LitterMaid announces a major redesign of their litter tents. It's sad, the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly. Someone, somewhere, cut a few too many corners on this product. The hole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash.

If you're reading this (and why would you....  at the time that I'm writing this review there are already over 1500 good reviews of chuckits so I am probably silly for even writing one) it is no doubt because your dog it as ball obsessed as mine is and you are either tired of picking up slobbered and muddy tennis balls or you don't feel that you throw far enough to properly exercise your pup.  Take my advice and don't buy the Sport 18M.  They say this handle is new and ergonomically improved.  It is the least comfortable of all my chuckit handles.  Get the pro 18M or the junior 18M.  The handles are much more comfortable.  This one isn't terrible but to my mind it isn't chuckits best work.  I am giving 5 stars because the chuckit reviews all get lumped on the same listing no matter the size and I would give the chuckit concept 10 stars if I could.

Also, when you have two cats jockeying to use the Littermaid at the same time, well I just had to get another to keep everyone happy!  As other users state, do not overfill the pan.  Also, line the plastic litter hoppers with grocery store bags and you can reuse, reuse, reuse, reuse them many, many times.  When the plastic litter hoppers crack, I reinforce them with clear packing tape and further extend the use of each one.  My cats all love their Littermaid Megas and we couldn't do without them.

When I opened the bag, I was happy with what I saw. These treats look great (they look like little pieces of bacon) for the dog, heck, even for a human, ha ha. Of course when he heard the bag, my dog came running. My dog doesn't really drool at all, but after having him do a few tricks for me, he actually had a drop of saliva drop on my hand as he was waiting ever so patiently. In fact, he actually wanted it so bad that he stole a second treat from me before I could get him to do anything else.
** UPDATE ** After 6 months, the paws and ears have been chewed off, but overall still a useable toy.  I got a second dog in September, and the two dogs tug on this and love it still.

5572	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My 3 year old Springer is a tennis ball nut!  There's nothing she loves more than her tennis balls except maybe chasing them - practice for catching the squirrels on our property!  This Chuckit is easy to use and once you get the hang of it you can pitch a ball a long distance saving on elbows and shoulders.  Any tennis ball will work in the head of the device.  The best way to lob a ball a goodly distance is to NOT insert the ball all the way into the head.  Place the ball about half way in, just enough so it doesn't fall out, take a standing or sitting position, and swing your arm up from a ground pointing position to just head level and let fly!  Pretend you are a kid again and swing your arm like a windmill.  Just stop the motion when your arm is pointing straight towards the heavens.  The ball will launch at least 50-80 feet in an arch.  Great invention and I love it and my dog loves it.  In all fairness to anyone who isn't finding it easy to use, well, neither has my husband been overly successful at using it either but then he's not very coordinated, LOL!  Such a simple device and I only wish I had thought of it.  Buy it and your dog will love you forever and you won't suffer any more shoulder pain pitching those balls for that slobbering ball of fur you own.  Enjoy!

And finally, while I was traveling one weekend, the rakes got permanently stuck and stripped the plastic gears. I managed to repair the thing once - (I'm a mechanical engineer so it was easy taking the thing apart and repairing it, but it wasn't exactly a hygienic task!) - by removing the gears and reshaping the plastic teeth. It lasted another couple months like this, but since the plastic teeth were already shot, when the gears started slipping a second time, I just tossed the thing (metal gears would have prevented this problem or even LitterMaid selling replacement plastic gears would help).

6118	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	AFter much  shopping, we are glad we decided on this ramp.  Our 3 elderly dogs have no problem using it, even in the rain, because of the textured rubbery surface that gives them great traction and doesn't scratch their paws. It is somewhat heavier than some other ramps, but well worth the weight. We put this up over our RV steps for the dogs, but it is strong enough for us to use also. It fits, at an angle, but still sturdy in the open back passenger door of our GMC 2500 truck.  Also, there is nothing to scratch the vehicle as all surfaces are protected with the "rubbery" coating.  We couldn't be more pleased.

For the one or two cans that were not dented, but still the food did not look right, I let her try those and she soon after went to the vet sick.  Hard to believe there were so many reviewers who said they had to force their dogs to eat it. I went out and bought better food at the store for mine, and threw out the box of dented cans, considering it a lesson learned. I get repeated requests from Amazon for review of their boxes and packaging condition - however, what does it matter how well a product is packaged if the items placed in the box are already damaged.  These cans were so obviously dented in so many places, that there was no way not to notice it at the time of packing.  Moreover, the food was disgusting, even in the undented cans.  If I could have had it tested, I'm sure it wasn't fit to eat. Sorry that she ate the little bit that she did.  This would have no stars if that were possible.

7518	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Cats still like this food with the new formulation- but I had to persist in giving it to them despite the turned up noses initially and the walks away in disgust- One trick I found to work,  if they turned their nose up at the new food, was to move their food bowl somewhere strange and that befuddled their tiny kitty brains and they were more likely to sample the new food and give it a fair shake. I fed my boy cat the new food on his cat tree, or in the middle of living room a few times. I'd follow him sauntering away and just drop the bowl down. "how about now?".. he finally relented and ate. I have to say the change to the new formulation was fortuitous for me as I was trying to get them off Wellness due to the carrageenan. One of my cats had been throwing up a few mornings a week after eating the old formula. Wellness has finally removed the carrageenan!  She hasn't thrown up since starting this new formula, fingers crossed.

But when he hits the sound button inside it and Mr Bill goes "Oh nooooooooooo," it really freaks him out. Every time that goes off, he cries and runs away for a second.

102	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I like laundry bags, these are nice quality it appears.  The zipper has a "lock" so it won't open in your washer.  It's nice to have more so you can put less in each back and use a couple.  That way your clothes get cleaner in my opinion.  The thing I don't like so much is that the biggest size is gigantic and you get 4 (of each size).  I don't really need 4 gigantic bags, the medium and small size are perfect although smaller is more needed than medium.  Another thing is that the mesh is really fine, that is nice for bras with hooks or other things with small buttons but it feels very stiff and inflexible which is also a draw back for getting your stuff clean.  Maybe they get softer with use.
The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.
It fits perfectly like the original and now I sometime forget that this one is a replacement.

He still plays with it, even though it can fit entirely in his mouth... I have bought the "small" frog and he was unable to destroy it for about 4-5 weeks (which is the longest lasting toy to date).  Now that he is fully grown, I have purchased the "Medium" Teddy Bear, and he still plays with it roughly.  They are great since you can give it to them without a squeaker so he doesn't try as hard to destroy it in hopes of obtaining the squeaker!  It is hard finding dog toys that are soft and don't have squeakers! Judging by the size of this toy, I wouldn't think it should be given to a dog over 25-30 pounds.

This toy is also well made, sturdy and I think will last a while. I think it's for smaller dogs though, big ones would tear this up very easy. I am sure my little one will with a little time, but as long as he enjoys himself, and there is no chance of him getting hurt, I don't mind. Just have to watch for when they get to the squeaker's so they  don't choke on them. But we have to keep an eye on our dog / dogs always anyways.

4847	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	A couple of years ago, I adopted a bullmastiff puppy from a local shelter, expecting her adorable-but-exhausting boisterousness to mellow out into relative couch potato-dom once she grew up. Instead, she turned out to be a mastiff-boxer mix who has, if anything, grown more energetic and will probably always be bouncing around at warp speed, breaking my stuff with her zest for life. I take her to the baseball diamond at the local park to run off some steam. But despite this daily practice, I still hadn't turned into Josh Reddick and was regularly embarrassing myself in front of the dog, who got pretty bored fetching a ball that had flown thirty feet before sputtering into the dirt. Enter the Chuckit. She now shoots gleefully around the diamond and the outfield, jowls and spit flying everywhere, chasing this bright orange miracle until she gets so tired she refuses to bring it back. And then she goes home and she sleeps. All. Day. It's beautiful.

3605	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have been buying these for at least 10 years and I cannot believe that Petco or Petsmart doesn't carry them.  I like the thickness and shape of these bags and that they are biodegradable.  Would not even think about trying another bag!
3068	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this to use with my 10 month old 75lb. Weim.  My dog is a puller and I have tried numerous leashes/harnesses to make walking her easier with varying degrees of success.  I found that she gets most excited when we're on a  trail and that's when she pulls hardest.  Even with the retractable leash, she'll take off running so fast and hard that it would snap and yank my arm almost clean out of its socket.  I figured it was easy for her to wreak havoc on my arms because they're not the strongest, but she'd have a terrible time pulling against the trunk of my body.  The first time I used this while out on a trail with her and she took off running, the belt part snapped against my sides and she was actually able to pull me up and down hills.  Still, it's better that she pulls against my full body versus my one arm.  This leash system seems pretty durable and does make walking her on trails easier, but if you get this, especially for a larger dog, you MUST also get the Lunge Buster.  This leash, while good, is kind of short, and I like to give my dog a little more distance.  The Lunge Buster doesn't stop her from snapping the leash and pulling me around, but it does take a little of the whiplash out.  Walking her hands-free is also pretty nifty, but it does get a little hard at times to reign her in when another person is walking toward us.  I have to wrap the leash around my hand a few times to shorten it and is not the ideal way I'd pull her closer to me.  The purple color is nice and bold, just like any other purple leash/collar  and goes well with her silver coat.
There are several key benefits of the Chuck It launchers: One is that you can chuck the ball further than you can throw, which allows you to exercise your dog more easily. The second is that you can pick up and launch the ball without touching it, which means NO slime! And, the Chuck It also gives extra reach when you have to retrieve a ball from sticker brambles.
THEY LOVE THIS FOOD!

Our puppy has really enjoyed it, and while it ripped across the top within a few weeks it may be just because she has puppy teeth.

With the cost and her love for this little lamb, I didn't mind to buy her a new one to prevent the insides from being all over the house.

Now - this bone is not good for all dogs. My girl is young with very healthy teeth. She's a three-year-old Heeler mix on a special diet, and we brush her teeth daily. So, her mouth is in MUCH better shape than most. As a result, she can handle these bones without a problem. But if you have an older dog, a dog with weak teeth or gingivitis, or a dog with a history of infections/illnesses/complications, this bone is not a good choice and will lead to broken/chipped teeth and mouth infections. For those dogs, I would recommend buying CET Enzymatic Chews instead.
LitterMaid was a great product when it first came out.  Unfortunately, Applica has cut corners until it is a barely usable item.  When this new one breaks, as I'm pretty much guaranteed it will, within the year, we'll save up and go to PetSmart and buy the competitor's version of the LitterMaid, which I heard is halfway decent.

6508	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I bought Yesterdays News because my local SPCA recommended a non clumping cat litter for kittens just incase it accidentally ingested some. The problem I quickly discovered is with the cat urine, it flows to the bottom of the litter pan eventually and will ferment producing a foul amonia smell. There is not a way to rid the litter box of the litter that has been urinated on. The only thing to do would be to dump the litter frequently and start fresh each time roughly every 3-5 days?
As I said, this is my second waist leash.  I suppose the first was a little better quality--thicker and double-ply.  But there's nothing wrong with this product.  The price is right and you'll wonder what you ever did without it.

2576	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	We got this because we thought it was funny -- we remember Mr. Bill.  Our dog took to it right away.  She is easy on toys so she has had it since Christmas.
4132	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Good sturdy product which will increase your throwing distance. My dog loves it.
4092	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Saves ur body for repeatedly throwing chuckit balls.  Our dogs pretty muxh demand we use it daily - sometimes twice daily.

Eventually I ended up building my own custom ramp, only because the ridges on this ramp were too deep for my dog.  If they had a slightly longer model with the same non-slip surface and shallower ridges, I would buy another in a heartbeat!
4513	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Fun
4783	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Love this chuck it is great for larger dogs that could easily choke on a regular tennis ball.  I also purchased the Ultra balls that do not have the fuzzy coating like the tennis balls.  Ultra chuck it balls are slick on the outside and work great with this thrower.  Just about any 3" ball can be used as a replacement.  I have to have 2 - 3 balls when playing with my German Shepherd.
6791	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog loves this. It actually keeps him satisfied longer and seems to be easier on his stomach. He has heart-worms and is on medication twice a day.
Our cat, who is very finicky, loves the food and is tolerating it very well. Hopefully with the higher nutrition he will put back on some of the weight he has lost and be feeling better soon.
and he seems to like it and doing well on it so i decided to buy a bigger one! My cat eats it so im happy
2343	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My Jack Russell got this toy as a tiny puppy nearly one year ago.  Since Jake loves her so much, she has taken quite a chewing in that year.  She has had surgery so many times that she now has no face, one hind leg, and no hind feet.  But, he still squeaks the 3 remaining squeakers and runs with her all through the house every day!!  So what am I doing now for his birthday???  Buying another lamb!!!  I think he'll love it just as much.  Oh yes, I have washed it several times with no problems.  I love this lamb as much as Jake.  Another note:  My mother moved in with us and was used to seeing the lamb.  When I showed her this picture of the lamb, she exclaimed, "Oh, it was so cute!  I never knew it had a face!!"  Time for another lamb!

7736	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These chew toys do an exceptional job of keeping my dogs occupied while keeping their teeth absolutely clean!  I'm almost ready for another order or larger chews, if they're available.
I wouldn't buy this again for my dog as she's particular about kibble size but if your dog doesn't have that preference then this might be a great food for them. No unpleasant smell and it seemed fresh to me.
9177	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Our cats are fussy. In fact there is one flavor of Fancy Feast they like, and that stuff goes rock hard when left in the air, so one wonders just how good it is for the fur babies. They love every flavor of the Max Cat (Nutro) wet foot in chunks with gravy and will even eat some raw food when mushed up with this. I don't know what they put in this but it's like cat crack, so I'm going to keep on buying it.

1891	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Dog loves it!
We thought that perhaps his dog food might be another culprit.  I was drawn to the fact that this was a grain free dog food and figured "what the heck."  He seems to like it just fine and although he still itches, I can report that it's not as bad as it used to be...he no longer itches to the point of breaking skin.  Whether this is directly attributable to the dog food or not, I can't say with 100% certainty, but I won't be returning to the regular dog food anytime soon as long as this keeps up.
8136	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My Koi LOVE the Vibrance food! I have to give them the Spring/Fall kind once I start feeding them in the Spring, which they will eat, but once I can finally switch over to the Vibrance, they act like different fish - way more excited about their meals. As a matter of fact, I'm praying they make it through the winter because I overfed them a lot last year and they were FAT at the end of the season. I couldn't help it! They would get so happy-acting that I hated to stop tossing the stuff in the water!
After writing to Wellness and the changes stated to us by their customer service rep Barbara as follows:

Other products, including name brands, actually contributed to giving him ear infections as well. Have used this product for the last three years and have no problems when I stick to this. Cost a couple of dollars more but it is a whole lot cheaper than a trip to the vet.
7193	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	4 cats refused to eat this!! even the stray we feed didn't want it but finally ate it. I don't know how the reviews could have been so positive on this product?  They like creamy foods but even after adding some water and making it less sticky they just would walk away from it. Darnedest thing. Just wasted a whole lot of money. Going back to Fussie Cat.

2710	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I, or really should say, my dog absolutely loves these little Bear toys and because she's so small (toy) herself, they are just the right size.  I only wish she couldn't chew (tear) them up so fast!!

5317	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Dog loves it. I like it because my lab has to run further to catch ball and it tires him out quicker
Oh well! Even if I didn't have a dog, I'd probably still like this for the novelty factor :)

This is a nice looking ball, that is no different than a much cheaper tennis ball.  A tennis ball, will actually last longer.
9842	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have 2 golden retrievers.  One doesn't really play with toys.  For the other, this is his favorite style of Kong - and he has several.  I had to replace the old one after an unfortunate run-in with the lawn mower.  He was actually smiling at me when I pulled this out of the shipping box.  I was the best dog-mom ever in that moment!
153	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Great design and great price !
I don't know how much of an endorsement this is, but this is the food that turned him from the cute little fluffy sausage link in the first picture into the lean 65lb behemoth who takes up 3/4 of the bed.
Litter falls between the box and the litter receptacle.
7704	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	They have changed the recipe on this and it no longer contains the Sweet Potatoes, Squash, Zucchini, or Blueberries. My cat won't eat it now. It's the only thing I could ever get her to eat. They also added a fish oil which ruins the smell and flavor even more. It used to have a pleasant aroma and now it just smells like cheap canned cat food. Thanks Wellness.
While the details of what inspired such a profound "statement" were not completely clear, the message was extremely clear.  And so it sits, unused and unloved, spurned by our cats.  And to the list of peculiarities our cats have displayed, we must add the term "Luddites".

4012	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I'm giving this 4 stars because they ship it with a cheesy ball. They do this so you are 'forced' to buy the Ultra balls separately. Crafty devils they are!
2591	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I got this for the dog that rescued us, knowing that he is excellent at unstuffing everything he can carry.  But, "Mr. Bill" has always meant something in this household, so I got it.  Many, many, many weeks later, I have only had to put a couple of stitches in Mr. Bill's armpits.  We still hear "Oh Nooooo. . ." during the night when Judah picks him up and puts him back where he belongs.  This many be the best made toy we have ever bought.  So, I bought more.

3105	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have had other hands free leashes and I really like this one. The problem was I meant to order the belt and leash and I accidentally got this.  However, I had a belt from another same brand product which was exactly the same so, voila, it worked after all and I ended up with two connectors for both my dogs.
Your cats will approve.
And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.

6769	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is by far the best rabbit-safe litter I've found! My cat loves it too. When it get wet it forms a big blob of mush, so it's easy to scoop it out of the box. It's softer than other paper litters, and the pellets are much smaller, so it's much more comfortable for the critters to walk on and a scoop covers the bottom of the litter pan more effectively. It doesn't really smell like anything (the other brands I've tried smell like wet ink) My rabbit doesn't love to dig in it (so my apartment stays MUCH cleaner!) and it doesn't get tracked across the carpet. If you're looking for a paper litter, this is definitely a great one to use!

As long as you have good clumping litter, it works beautifully.  The only drawbacks are that it can be a little messy disposing of the waste and the litter goes around the unit, but it is easy to clean.
7116	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My two dogs love any flavor of Wellness canned food. I feel great about feeding them Wellness since I know they make the best dog food. My dogs deserve the best and Wellness provides it!
3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.
4055	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I have the Chuck it and it's the best investment I have made for my Black Lab. I will continue to buy these balls religiously as I have found normal tennis balls are more expensive and less heavy duty than these fetch specific balls. The size is perfect and they last a decent amount of time. I did knock down to four stars because it would be ideal if they were a bit more heavy duty for my 120 lb lab.

When I opened the bag, I was happy with what I saw. These treats look great (they look like little pieces of bacon) for the dog, heck, even for a human, ha ha. Of course when he heard the bag, my dog came running. My dog doesn't really drool at all, but after having him do a few tricks for me, he actually had a drop of saliva drop on my hand as he was waiting ever so patiently. In fact, he actually wanted it so bad that he stole a second treat from me before I could get him to do anything else.

It's a shame because it's a cute toy and I hoped the raised parts would fight tartar. But I'm not willing to have her bleed and ingest plastic pieces. I generally love Nylabone bones...just stay away from this particular toy! Not safe! Imagine those little pointy pieces brushing against your gum, and you can imagine why my dog's gums were bleeding!
8075	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	My 3 cats HATE this food!  Tried a lot of brands (and they have loved them), but this one I put down and they still look at me as if to say: "Will you PLEASE put down something edible?"  Not even one bite eaten - tried 12 cans in 12 days.  Threw the rest out.  Should note that all 3 of my cats were feral rescues and are pigs when it comes to wet food - EXCEPT this brand.
Until we used this product.

2628	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My Jack Russell Terrier puppy loves this toy. He has tried his best to "kill" it, to no avail. Dr. Noy's toys are almost indestructable. I like the fact that there are no pieces to break lose or come off this toy which could be dangerous to a puppy who likes to put everything into his mouth.
4929	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for the lazy dog owner.  I sit in a comfy lawn chair and the dog gets loads of exercise.  Can't argue with that!  This is a pretty classic toy, and I"m happy to report that it seems as well made as ever.  Nothing complicated, but effective and easy to use.

1517	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	According to the dogs who gobbled this down, it tastes mighty good.  I am happy that it is also good for them.  The price seems a little high.  You have to decide if your dog is worth it.

3225	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I bought these and counted them -- had 76 in my package, so that's probably a pretty good ballpark count and a very good price -- quite a bit cheaper than the tablets in the 8 oz. package.  These chewable tabs seem to have about the same ingredients as the tablets (Ingredient lists are written up differently and a little hard to compare) and my 6-yr old dogs love them.  They  each (12 & 14 lb.) get one in the morning before our walk and two each if we're expecting  rain, thunder, a car trip, or a house full of guests.  Our male seems to calm down within 30-40 minutes; our female doesn't seem to be affected as much.  But we were having trouble with male lunging at the female and growling every time she tried to get close to me.  He even would growl and run at my husband if he got in bed after I did.  So along with the Pet-Ease we started a rigorous removal and scolding any time he growled -- he seems to be getting the idea that we won't tolerate this nasty behavior -- nonetheless, we think the Pet-Ease has had some good effects.

920	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	dogs loved these.
It is not a very sturdy toy, but because of the sound it makes, and because of its design, it actually manages to last longer than any so-called "indestructible" toy we have ever tried, and make our dog happy for a very long time. The only toys that last longer are a miraculous spider (still squeaks a bit after a few years, though he's long since chewed most of the legs off) and the "bubble wrap" style of squeak toys that are made out of a mat with 6-12 squeakers sewn into different parts of the mat. It also sounds less obnoxious to humans than most squeak toys.
9910	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This has been a huge hit at my house!  I have a multi-cat home and foster kitties through the local shelter, and this thing seems to draw them all in.  They love tapping and chasing the ball around the loop and use the cardboard scratcher in the middle.  Im glad you can turn over and replace the center scratcher because my cats will wear it out!  It doesnt seem to leave a huge mess like other cardboard scratchers Ive used.  Very happy with both the entertainment value and functionality this offers my kitties.
7415	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	When the label changed, so did the ingredients- for the worse. My cat will no longer eat this, & he used to love the turkey formula. Also, the new formula kind of sponges up (hard to describe) if it sits a short period of time. It looks like the cheap grocery store brands. Thumbs way down for the new formula.

9276	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	Second time buying these. My dog loves them. Only complaint is that their seems to be quite a few crumbs at the bottom. ...but still worth the price!
860	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	A good, healthy dry dog food.  I like Nutro's products and feel good about feeding them to our dog, their treats are also good.  Our dog is fussy, but he likes anything Nutro I've given him so far.  I recommend it.
5294	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I love this smaller size chuckit because I can carry it with me on my walks to the dog park.  It fits in my bag, unlike the longer ones.  While perhaps it can't throw as far as the longer ones, I find that it is plenty far for an urban dog park.
453	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have a 55lb dog with a very thick coat. We live in FL. We adopted her from our local shelter. She loves to lay in the grass. Unfortunately there are fleas in the grass. I bathed her with the Dawn vinegar and water mixture but that was just a temporary fix. This collar actually works!  This is our second collar. Very happy with the product.
At first I thought this damn dog toy is going to be really annoying. Yes, the "Oh Noooooooooooooooo!" Recording is a bit grating if you hear it a bunch of times. However, it seemed my dog stopped caring about the noise after a while, so I rarely hear it anymore. If you have a dog who loves it, god help your soul. I was just lucky I guess. I'd buy this again if I ever have to and I will explain why, I have two border collies who destroy every toy with rapid precision. I've bought all kinds of "indestructible" toys. If you have a shredder you know I'm talking about the ones rated on some arbitrary scale of 8 to 10 on toughness, and they are all ripped up in a day or less. I've spent $17 a pop on these toys and an hour later I'm picking up fuzz. This Mr. Bill, I don't know if they just are not interested in ripping it up, but it's lasted 6 months so far. He drags it around outside, I've thrown it the washing machine and dryer countless times, ( it still plays the Oh No! ) and it has held up.
2147	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	dogs favorite toy. the lambchop  is his favorite, and has not been ripped open! great.
Conclusion: If you like to fetch, this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther, and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are "old" they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch.
1591	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dogs love these biscuits. Can't get enough of them. Keeps their breath nice n teeth cleaner than even my brushing them. Great buy.

3621	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These are great bags.  They don't rip and when you pick up the poop and close the bag you can't smell it.  Also, since the bottom of the bag is black you don't have to look at it either.  But the best is that is is very simple to open the bag.  I can't tell you hot often I struggled to open some of those other bags.
2261	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Cute toy and well loved by my dogs and grand dogs, all of whom have rec'd one or 2 over the years. Won't withstand tug of war battles but likes to snuggle. The  "oh no" can get kind of annoying when the pups get rambunctious with it. That's when Mr. Bill gets relegated to the top of the refrigerator to take a nap.
5920	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	I bought 2 of these for my cats, and they worked fine for a while. It's a smart design, but they've got many flaws.

It also allows me to throw the ball a lot further than I normally can.
5549	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dogs love this and so do I, it is so much better than picking up a ball soaked in dog saliva.  It was a really good purchase.
5673	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	Really like it so far. Got a brand new Subaru Forester and wanted to keep the dog hair off the backseat. So far works great.
I've used SD for many years, for many cats while doing rescue, unless a cat has a special need and something else is called for. I had one cat live to be 26. I have happy, healthy cats. I like that this does not have too much protein, and we don't seem to have too many kidney and renal issues on it. They can only metabolize so much, as they are domesticated.

True to fat & lazy cat form, she lays on her side while batting at the ball until she can't reach it, but I suppose that counts as playing. She makes good use out of the cardboard scratch circle which has reduced her making use of the couch for claw sharpening despite having a scratch post. We ordered the laser light ball to replace the white plastic one that comes with it and she doesn't seem to care either way, but the laser light ball looks hecka cooler.

Instead of a flea bath he put this poison on my cat.  The very next day my cat began refusing to eat or drink anything, and would just lay on the floor and not move.  I called the vet who said the flea medication couldn't POSSIBLY harm him because "it's FDA-approved" (what a load of B.S.!!!).  Anyway, this continued for nearly a week until my cat became nothing but skin & bones and was suffering terribly.  We finally accepted the fact that it wasn't going to get better & had to take it in to be put down.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Bayer killed my cat with this poison!!!

For example, I put a Seattle Rain Guard and the seed tray on a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Droll-Yankees-CJM13GP-13in-Green-New-Generation-Metal-Peanut-Feeder/dp/B000K8C58C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Droll Yankees CJM13GP 13in Green New Generation Metal Peanut Feeder</a>.  I received a reasonable amount of traffic from nuthatches, and hairy & downy woodpeckers.  The seed tray also made it very easy for squirrels to jump 6 feet through the air and land on the peanut feeder.  As soon as I removed the seed tray and the Seattle Rain Guard, squirrel raiding stopped and I immediately started getting lots of traffic from larger woodpeckers like flickers and red-bellied woodpeckers.  I do lose a little bit of pecking waste (maybe 10%??) without the seed tray in place, but it's a small price to pay to keep squirrels off the feeder.

The nonslip textured grip on this ramp is superior to the sand paper style of other ramps. That is a plus.  However, the material was not made to last.  It claims it holds up to 500 pounds.  I weigh 120 lbs and the ramp broke when put a foot on to step up.  I am glad it was me and not my dog who fell.

As other reviewers have noted, it works OK, but not perfect.  Help is needed at times, but it's still a big benefit to have.  The rakes need to be cleaned periodically, since the clumps are not fully dried after 10 minutes.  And the litter needs to be redistributed away from the collection box several times each week as a result of the rakes getting filled with wet clumps.

Most toys require some supervision and this is true of the Wiggly Giggly as well.  If a toy has a squeak, most dogs will do all they can to "kill" the squeak and you don't want them swallowing it.

It keeps my dog close without having to worry about stepping on or having him to far away. It's also a little springy in case he gets too far ahead, it doesn't choke him.

6144	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This Petstep HalfSTEP Pet Ramp is just what we needed for our 5 month old Shih Tzu.  Poor thing is so short and close to the ground that she can not jump high enough to sit on the sofa or see anything other than ankles and feet. With her new ramp, she is able to get up in bed, bound up the deck steps and set and romp on the sofa.  She took right to the whole ramp concept and is a master at flying up and down it.  We like that it is durable and light enough to put just anywhere for her.  Great product for short puppies and dogs who want to get to a higher level.

I docked one star because I received a recall notice after buying, which is always a little frightening. Thankfully, it didn't include the dates of the cans I bought. Still, it's one of the better deals for grain-free wet food.
the disposable trays are very handy. they're stiff plastic. line them with a small garbage bag, or wash them out and reuse them. throwing them out every time is an expensive proposition.

2613	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	We are on, I believe, our fourth or fifth one of these.  You may assume by that they they are not indestructible, and you would be correct.  However, in every violent "casualty," another dog has been the 'killer.'  My dog LOVES these things and treats them like they are her baby.  She carries them to bed, she licks and licks them.  The licking was the "cause of death" for at least one of them; I have another around that's still intact but looking rather haggard from being so well loved (so we have a new one as a 'spare').  She LOVES the FIVE squeakers, and it's a great soft, squishy size.  (FYI, my dog is a 7-year-old 70lb Golden Retriever female; she's typically somewhat gentle on stuffies, although she's certainly destroyed her fair share, too).  For MYYYY dog (and I know this doesn't work with all dogs), if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it, she tends to not destroy it (or, at least, not as quickly).  I'm not sure if it's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it's to be 'babied."  I guess I'm playing into her maternal instinct.  This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all, so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog.
1188	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I bought the LM900 at a yard sale 7 years ago for $5!- I've learned a few tricks over the years to get the most out my bargain. This is not a totally maintenance free box - you have to treat it nicely! We have three large Wegies - OMG! Do you know how big the badders are on those babies? Clumps the size of boulders, I tell you! I use scoopaway litter, though it does sometimes get stuck in the corners.  To prevent sticking, I use a light coating of heavy duty silicone spray on the bottom of the (clean)box, rake and track.  Voila, problem solved!  Also, you may have seen the ads for the cart (Litterwo***)to put your littermaid onto.  Being the bargain conscious Mom that I am, I did not spend the $100+ for that cat waste marvel. I put my littermaid on a small(kid)table in the laundry room.  I cut the bottom out of a receptacle and used duct tape to firm up the sides of the receptacle. Next, I used a heavy duty shopping bag (UnderArmor- perfect fit) and folded the top over the receptacle lip. Secure bag to receptacle with duct tape. Cut the bottom of the bag open. Use another thin piece of duct tape across the edge of the box to hold the receptacle in place (only to the edge, not flapped over into the box).  Slide the box so that your new chute hangs off the end and run it into a small trash can lined with a quality Target shopping bag - (Walmart bags rip). All the clumps automatically go into your now huge receptacle, easily emptied by a small child! (Smart thinkin' huh?) Just give it a looksie every couple of days and add more litter, sending aforementioned small child in to replace Target bags. Bonus- you no longer have to buy $12 a box receptacles! For now we're planning eldercare for this box - do I hold the record for longest owned box? When it dies we will replace it with the same model - whatever the price.

This one is definitely chewable without being destroyed and I love that you can take out the squeaker because those can be obnoxious. It only has stuffing in the head which fits in my dogs mouth.  She loves this like it is her baby and doesn't want to shred it for some reason.  Probably because it's pretty darn cute too.  I'm going to have to wash it soon.  Hope it holds up.

Another thing I like is this runs very cool even when all ports are populated. That is not the case with many high speed chargers that I have owned or tested.
My kitties love this product. The texture is great - not too runny, not too pasty. I keep it in the fridge after I opened it. I find it more appetizing for the cats when I heat it in the microwave for 8-10 seconds before I feed them. I guess the heat brings out the irresistible smell.

8982	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I can't imagine a dog that chews so softly as to not destroy this thing immediately. It's really flimsy, tearable material. I could probably rip a piece off with my hands if I really tried. My small/medium dog had ripped/chewed off a chunk the first day and the little nubs were everywhere within minutes, including caught under her tongue, in her mouth, throat etc, causing her to gag and cough until she spit them out.

3048	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I recently got a new puppy and although he's learning quickly, at times it's exhausting to try to follow him all around the house to make sure he's not getting into trouble. My favorite way to use it is when you are doing something and you don't have your full attention on them, instead of putting them in a crate, you can keep them with you. I brought my puppy to a family gathering and used it to keep him with me and it made bringing him to visit so much easier. He's with me at all times and my hands are free and he can meet people, but isn't free to run and jump up on people. He quickly learned to settle and sit near me but was happy to be out and about and gives them the chance to socialize.

He can tell where the ball will go and he is so fast that this saves my arm so much pain after a round of fetch with our wolf (husky/german shepherd mix). Such a great item.

Then the vet said the cat did have fleas, and prescribed Advantage. It seems to work initially. But I am concerned about the fact that it doesnt seem to be effective for the entire month. The instructions say not to use it more than once a week. Does this mean I should use it every 2 or 3 weeks? I also wonder about the alternative packaging, with the cats sitting upright, with more purple or orange on the front of the package; is this newer packaging? which could possibly mean the the packaging shown here is old product.

I figured since Amazon's return policy is a bit of a pain, I would stick with it and see. Well, about 8 months of using it, it started developing problems; it would turn halfway, then backtrack, then turn to the intended slot. Now, 10 months in, it completely ping-pongs back and forth--and it won't stop; I have to turn it off midway and then turn it back on so it will turn to the correct food slot. I figured no problem, I'm still under the 1-year warranty--wrong! I checked the manual and they only offer a 90-day warranty. What?! Had they offered a 1-year warranty AND I was out of that 1-year warranty, I would've bought another one as a replacement.

I can throw pretty good distances which would be impossible without the Chuckit.  I love it!!!
My husband is better with the long one.  I find it harder to get the ball to release in time so it doesn't go as far for me as with the mini.  I know its just a learning curve and I need to learn to flick my wrist back slightly to release it at the best time, but I'll confess I haven't taken the time to practice this.  Also, the large one, having so much longer a handle tends to flex when I try to pick up the ball so its actually harder to do this.  I would like to try the in-between size to see if I can throw the ball further than with the mini but still pick the ball up easily.

With the High Protein Grain Free Lamb dry food they've apparently managed to hit the high mark as far as my dog is concerned. I've been buying Nutro for years, but this food gets gobbled up quickly.

Occasionally she gets a little sore after a long off-leash hike, but the soreness disappears within 24 hours, and that's on her normal dose of 1 pill daily.  If I double her dose for a few days I can literally do anything with her experiencing no visible soreness.  I couldn't be happier with this product.

**UPDATE**  September 13th, 2008:  Last week, I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog's face, exposing the irresistible stuffing inside.  Curses!  If I had sewing skills, I'd take upholstery thread (tough stuff!) and sew it back up.  But, I don't have sewing skills.  Double curses!  I'm searching for a new toy.  *sigh*  Still, the Frosty Dog lasted over 4 months, that's not too bad.

This is perfect!  It is made extremely well and is very sturdy.  It is not too heavy for me to use extensively, setting it up and taking it down.  It does not flex like the cheaper ones, and the dogs are not skittish with it.  True, it is easy to catch your fingers as you fold it, but that is typical of any fold-up device.  We have used this very often since our purchase in July 2013.  We took this on our 4,000 mile summer trip and kept it in our rooftop carrier.

The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself.  Needless to say, that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.

If I had to complain wish there were more color options- wish there were more note areas- wish it was a cooler format, like wider. Anyway, love it!

This size might be overkill because you can really send the ball flying but with a little practice it works great and gives you plenty of options.

2548	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	My 9 year old Lab loves his Mr Bill and we get a tickle out of hearing the OH NOOOOO! We remember Mr Bill (telling our age here) and this was a great reminder.  We have an 8-month old shepherd mix that is scared of the Mr Bill (which thrills the Lab as he can torment the puppy). I bought the puppy the Lambchop and he torments us all with the squeaker but he is happy. These toys have lasted longer with my dogs than any other toys I have bought. Things like a loofa toy don't last 10 minutes and even the stuffingless toys are torns to shreds in short order.  I have had these two over a month now and only had to do minor repair. Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs, only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing (like the face). I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy, "mommy" will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear. He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss. I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball.) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China. I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item. My vet says you need to be careful - particularly of the dye on toys made in China - and Mr Bill is heavily dyed. Though my dogs have had no ill effects from the toys they have to date I may give it more time before reordering.

9473	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is a good size! Mine came as a darker blue than pictured. No complaints, just an observation.
The one that does work is FANTASTIC. Line the receptacle with plastic bags and you don't have to waste them. Some of the poops mold over because they stay moist not being in litter, so i sprinkle some kitty box powder in the bottom to help with that. I have two large cats and with two boxes i only have to dump the receptacles about once or twice a week. Don't expect perfection, it doesn't look like a just filled box, it does leave a little behind, but it's certainly better than having to do all the scooping myself, and even if it leaves the occasional lumps behind, it's MUCH cleaner than it'd have been without scooping several times a day! one side of the receptacle sometimes fills up first if the cats favor a side of the box, which means you just have to dump it sooner, and if they pee right by the deposit box and pile the litter up there it doesn't scoop well, but it's not a consistant problem and having to occasionally "help the box" is much better than having to do it all yourself.

Bayer makes this product which is very effective for immediately kills adult fleas (as opposed to othe products that only kill the eggs).  However, it appears that Bayer has, and continues, to spend a lot of time and resources to make sure that no one any where sells this product below a certain price they want which I've documented going up every month and is rapidly approaching $10 a month per treatment (per cat).  I have 5 rescued cats so the price adds up to $50 per month to treat them for fleas.  Every source I could find that sold this product at bargin prices has been forced to cease selling it.  This use to be called price fixing.  Nevertheless, the product works very well.  As soon as I can find another product that will kill adult fleas for less money than the outrageous price of Bayer's Advantage, I will switch.  My order arrived very fast and was well packaged.  I will use this merchant again.  The 5 star rating is for the retail merchant, Amazon and the effectiveness of the product.

We have relied on this Purina product since forever it seems and continue to feed it to felines daily.  Older cats like the softness of the Pate on their older teeth.  The variety is good for their bodies as it  conditions different organs and bones.
CONS:  There are 4 screws with paired up wing nuts to help clamp the vertical bars with the horizontal loops.  The plastic couplers that hold the bars allow some sliding, and so it appears these screws should help secure things.  Two problems:  #1  The screws have no slots in them to turn them (see photo).  For a moment I thought perhaps these were tiny carriage bolts and they might have square edges that would be held in place, but no such luck.  The instructions say you'll need a Phillips screwdriver, but that won't work with these!  #2 The position of the brackets that the screws go into won't let the wing nut turn!  Both of these are bad indicators of quality control and poor design.

5064	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I'd give this five stars if the "mini" which was suppose to be 20.5 inches long had arrived. Instead we received the 14s which is 14 inches long.  The package says 14s but the Amazon stocking label on it says "mini".  We returned the first one and reordered the mini but got the same thing again so Amazon must have a whole bin of 14s launchers labelled as "mini" so we just decided to keep it.  The advantage of the mini is that for taller people, you don't have to lean over so far to scoop the ball up when your dog returns it to you (husband has back issues so the extra few inches in length would have been nice).  We'll wait a few months before ordering again to see if we actually can get the mini through Amazon.

8	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	If you want your bird to interact with you, then interact with your bird. Parrots have the mental capacity of a 3-5 year old child. This is like plopping your child down in front of the TV and calling it quality time. Parrots learn to communicate dynamically not by rote. I have 5 parrots and all are chatty because we chat, while cleaning, cooking, doing laundry.. whatever. Turn off the TV and read aloud, talk, sing, dance.. be one of the flock.
As another reviewer pointed out, this product does not work on ink. My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen, and this spray was not very effective on that area.

My only complaint is LitterMaid's quality control can be a little inconsistent.  Over the years I've had defective units right out of the box a little more often than I'd like.  I don't think it's unique to LitterMaid, I've seen similar QC problems with just about anything made in China.  If LitterMaid has a choice, they really should reconsider where they're doing business.  It's at the point that if I have a choice between products either made in China or elsewhere, I choose the product NOT made in China just because I've been burned too many times by shoddy workmanship, even from supposedly name brand products.

7481	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	3/2/2014 Updated Review - I've purchased this food both from Amazon and PetSmart and my puppies always loved it.  It was a thick consistency with bits of carrots.  Now, the food has changed to a repulsive mess with black flakes of something that looks like fish scales.  They hate it and I think it is disgusting.  I first received this nasty mess in every can in 3 out of the 4 cases I just received from Amazon.  I went to PetSmart to buy more hoping it would be the original consistency and once again, I have a case of nasty food.  I placed another order from Amazon hoping to get the good food they love but if I don't, it will be returned.  There is clearly something very wrong with these cans of food.  It is so different from what they've eaten since they were six weeks old, now 8 months old and there is no other explanation other than Wellness has changed the recipe.  I've inquired with Wellness to find out what is going on.  I plan to switch foods and have purchased canned Blue puppy and hope they will eat it even though it is a sudden change from the food they've always loved.

9431	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Makes my girl happy!
5104	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	Great toy and really helps to get that ball much further. I have 20lb terrier mix and at first she didn't get why I had a big stick lol but now she is use to it and enjoys it. I like it cause I don't have to wear out my arm tossing the ball for her. The only complaint I have is that there were some jagged edges on the "scoop' part. It was only on one side and can easily be grinded down so its not really a huge issue just appeared the cut was not very clean. Overall a nice sturdy and useful toy. We look forward to purchasing some more Chuck It balls soon. Also for the price man what a steal!!
7683	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have had my dogs on Wellness dog food for around two years now.  By far it is one of the best canned dog foods out there. All of my dogs do really well on the dog food.  It is all natural.  I purchase wellness products and probably would not switch to anything else.  I purchased a case of the canned dog food, normally I purchase by the can, but decided to purchase by the case.  If you are looking for all natural Wellness is the way to go.  It is also good for dogs with allergies.  No garbage in this food.  Highly recommend the product.  Well worth every penny.

7699	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	What can I say?  I believe Nutro Max to be a nutritious cat food and Lola and Springsteen picked the flavor.  Its the only one they'll eat every day; any other flavor they won't eat consistently, but Turkey and Chicken Liver they'll eat every day, twice a day.  And they need cat food with texture - the smooth stuff they won't eat.  So it's a big dewclaws up!

292	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this product!  We have a newly adopted Plott Hound and she is a bit intimidating to some.  She has a big bark and unique coloring and has some anxiety while approaching other dogs.  With this harness people have been much more accommodating in their reactions to her behavior as we work with her in public since the harness makes the message clear that she is in the midst of a learning process.  It has also deterred people from barreling right up to pet her without asking which has made it much easier on us as owners to be able to introduce her to people slowly.  I don't clip a leash to this harness so I can't attest to it's performance in that area, but my dog has been able to wear this for 5-mile walks with no chafing or overheating.  Solid purchase!

When I adopted a new cat recently, I set up a seperate little box until she could be accustomed to my house and other pets.  It was the low-tech variety needing to be scooped on a regular basis.  Once again the Super Scoop made the clumps easy to remove and the cat box itself was nearly odorless.

I decided that I'd like to get the Mega-sized unit so that my cat had more space. I read here how so many people were having problems with the units and I worried the company 'improved' the models to the point of not working. I went to a store anyway, and bought the Mega -- against the store person's recommendation.  He actually said - "I guess I do sell a few more than I get back".  But I foolishly bought it anyway, at $180 no less (trying to support the locals, you know).  It was bad.  The rake could only end up scooping half the length of the pan before it would bog down and stop and try again, unsuccessfully.  I had filled the litter up to the fill line as I have always done.  But it turns out that it can only handle scooping when the litter volume is at the minimum fill line or less.  Not practical.  And even then it would often bog down.  The motor just isn't right for the size.

First, the ingredients.  I knocked off a half star because they said "no grains" but I felt like that was a little misleading... it still has chickpeas, split peas, alfalfa meal and potatoes in it.  So yes, it doesn't have wheat or corn... but it's still veggies/filler material.  The good news, however, is that lamb and chicken meal are the first two ingredients; so the bulk of what you are getting IS not grains.  And I do think chickpeas are better than corn and soy!  It has a large list of vitamins including Omega 6 and yeast; and also has a few herbs: rosemary, green tea and spearmint.  Overall I think the quality of the ingredients is pretty darn good!

The opening is not very big so the litter box doesn't come in and out of the tent easily when I'm emptying the receptacle.

I actually have trouble finding good quality open-air litter boxes anymore at pet supply stores.

If hellcat has to stay in her carrier unsupervised for any length of time, I use twist ties to secure the zippers - just in case.

3131	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly "indestructible" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-) In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.
652	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These work perfectly with my Nerf Rival guns. I got two bags so we could use them in our little office at work.

My second Littermaid was defective; the motor stopped working for no reason after only a few days of use.  I got a replacement from Amazon, but its motor died after a few weeks.

The tennis ball it comes with has a great bounce, I don't plan on letting my dog keep the ball when we aren't using the launcher, I'm sure he would shred it quickly!

He carries it around from room to room as I move through the house and it has still taken him weeks to gnaw off even the top of the head. Not as large as I had expected but he still seems to chew out the side of his mouth so it is not an issue.  It is heavier than other brands we have purchased and is holding up well with a fairly aggressive chewer. We paid more money for the one laying in the living room floor that he won't touch.

Like I said, we've swapped out brands constantly. With three full time family members and a consistent pack of foster pups, trying to strike a balance between price and what the dogs like is rough.  They say you get what you pay for, but you can pay twice this much for some of the stuff at the vets office and yah, supposedly it's best for your dogs but it's hard to tell.  So over time, we started trying mixing the expensive stuff with the cheaper stuff. We've tried going to all moist food before. We've tried using canned food only (much much too expensive).  All this experimenting caused some problems - after the dogs started getting the canned dog food mixed in with the dry food, they got to be picky eaters. So picky that they would turn their noses up when we didn't mix in canned dog food.  After not giving them canned food mixed with the dry for a few days, they'd get used to it and start eating the dry normally. However we got the first bag from Vines for free.  It just so happened that we ran out of canned dog food two days after this arrived and we gave them the really expensive **** mountain food we had.  They would turn up their noses and only come back when they were really hungry. On day 3 of that, we ran out and just used this.  They immediately scarfed it all down (no exaggeration).  We actually had a small problem with two of them trying to eat the other's food they liked it so much.  We held off buying canned food b/c it seemed this would suffice. And sure enough, they were just as enthusiastic about it each day.  After a week when we ran out, we had yet to reorder the Nutro so moved back to the **** mountain and unless it was mixed with canned food, they had the same 'meh' response to it.  The new bag arrived, we swapped it out and viola', no more picky eaters.

2823	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I bought two of these for my dogs Christmas stockings but when I opened the box and saw them I knew "Santa Claws" was going to have to go shopping again before Christmas because these toys were not going to last for a 51lb Carolina Dog and a 60lb Lab. Besides being a little smaller than I expected they were not the Kong toys I thought they were I guess I didn't read the description well enough. This toy has a stuffing-less body with stuffing and squeaker in the head. In less than 10 minutes my labrador had ripped the head open and removed the squeaker that is enclosed in a material pocket. This toy has Velcro in the back that makes it possible for you to remove the squeaker and replace it once it's no longer squeaking but since the bear has been decapitated I won't be needing to replace the squeaker. These toys would be good for a dog in the 20 pound and under range I would say and definitely not for an aggressive or determined chewer. Kong makes a toy that looks like a stuffed animal and has a Kong inside the body as well as a smaller one inside the head. My dogs have been unable to destroy this one and that's what I was looking for when I bought the bear.

5835	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have an aging border collie that started limping about a month ago. We took him into the vet and had an X-ray done, nothing that they could find other than minimal arthritis. The vet said it wouldn't help to give him a supplement because the damage was already done, but for $12 a bag it was worth a shot. I bought two 4 pound bags from my local tractor supply store and have been giving him 2 a day since we started. I have seen a 100% turn around and rarely see him limp anymore, if any at all. His muscles are starting to come back and overall he seems a lot happier. I am hooked and bought the smaller bones for my schnauzer too. He's only a puppy, but it's good to start now! They're both picky eaters and jump for joy when they hear the bag crinkle.
3604	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I love these Mutt Mitts and have been ordering them for years.  They are double walled and seem much sturdier than other dog waste bags.

5455	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog loves to play ball, but my shoulder would start to give out after 10 hard throws and I can only throw so far; until I came across this ball launcher. I can easily throw a ball a good 100plus feet with no real effort and it doesn't kill my shoulder within 10minutes. I barely feel any stress in my arm at all by using this launcher. It's very strong plastic and will last for years to come if you take care of it. It holds all the 2.5inch Chuckit! Balls and normal Tennis balls. I love this launcher, it's so much more fun playing with my ball addicted dog. The best thing about this is that I can easily pick up the ball with this launcher without having to touch slobbery balls anymore! If you have any questions about this product, feel free to ask. I will get back to you.
This knife is well balanced, has a good cimeter curve, stays sharp, is easy to sharpen, and has the lifetime warranty from Kershaw. I live in Portland, OR, and free sharpening from Kershaw is the reason why many of my cooking knives and my pocket knives are Kershaw, KAI, or Shun. The blade guard that comes with it is great too and fits the curve perfectly.

Once out of the box, it didn't take long for them to start trying to steal it away from each other. Mr. Bill only says "Oh NOOOOOOOOOO", but that's okay. It's kind of funny when the fish does its "Oy vey" and then Mr. Bill goes "Oh NOOOOOOOO". We do take these away when it's bedtime or else we'd be awakened whenever one of the dogs rolled over onto the toy. These toys are quite well made and easily make it through several trips in the washing machine. None have started to lose any stuffing or have any sound problems and our three dogs put these toys through some pretty rough play.

This is a great alternative, it really does weaken the fleas, I used it for 3 months straight and most of the fleas on my cats are gone. It didn't completely eradicate them, but combined with Capstar this is a safer program that does not harm kitties or people. It did not make my cats sick at all and the hardest part is getting them still long enough to squeeze the tube in their mouths. They would not touch their food when this was mixed in to it. My cats are pretty smart and figured out something was up so I did waste one tube but that's ok, live and learn.

Set up was a little difficult, kind of like setting up IKEA furniture, but once it was it was set up it was very sturdy. It came completely disassembled, which is perfectly fine, just expect spending at least a half hour on setting it up. Okay for the test.... Driving 2 hours with 2 large dogs, how did it hold up? Well considering I have 1 dog that's over 150 pounds (Alaskan Malamute) I feel like it held up pretty well. We had to pull over twice, Once on the freeway and once on the side streets to fix it, but considering we don't feel like that was bad. Where we set it up in our Honda Element, it was against the doors and were couldn't get it as tight as we wanted it.
  Price fluctuates a lots, it can be .42c to high .60c a can so you have to keep an eye on it every shipment time, I have the auto ship and save for this.

I had even brought one ramp home, and then returned it because it was poorly designed and constructed.  It was the same price as the PetStep.  The PetStep model has a rubberized texture on the ramp, which is fantastic.  All other models I found had a gritty sandpaper for traction.  This was hard on human hands when manuevering the ramp, as well as the pads on the dogs' feet.  The dogs are not the delicate type (3 of them, each 100+ lbs).  The ramp is very sturdy which helps the dogs feel secure when using the ramp.  No wavy wobbling even for our hefty pups!  And... Amazon's order processing is great.  The ramp was delivered very quickly.

3399	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	In December of '09 i brought in a lovable stray kitten. I took him to the vet, got him healthy and everything was great. The only problem is that i didn't think about the fleas. all was good for a while and he only scratched himself now and again, so i didn't really think there was a flea problem. But when spring came around my entire house got infested with hundreds of fleas. My poor little chihuahua was covered in hundreds of them, and my cat was full of bites and scabs. I bathed both of them, tried several other flea treatments including collars, sprays and dips, and nothing worked. Those darn fleas kept coming back and multiplying faster than ever. So after my dog lost most of her hair from flea allergies, my cat would scratch non-stop, and i was covered in little red bumps, i decided to try out advantage which had really good reviews. I bought Advantage for cats, and one for dogs. Within an hour of applying this stuff on the animals, i saw about 25 fleas on the bed barely moving or dead. and within a week those hundreds and hundreds of fleas just died. at last my pets and i had some peace. I am truly grateful for Advantage. The doses on the dog had to be repeated every week or so because she had the most fleas, but it did the job wonderfully. I would highly recommend buying this product, especially from Amazon since the same stuff can cost you $60-$80 at a pet store.

Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.

If my husband and I kiss or hug he always grabs his Mr Bill and squeezes it to say OH NO !!! It's the funniest thing. Sadly though, the last 2 we've opened for him have been duds. No talking. He still loves his bud Bill but gets upset when he won't talk. I will continue to order and hope that whoever fills orders does check to make sure they works
I had one dear sweet elderly princess that would, at times, stand in the box with her back-end over the storage container. Until she passed away we just didn't use the lid. The Littermaid even kept her from peeing on the floor. God bless her. Before the Littermaid, she was notorious for not wanting to use a box anyone else had used. We happy she at least approved of the Littermaid's cleanliness. :-)
Thank goodness I finally made the switch to pate! Now the cats are actually EATING their wet food instead of lapping up gravy and ignoring about 30% of their food. Even my two picky eater boys eat this, and a fair bit! Which is good because they're on the thin side and could use the weight gain. :)
8926	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My cat loves this food, and ever since I switched her over to Wellness canned a few years ago, she shed the couple of pounds the vet recommended, and her coat has become so soft and shiny. She also has a very sensitive stomach, and this food is very easy on her. I alternate the flavors between Chicken, Turkey, and Chicken/herring; she's allergic to Salmon, unfortunately. The only flavor her stomach can't handle is Beef, which is puzzling, but she seems fine with the other flavors. She is 16 and doesn't look a day over 6.
6540	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	for those of you looking for "Grain Free" and "Gluten Free" catfood, read the labels on your Pate style cat foods.  Most of them contain rice. The problem comes in the styles of catfood where it's chunks in GRAVY.  The gravy is made with wheat gluten which can be a problem for some cats.  I have a cat who does not tolerate wheat gluten. For those who might be tempted to say I'm lying should see the number of times in a day she vomits when I don't give her "Grain free/Gluten free" food. She doesn't even tolerate "Grain free" dry food very well and will often vomit that up too.  The pate is the only thing she keeps down.  Friskies and 9 Lives Pate are so far the least expensive option for "Grain free/ Gluten free" wet food for me.  As for dry I prefer "Evolve" - the chicken and rice formula is only about $5 for 3lb and all my cats really enjoy it.
-It's not really wide enough for a large dog with an unsteady gait (unless guided very carefully).  However, if you are a DIY'er and are placing this in one stationary spot, you could likely attach boards along the sides to prevent falling.

I've decided that the manufacturer of Advantage definitely puts some of what they charge into making sure their product is safe. I'd prefer not to need anything like this but we do need it and it didn't make our cats sick at all. And it worked so quickly! About an hour after I applied it, both the cats were jumping around, I'm sure because the fleas were going nuts trying to get away from the poison. The cats had settled down quite a bit within about 5 hours and in the morning they were completely different kitties. No more scratching, biting, pacing around, meowing for no real reason, etc.  It's been several weeks since I used it on them and they are starting to have some trouble again but I think that's really because we got lazy and didn't treat one part of the apartment with diatomaceous earth when we did the rest about a month ago. I'll be using this every month from now on. It's worth the cost, especially at the prices we can get it for here at Amazon.

Would recommend to any rat owner that uses the litterbox method as opposed to pottying in their bedding. This will definitely not work as bedding.
1853	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Mr. Bill is my dog's favorite toy, hands down. In that regard I would have rated him highly. HOWEVER today we had a major incident. My dog finally decided to rip him apart. He was playing with it, it was making its signature "Oh no!" noise... and then it wasn't. I heard a crunch, looked down, and my dog had the noise box in his mouth. The door was completely off the battery compartment and 2 of the noted 3 button/watch batteries were on the floor next to him. So here we are at the emergency vet inducing vomiting to save him. It looks like there should have been a screw on the door to the battery compartment. I wasn't able to find that either so I don't know if he ate that too or if it wasn't there. It certainly shouldn't have come off that easily. Please, if you have this toy, be very cautious. Remove it from your pet immediately if it becomes damaged. Maybe even open it to check for a screw on the battery compartment door. Batteries can kill pets.

3127	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased the Dr. Noy's Extra small bear, small rabbit, and medium lamb from Amazon. I have a smallish breed - he's a pup at around 10 lbs and should max out at around 15. His favorite of his animals is by far his medium sized lamb. He carries it with him everywhere. He has managed to put some holes in all three of his Dr. Noy's, so they definitely aren't indestructible, but they are very sturdy. He is teething currently and they are withstanding that phase for the most part. The medium has an advantage of having a designated pouch inside the toy for the squeaker that the extra small and small didn't have. It makes the toy a little bulkier in the middle and adds some extra popping protection for the squeaker. Great toy!
Of course, none of this matters if the cat doesn't like the food - but happily he *loves* it.

This is a good thing.  Also, the cats seemed to settle down from their scratching and biting at fleas within just a few minutes.

So I make her drop 1 ball before releasing the other, while she fetches, I pick up the ball that's been released.

Well, they tend to exaggerate alot!  These bags are large and they are thick and they don't have a perfumey smell that adds a sickening smell to attempt to mask the smell of poop.  I never understood that anyway. I suffer migraines and bad scents trigger headaches.  I gather all the bags in a 5 gallon hinged can with a yard bag as a liner.

Looking at the labeling on three random flavors (Salmon, Savory Duck, Turkey & Chicken Liver), the ingredients common to all (and presumably the other varieties) are: chicken, potato starch, wheat gluten, pork plasma, natural flavors, salt, guar gum, sodium phosphate, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, DL-methionine, taurine xanthine gum, ferrous sulfate, vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc oxide, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), copper proteinate, manganous sulfate, niacin, d-calcium pantothenate, vitamin A supplement, vitamin D3 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, potassium iodide, vitamin B12 supplement, sodium selenite, folic acid, and biotin. I should try one on a cracker. (Of course, each individual flavor also contains the ingredient that defines it, like duck in the "savory duck.")

One other note is to remember to wash all your bedding and vacuum everywhere (especially your furniture and under beds and furniture with open bottoms) in your house if you have a flea infestation.  Seeing a couple fleas on your animals may or may not warrant that.

210	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dogs LOVE these collards. I didn't realize they came from Fab. but it doesn't really matter to me either. I have two red heelers who would wear anything I put on them, but these rasta collars really pop with their coats! The fabric is thick and durable and in the month or so that the dogs have been wearing them they haven't faded or stretched. The ring is securely sewn in, so I don't worry about the tags coming off of them anytime soon. We even walk one of our dogs with the leash attached directly to the collar. She's a submissive girl, but I've never seen her try to fight this collar off during our walk. (She's gotten out of some other ones before.) I like it a lot, hopefully they make a Colorado branded one soon!
The tablets are easily chewable, and considering the breed of dog, presumably taste good to her.  The tablets are round, slightly smaller than the diameter of a dime, and about 1/4 inch thick.  There is a line embossed through the tablets' diameter to ease in breaking in half.  The consistency is similar to Tums antacid tablets.  The jar is of course plastic, and the lid secures easily.  The lid is not tamper-resistant for those of you who are challenged by common sense, so don't leave it where you do not want it opened accidentally.

When he first started eating it, he would gobble it down.  Now, he slowly eats it and sometimes doesn't finish it.  I think that he needs more variety.  I will order this food again, but will get a much smaller bag since I only have one dog.

The food does have a funky smell that I find disagreeable (-1*) but my daughter says it does not bother her.
I first purchased these biscuits at PetSmart about 6 months ago when I noticed my dog limping here and there - primarily after a lot of exercise.  He was approaching 7 years of age so I thought it was time to provide preventative measures for his hips and joints.  I found this item to be very expensive in PetSmart ($26.99 for one bag, so I decided to check Amazon when I was almost out of the biscuits.  I was able to purchase them for $17.99 a bag - almost a $10 difference!  Being a Prime member, I received free shipping.  Excellent deal all around.

And finally, while I was traveling one weekend, the rakes got permanently stuck and stripped the plastic gears. I managed to repair the thing once - (I'm a mechanical engineer so it was easy taking the thing apart and repairing it, but it wasn't exactly a hygienic task!) - by removing the gears and reshaping the plastic teeth. It lasted another couple months like this, but since the plastic teeth were already shot, when the gears started slipping a second time, I just tossed the thing (metal gears would have prevented this problem or even LitterMaid selling replacement plastic gears would help).

Even if your cat has a flea infestation, just give them a flea bath and use Program. You can also use Capstar which works faster than anything else, and kills all the fleas on your cat in 5 minutes, but is not long-lasting. The people that give this product a bad review need to realize that if you cat is infested, you need to do something about the active fleas and the eggs. Program is an ovacide that prevents fleas from reproducing so it won't stop an infestation, but it's so much safer for your cat. I'll never use anything else.

We only used it for dry food (did not feed our cat wet food) so we never used the cold packs.  We put it on every 6 hours (lasted 1.5 days) and filled it once a day.  When we first received it, we were disappointed since you could hear it when it was spinning (and it was right outside our bedroom), however we got used to it and our cat was trained to know the feeding time from the noise.  I felt the battery lasted a good amount of time.  The only difficulty is the feeder has 6 slots so if you put it on every 6 hrs feeding, it would run out after 1.5 days.  Can put it on 12 hrs and it will last longer.

Typically, I get 2 dinners + 2 breakfasts from a can.  I divide the 12.5 oz can into 4 bowls and refrigerate.  At mealtime I pour hot water into a larger bowl and set his food dish into it.  Cover with a plate, leave for 5-10 minutes, then mix in a little of the warm water, smash, stir, serve.  He loves his thick "soup".

To date, our best luck - and that's an overstatement - has been with the canned brand that provides the cats with an opportunity for fancy feasting. But, even then, that's only with some of the varieties. For instance, they generally don't like "flaked" or "minced", or "sliced."

4306	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I have a Lab mix who loves to play fetch!  It was automatically programmed into his DNA and every day he plays fetch. I have used other types of ball launchers and I prefer this one to the others because of the length and sturdiness of the launcher.  I can launch a ball farther with this one and that's a good thing since my dog loves to run. I like the feel of it in my hand and the ease in which it releases the ball. So why the four star rating instead of five? In comparison to other launchers, this one does not grip the ball as tight so it's easy to drop the ball before you launch it if you aren't careful. It can also fall out while walking with it. I had a launcher that incorporated storage of a spare ball in the handle so that you could easily travel with a spare ball. I really wish this one had that feature. Often times, we play fetch at night and the ball sometimes gets lost out back until the light of day.  With a spare ball easily in tow, we could play for much longer.  Now we have to get out a flashlight or stop playing completely until daylight.

Once again I really recommend the glow ball! It doesn't get soggy no matter how wet the grass or the dog mouth is. It is fun to chase because it is slippery and it collapses when it's squeezed, so it pops out of the dog's mouth and flies away if they bite it at the wrong angle; it's really bouncy, and stays bouncy because it can't be popped; it whistles so you can usually hear it even if you can't see it; and it really glows enough for nighttime catch, even if you only have your cellphone flashlight to charge it up!

It finally wore out and this time we accidentaly bought the smaller version, but we think it actually works better. Maybe because the motor doesn't have to power the rake to travel as far? The best tip I have is don't waste all the money on the receptacles. Buy one box of them and then use plastic grocery bags to "line" each before placing the receptacle in the litterbox. There is plenty of room under the receptacle for the excess bag. Clean up is even easier when all you have to do is pop the receptacle out, find the handles on the bag and pull it out, tie it, and dump it in the OUTSIDE garbage (it's pretty stinky). One receptacle can last for ages that way...and no having to wash them out by hand.

The younger ones have resumed 'running laps' around the yard while the older ones (2 are 11, 9, 8, 5 and 2 are 4) seem younger and instigate play more often than before. They are energetic, not as stiff after a nap or nighttime, want to do more, play more, walk more/further and, while it may be my imagination, the older ones seem to be eating better.

There's an extra place that is like graft paper for side notes or whatever you'd like to use it for. This planner is large but thin. If you wanted to, you could probably punch holes in it and stick it in a binder. I will probably end up putting this in a binder just because I think it would easily get bent up if it isn't in some type of protective case. It's thinner than my monthly wall calendar.

8712	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Not as "Dura" or "Chew" as it says... I bought this thinking it was a chewing teeth cleaner which the dog could eat - ATTENTION AMAZON SHOPPERS! It is NOT. This is a Toy for the dog to chew on yet it is sufficiently chewable that the dor can eat it soon enough - specially if he is a dedicated expert chewer like my GSD - so really the toy beats its purpose if it ever had any. In less than thirty minutes my dog ate the dinousaur's spikes... I do give it to them under strict supervision tho, to throw and what not since I already spent the money - poorly- but what else can I do. Santa Clause through Amazon does not take returns. I do not recommend this product as it is not safe. It is made of plastic, do not be fooled like I did by its white color I really thought it was a sort of bone. So, if you're looking for a good teeth cleaner, keep looking!! Here's how I take care of my kids- Regular cheap rawhide still the best with Virbac's mouthwash every other day, pedigree dentastix when I get to buy some and good raw bones and meat once a week or month.

6058	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	This is a really well built ramp, and the rubberized surface is great. The problem I have, and the reason I'm returning it is it hurts my back to use it. It does not lock open and wants to fold shut until it is placed down on the bumper. It's quite long and wide so trying to open it and maneuver it around is difficult. It also has pinched my fingers as there is no handle, just cut out areas and if you grip too close on the edges of the cut out you get pinched. I'm a fairly large guy at 6' and 220 lbs., so I imagine it is difficult for others as well. Can't ask for a better built product, just not easy to use.

First, let me say that I've only had this ramp for approximately one week, and normally I don't believe in posting reviews so quickly.  I planned to post a review of this product in about a month, but had to post this early in case it helped someone else in our situation with their dog.  So here is/was our situation.  Out of the blue one day while on vacation, my dog screamed in pain when walking up the 3 steps to our motorhome.  It was so heartbreaking and she ended up at a pet ER while we were traveling.  She was put on pain medication until we returned home.  After many unsuccessful vet visits,  it was determined by a specialist that our beagle has luxating patellas (kneecaps that pop out of joint).  She would always walk fine on level ground where no steps were involved.  So we had been carrying her inside her metal crate up and down our outside deck steps so she could do her thing!  A 25 lb. beagle AND a metal crate that has to weigh at least 15 lbs conservatively!  This had been going on since this past May when she experienced her first incident of obvious pain when going up steps.  I looked and researched many ramps, but this one was the only one made with a rubbery surface, although I think the entire ramp is some sort of plastic, but with incredibly good traction.  I did what another reviewer suggested, laid it flat on the floor inside of the house and within a day, with some coaxing and food, she easily walked back and forth over it that way.  Well, today, I decided to put it outside on the steps down to our patio, and didn't think she'd take to going down the ramp, much less up the ramp, right away.  Once again, food did the trick!  She didn't even hesitate, and walked down the ramp to retrieve the food, and back up again to retrieve the food, as my husband stood at one end, and I the other.  So in less than a week, she has really taken to it much more quickly than I expected.  So if anyone is on the fence about it, I highly recommend it, and the weather probably won't hurt it since it's made of hard plastic and rubber.  It has one little latch to fold it shut, but I just carry it sideways folded under my arm like a suitcase to move it if needed.  It will really prove to be a back saver for both my husband and myself!
** Update: 2 years later my dog is now 9 1/2 yrs old and has been on Connectin for 4 years, and I couldn't be happier! Occasionally she gets a little sore after a long off-leash hike, but the soreness disappears within 24 hours, and that's on her normal dose of 1 pill daily. If I double her dose for a few days I can literally do anything with her experiencing no visible soreness. I couldn't be happier with this product. Also, when I spoke with my vet about pup's arthritis and if I should consider doing something else (different supplement or an injectable like Adequan), the vet said dog looked great and continue using the Connectin!

-The ridges are deep (deep enough that they really do prevent the dog from sliding down, but also made it uncomfortable for my dog to go up, as very uneven surfaces are hard for him to maneuver).  Wish the ridges were a bit more shallow, as the non-slip surface seems powerful on its own.

We have been feeding our dogs Purina products for quite some time, and they have not suffered any apparent ill effects.

You know the drill: you have to trick your cat into entering the tiniest room in the home, containing both you and the dreaded carrier.  Closing the door triggers a biochemical reaction deep in your fluffy sweetheart's brain and next thing you know, a terrifying physical transformation has taken place and you're trying to corral a puffed up ball of volcanic anger and tiny whirling knives into the soft-sided rectangular prison of hellcat's worst nightmares.  If you survive this heroic endeavor, you face another challenge: how to prevent imminent escape.  Keeping the carrier in one piece is an equally important goal, of course.  Hellcats laugh in the face of most soft-sided carriers: their flimsy mesh disintegrates at a steely glance, thin nylon or canvas sides melt like butter beneath razor claws, and weak zippers part like the Red Sea if hellcat even thinks of making a break for it.  But hellcat has met her match in the Sherpa Ultimate Bag!  The only devastation my hellcat has managed to wreak on her Sherpa is in the form of a shredded fleecy mat.  This hellcat owner recommends replacing it with something more substantial, or tossing a blanket over it.

However, when used as a stand alone spot cleaner, I was not as satisfied with the results.  The directions say to spray on the stain and cover with a towel for hours while the solution works.  Then it says "uncover to dry".  This process didn't do anything to remove stains for me. Think about it...they have you spray cleaning solution on there but never do anything to extract either the stain or the cleaner back out of the carpet.  How's that going to ever work?  I think if you let it sit on there for a while and came back with come clear water and a clean towel to blot it all up, you'd be able to use this as a stand alone spot remover.  But just following the bottle directions does nothing.  I'll be using the rest of my sample as a pre-treatment prior to steam cleaning.  Works well for that.

Currently we have a 7 lb Malti-Poo and a 16 lb Shihtzu/Bichon. I have rheumatoid arthritis in my hands so while I CAN use a regular leash, my hands will hurt afterwards. Hands-free is the way to go for me. Plus being able to freely swing my arms is an added bonus.

I think on super windy days, it feels like that. If you are looking for a great hands-free system, this one is amazing! The front of the belt does curl from the dogs' loops pulling on it, but that is to be expected. The belt itself is also very adjustable. I used to have to wear this at its largest size (and tight) and have lost enough weight that it is about 5" from its smallest size. I added reflective tape to the lower portion of each dog leash to help with visibility in the morning as well as to all of the front connections. I snap it behind me so that I also have reflective tape behind. (Plus reflective stuff on my clothing and hat AND the dogs wear reflective walking harnesses and collars.)

My 10 month old doberman puppy loves ripping toys apart, especially rope toys and especially tennis balls.  I don't really think this is a very good tug toy really.  It's not very big so it's not really a good tug toy for larger dogs (and really, dobermans are considered medium sized dogs).  I found that my dog didn't really like playing tug by grabbing onto the tennis ball so it ended up with me holding the tennis ball and her trying to get a better grip by moving her mouth onto the rope (too close for comfort imo).  I also can't imagine it's that great of a tug toy for smaller dogs since I don't know if they'll have a very good grip on a tennis ball with smaller mouths.

I must give credit where credit is due - I have used Frontline before for my cats, and have been very satisfied with the results from that one.  However, I decided to try Advantage this time, as I'd heard good things about it, and it was on sale at a discount when I needed it.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Unlike most other topical applications where the flea substance is put on the shoulder blades of the cats and stinks (STINKS!), this has no easily discernable smell.
8217	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Science Diet dog food has always been my dog food of choice.  Three little dogs were raised from puppyhood to adulthood on this food.  Rarely a Vet bill except for the normal shots.  Very healthy and beautiful dogs grew up on this food.  However..this last little one who will be 1 year in June, has stopped eating it and won't touch it.  I am not sure why.  I have tried all sorts of ways of fixing it.  I feed both the dry and wet food..in different bowls.  He prefers the cats food to his own and I am at a loss as what to do.  So..reluctantly I am changing.  That being said..I would still highly recommend this dog food as it has served my pets well.  I am now looking for a food that will appeal to my little Yorkie..and so far..nothing but the cats food will do..and he CANNOT have that.  Wish me luck!

5948	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This contraption is amazing for feeding a cat or two while you are out of town for a few days. I did find it amusing that a boxer is pictured on the box for this item, as there is no way a compartment could hold enough food to be a reasonable meal for any large dog. I feel like having one for my 2 cats to share gets them just enough food. Of course, you can set it to rotate every 6, 12, or 24 hours. This is a nice feature, and in theory would allow you to feed a larger pet an appropriate amount over a day. But, there are only six compartments, so the shorter you set the cycle, the fewer days of feeding the machine will provide. I have not tried the cooling packs that I assume are for use with canned food, but I don't see how they could possibly stay cold long enough to really help prevent canned food from becoming gross. I do recommend using the advance button to have the lid rotate all the way around again AFTER having filled the compartments as a test prior to leaving it. It can get jammed if over-filled or if a piece of kibble gets stuck between the lid and bowl. And, if it gets stuck, that obviously defeats the whole purpose. As long as I test it first & correct any roadblocks, I have not had any issues with it getting stuck. I definitely recommend this for the traveling cat owner who can't afford a pet-sitter or boarding! And, even for the busy pet owner who wants to make sure pets are fed on schedule. This device could be a great way to train or retrain your pet about when feeding time is! My cats used to try to wake me up for food at 4 a.m. I always stubbornly refused to feed them, as that is essentially them training me. But, it is definitely helpful to have an expected feeding time.

Another reviewer said a Littermaid should not be used with kittens under 6 months old. If you were concerned, just leave the switch off and then turn it on when you want the box to be scooped. None of my kittens have had any problems tripping the sensor or getting out of the box when the rake started.

It is no small hurdle analyzing brands for quality (grain free, of course), price, and most importantly tastiness. All along Wellness rated in all three categories, the only hang up being the carrageenan. MANY cat owners WILL NOT use a cat food with carrageenan and I put Wellness aside for a while because of it. But IT IS the cheapest of all the best rated cat foods (20c an ounce compared to 50c+) AND it is the favorite of cats most of the time. All cats are going to have picky spells from time to time, but they are always happy to come back to Wellness! I have 5 cats and all have settled on Wellness! That's amazing in and of itself! I have been feeding Wellness for a good while now and there have been no complications of any kind. However, there is still the carrageenan and about that, I just don't know.

To get your cats to accept it very fast: set it up with litter beside your present box, but leave it unplugged. Manually scoop it for a day or so. Be diligent. Don't scoop the old box at all. Then, plug the Littermaid in, and turn on the switch on to rake, and off when done. Do this for a day or so. Then start leaving the switch on for a few hours and off for a few hours. If the cats go in the Littermaid while the switch is off, go turn it on after they are done and admire their progress. Continue to keep the Littermaid clean all week and leave the old box smelly. The cats naturally prefer a clean box.

8109	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Update:  While I originally loved this product and so did my dogs, I feel the need to update this review.  The Dura Chew Nylabones are incredibly hard, which is what makes them last so long.  However, one of our dogs did crack a tooth recently from chewing on a Dura Chew.  Since then, we have been very hesitant to allow any of our dogs to chew on these as other reviews also state that dogs have cracked teeth.  We have since thrown out all of the Dura Chews that we had.  We are still using the regular Nylabone products (when they aren't made in China), but once those are gone we will not buy any additional products from Nylabone.  We have been buying Whimzees for our dogs for the last two years or so and they are a healthy edible alternative.  They do not last as long because they are edible, but I have the peace of mind in knowing that my dogs are safe with them.  Another healthy alternative would be antlers, which we also give to our dogs and they usually last a long time.

About the box, it does occasionally leave a little poop behind, or small clumps that break down and can't be picked up by the rake, sometimes a poop gets wedged in the rake and it needs a little assistance. but over all, it's a heck of alot cleaner than it'd be with me having to clean it by myself, and my involvement is minimal!

4238	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	While my dog struggles with the concept of returning the ball to me, she absolutely loves this! We visit a huge dog park frequently, and this lets me throw a ball far enough that she really gets to run full throttle! Running is her favorite. Then, she gets to play her second favorite game of "keep away" with the ball. But she will actually let me have the ball back so I can sling it across the park again because she loves running so much. We now spend more time playing fetch than keep away. I could never throw it far enough on my own to keep her interested more than one or two times before getting the launcher. Now, we can spend an hour at the park playing with it. I have one super tired dog when we go home. Tired dog = happy dog = happy dog mom. I also love that I don't have to pick up the slimy ball with my hands anymore, especially after she drops it in a puddle, because the launcher picks it right up. My dog gets so excited when she sees the launcher that she will bounce back and forth in front of me until I throw the ball. I only regret not buying one of these earlier!

Finally, the last case of this flavor has a different very strange smell that doesn't seem right. The date is good, and all my cats except one (Tiger) are eating it no problem.  Tiger picks at it and leaves some.

5905	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	What better way to provide your dog with the potential benefits of Glucosamine?  Although the benefits for animals, such as dogs (and the jury is still out on humans too), are still argued, there are no drawbacks to providing your dog with Glucosamine.  If your dog loves peanut butter, then he or she will love these biscuits.  I selected this brand due to the natural ingredients as well as limited ingredients - there are no fillers, etc. in these biscuits.  Each biscuits contains 500mg of Glucosamine.  I provide my dog with two a day for his size (he is a large black lab, who often runs with me, as well as is an avid swimmer and walks an average of 3 miles a day).  All I have to do is say "biscuit" and he knows what he is getting.  Although if it is past his usually treat time, my dog is sure to remind me!

800	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I got these the other day for our dog. We have a pittie/ boxer mix, about 45 pounds. He loves his treats. I love that fact that the ingredients in these treats offer a pretty small list of items, and are better items than most treats out there. Pitties hav e alot of skin problems from allergies apparently, so when we get generic or cheap treats with bad items in them, he breaks out in rashes. I'm happy to say that these pass the test and he's just as happy today as yesterday and had no reaction.
6085	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This works very well for the intended purpose. We have three dogs that we take on frequent trips in our truck and travel trailer. This is long enough and sturdy enough to give our older GSD/Lab mix a steady entry into both. All three of our dogs use it and it gives us peace of mind that they will avoid injury while entering and exiting. We place it in the bed our truck so that it is handy. It has a non-slip texture that works well in the rain, but is not so rough to rub paws. I am an older female with some arthritis in my hands, but if I wear gloves, it does not present a problem for me to open and close it. Love this for the dogs!

6799	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	The softer texture has pellets that are indeed a little smaller and softer than the pellets in the original version. This litter is flushable and offers decent odor control, and it's absorbent and non-clumping. Also, it's made of recycled paper. All win for me. My cat had little difficulty getting used to the different texture, and she doesn't track it around the house like she does grainier litters. She is a determined digger, so she still manages to kick some pellets out of the box, but cleanup is easy. The odor control isn't quite up to par with Feline Pine, but it's good enough, and with the flushability factor, makes it my favorite litter for the box located in the bathroom.

Original review:  I ordered a bag of Eukanuba Adult Cat Chicken Formula from Amazon. I used to feed the Eukanuba chicken formula and the Eukanuba lamb formula a few years ago with great results, but my local pet supply store quit carrying it. After I could no longer find Eukanuba, I switched to Iams Premium Protection for a while, but the local pet supply store stopped carrying that except in the small, expensive by weight bags, so then I switched to the Science Diet Mature Indoor formula after carefully checking the ingredients list. After Science Diet changed their formula to include cheap and nasty wheat gluten which is nothing except a cheap filler that adds no value whatsoever to the food, I am so glad I ordered the Eukanuba cat food. On Eukanuba once again after a few years, my cats' coats have become incredibly, noticeably silkier than on the other foods. My cat that is sensitive to wheat no longer has watery eyes and dirt stuck to the inner corners of her eyes due to the watering caused by wheat sensitivity, and her stools are not loose at all. Amazon has the Eukanuba chicken formula at a great price right now, and with free shipping, the price can't be beat. The best way to purchase these foods is in the largest size bags as it is less expensive by weight that way. I will keep buying Eukanuba whatever it takes to do so because it gives my cats the absolute best health.
6357	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	Caused my dog to itch.  Other Pro Plan dry foods do not.  I will be switching back to those, but the price was right to try this at least once.

I gave this to my Maltese dog Beau for his 10th Birthday and he wasn't interested in it at all. Thank goodness we bought him a backup toy.
7492	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dogs love these Dino Nylabone's. Over the years I have bought at least 30 of these nylabones for 3 different dogs. Two of which have loved the Dino shaped Nylabones the best. The third loves the nylabone daily dental bone the best but the dino is a close second. The T-Rex is their favorite but they like all dino shapes. Depending on the dog's chewing mood these have lasted anywhere from a month to 6 months before needing replacing. My super chewing husky will chew one up pretty quickly in about a month, my moderate chewing pit bull would take 3-4 months and my slow light chewing shiba inu would take 6 or more months. I typically have 2-3 chewable items per dog (it helps prevent toy hoarding and aggression) and these dino toys are always among the favorites.

2123	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	The first large (extra?) Lambchop I purchased came from Amazon, and my destructo-dog loved it.  He seems to have a preference for toys with squeekers.  It is about half his own size, so he has some difficulty getting a grip to tear things off because it is so plush. While I am a little frustrated by the squeeker moving around in the belly of the beast, the search occupies him.  Then I purchased the smaller one (twice) from the grocery store aisle - one to play with while the other is in the wash.  He knows there are squeekers in the paws, but hasn't been able to "work" them and focuses on the belly squeeker.  The top seam on one of the small ones did come apart even though it was in a laundry bag and is awaiting my repair. I have found them to be worth the expense.  Other toys have not survived his concentrated efforts to dismantle, puncture, shred, or eat them.
4165	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I originally purchased this because I have rheumatoid arthritis, so throwing a ball far enough for my blue heeler is difficult, but I can't even put into words how great this is. I bought a second because it helps my dad pick balls up from the ground with his back and knee issues, and he loves it too. Bonus, my mini schnauzer thinks the launcher is a toy, so she loves it too!
For those of you who still have a Litter Maid and hate changing the trap, I discovered a method to make the task easier and much more pleasant. I'd simply use one trap over and over again, and use a regular grocery bag as a trap liner. When the trap was full, all I'd do was lift the grocery bag (leaving the trap locked in its position), tie the handles and toss, and then replace with a new bag. The same plastic trap would last for several months (and I'd only end up tossing it if it got dirty). Since you never have to deal with removing the trap, it doesn't get cracked and you never have to buy replacement traps (I still have about 8 of the 12 original ones that came with my Litter Maid)

5530	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I first saw the Chuckit line when working at a pet store during high school. I dismissed it as simply a gimmick for people who didn't want to bend over to pick up a ball, and/or had no idea how to throw a ball. Nearly a decade later, I finally decided to give one a try.

7581	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I wouldn't know how good this tastes, but my five cats seem to really enjoy it! The only downside is, because of the size of the chunks (very big), I run through each can very fast. I'd prefer if they were half the size. Otherwise though, I have no complaints!

  OK, down to brass tacks...ProPac High Performance Dog Food is worth every penny down to the last piece of kibble. My Golden is nine and a half years old and has been allergic her entire life to ALL the non-allergenic premium dog foods out there...with the exception of Propac, which is entirely made, from start to finish, in the US (and was never part of the melamine-laced dog food scandal several years ago that prematurely ended many dogs lives).

I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.

I looked at the ingredients on both cans and noticed potatoe , squash, zucchini and blueberries are no longer in the ingredients of the updated version. Wish I'd have known this in advance. It's a lot of money to spend when the cat won't eat the food and you can't return the unopened canned food.

We keep them in our backpacks and take them anytime we are in the woods. I wanted to buy a couple more because we sometimes have a hard time finding them in the various packs and bags we have. I bought some small carabiners so I can clip these on the outside of bags making them easier to find (and being orange they should be even easier to spot).

This is assume just hook them to your head rests and Wella all set to go. I also notice that other people state that their dogs still get in the front with this particular hammock cover. Hello it's soft fabric I would suggest a gate that you can buy so they can't get into the front seat.

I as not nice as it sounds, went thru her poop with tooth picks to see if she had eaten anything outside perhaps and didn't see anything big but did see whites specks of  something in her poop as you can see by the pictures (sorry gross I know but clearly they are visible to the naked eye).

3132	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly "indestructible" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)
We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it.  It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone.  We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.
5105	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I got this to make playing ball with the dogs easier.  However, it takes more strength to use this thing than it does for me to just throw the darn ball!  The ball won't come out of the holder thingy unless I stop the Chuckit abruptly, and forcefully at the top of the arc (using much more than arm muscles), and even then the ball goes about 10 feet straight toward the ground.  I use it to pick up the tennis balls before the lawn gets mowed.

UPDATE (October 4, 2013):  This ramp is still working great and holding up very well.  I took my Saint Bernard with me to the city (we live in the country) and used it all day today, in a snowstorm, rainstorm then dry weather and at all times it was easy to set up on the back of my truck and my Saint just ran up and ran down just fine each time.  The rubberized walkway really helps him get up and down and it is withstanding his 150 weight at the hinges and the walkway is not flaking or scratching off with his toe nails (like another brand I purchased).  This is just holding up really well and I am very pleased!!

I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.
As for whether or not they are nutritionally viable, I think so! I was giving them initially simply to add in an easy-to-dose anti-oxidant, rather than trying to get her to swallow more supplement pills. She has enough just dealing with being dose a b-complex, vit e, fishoil, probiotics, etc. etc etc. We've had to coat her pills in butter until she got savvy and began licking off the butter and spitting out the pills. lol Now, we use salmon cream cheese (she got tired of the plain, ugh lol). It's a struggle to get her to swallow the pills without her spitting them out a few times, first. So, YAY for a chewable that she actually wants to eat! Since giving these (about a month now), I have noticed that her energy seems up, and her allergy issues seem less. Coincidence? I don't know, but I'm betting it's the addition of these vitamins.
6184	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my yellow lab that seemed to be a tick magnet last year. Well, of course since I bought it for her, she hasn't had ANY ticks on her! Last week I had a tick on me!!!!!!!! I ran and got the tick spoon and with out muss or fuss that tick came right off. No trying to grab next to the skin, or anything else to make sure you get the whole thing, etc. Just slide the end right up to the tick and lift. Yes...for me...much easier than trying to use tweezers.

273	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This fit my dog exactly - he is at the top of the measurements for a size small and it is almost snug, but still fits. My only complaint is that the buckle is in the corner of where his leg meets his body - the armpit, if you will. I can't imagine that is comfortable, but he still runs and moves normally. Other than that I love it! Very sturdy and is easier to put on him than other vests I've tried.
I don't know what happened to the cartoon. Perhaps it fell to the floor and one of our cats ate it and later coughed it up as part of a hairball.

We give them each 2 TBSP of the Wellness dry just for something crunchy for their teeth in the morning but otherwise have moved away from dry food for their urinary health and to manage their weight.  Two cats eat a half can per day for dinner.  The vet recommended against even switching flavors saying that animals need to consistently eat the same brand and flavor for optimal results.  Switching flavors can create gastro-issues.  They have been on this flavor and brand for 5 years with great results!  I highly recommend this cat food.

The dogs didn't have any digestive issues that I could notice. They just ate it and layed down for a snooze. Hopefully your best friends will enjoy it also.

* Safeguarding the health of animals and humans
To date, our best luck - and that's an overstatement - has been with the canned brand that provides the cats with an opportunity for fancy feasting. But, even then, that's only with some of the varieties. For instance, they generally don't like "flaked" or "minced", or "sliced." What may work on a good day is the "classic", "grilled", or "chunky." It's a crapshoot.

The food does have a funky smell that I find disagreeable (-1*) but my daughter says it does not bother her.
  3. After a few days, took the pads out of the box and turned box on.

3423	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	my cats ticks and fleas are gone! they had them pretty bad too...after using frontline for 6 years or so...it was no longer working...i had heard they reformulated, so i called the company first to confirm this info and the customer service person i spoke to said they hadn't....either way this did what frontline could not do for both of our cats in either 1 or 2 days which i find pretty amazing as one of the cats was having some major hair loss from itching/scratching from the fleas so much!!! i'm sold! we had a problem earlier in the season with the tiny deer ticks all over the cats and ended up getting a flea collar for such little money, and it worked great until they started to get the fleas...hopefully next year the ticks won't be so bad or maybe just switching from frontline to advantage will do the trick! thanks for all the reviews as i have always been told by the vet and pet store that frontline is the one to get...but after reading the reviews it convinced me to give it a try and me and my 3 kids are glad we did (nevermind the cats)!
1003	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have been buying this treat for my two 10 yr old Westies.  They just love them.  When given to them, it takes them a long time to finish it.
895	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I buy one of these each year for my elderly parents. It is easy to read,  room to write appointments, and they love the pockets.  The only problem is that there too many pretty calendars to choose from!
3152	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Regularly order this for our dogs.  Love the size
6551	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	We have two German shepherd puppies, and they love this food.  We mix this with the same brand of large-breed dry food.  They gobble it right up.  Quality product with no wheat or corn.
8580	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	good product
4300	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	I thought since the Chuckit super balls were so durable I'd give these a try.  These are good for 1-2 fetch outings each with my Labs.  Regular tennis balls are much more durable and can be bought for a fraction on the price per ball.
8576	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Our dog likes this tpy

8814	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	My two cats, (one is SUPER fussy) happily devour this stuff, and have never had bad experience with them "spilling" this food after their mealtime.
1694	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog is in love with it, She beats him up, then cuddles him and grooms him. I expected it was going to be really small but it isn't  although she is small dog the toy is so light weight and easy to bite she can carry it all over easily. A high quality swell made toy, so soft and cushy and he squeaks, This is an excellent deal.

6240	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Been feeding this now for sometime with our Bassett.  Likes the shredded pieces of meat.
Dogs really like them.
3563	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Best poop bags ever. No need to worry that there is a small hole and you just touched poop. Nope, these are double lined, if you will. I will never buy another kind of poop bag again.
4898	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	If you have a dog that loves to play fetch then get this and you won't regret it! It makes it so easy to throw the ball long distances without wearing out your arm so the dog is the one tired when you are done and you can still move your arm the next day. Plus you don't have to touch the drool covered ball or bend over to pick it up!
9141	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My vet recommended this brand and she said it was the best brand to feed your puppy. Don't ever settle for the cheap stuff when it comes to your dog's health. This small size kibble was perfect for my little 7.8lbs husky maltese mix.



6438	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I gotta say I was a bit hesitant about this product but all the great reviews allowed me to feel better about ordering it. I have an 11yr old Husky that has really started showing her age. She was slowly becoming more lethargic, having issues getting up, very stiff joints and sometimes slipped in the process of trying to get up (we have wood floors). I thought it was arthritis perhaps and bought this to see if there was any relief. Within a week I noticed huge improvements in her behavior overall. For one, she became very spunky in the mornings, wagging her tail, running around, this is not like my dog at all. She was always very mellow normally and NEVER spunky when waking up. Cool, I thought! Let's see how this thing works over time. It's been 4 months now and I have to say it's amazing. Turns out after a detailed vet visit and X-rays she has hip dysplasia. I told my vet about this product and her behavior and he said to continue giving it to her. She is not perfect and still an older dog but she is much spunkier on a daily basis, runs around being playful and is obviously feeling a lot better and less lethargic. There are days where she still has a bit of trouble getting up or has some stiffness but overall I've seen my dog's personality change for the better and acting more like her old younger self. I believe in this product and have purchased 3 more tubs (as I plan on continuing to give to her). Highly recommended!
2659	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	More importantly my dog loves his Kong teddy bear toy. He actually loves all of the Kong toys. I worried about the tiny size but that size seems to be what my little guy likes. I also purchased two additional ones for my moms dogs. They tear apart any toy they have ever had. They are chow cocker mixes and they love their tiny Kong toys and carry them everywhere and after two months have yet to destroy them.
8674	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	My cats both love this wet food.
2765	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dogs love this toy so much but it's to easy to rip its limbs off....granted it's supposed to be for my Chihuahua and my Golden Retrievers are the ones that end up playing tug of war with it!

1345	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	This was bigger than expected (my bad, the size is listed) so it was too big for my dogs.
7159	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I give some of this to my cat every day to add some moisture in her diet. It is smooth. She doesn't like cat food with too much texture.
5280	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have 3 chuckits, two of the same 26M in different colors and one of the smaller size. I have had these for YEARS and they are still going strong. My 7 year old golden retriever is obsessed with catching tennis balls, and the chuckit makes is so much more fun for her (as I cannot throw very far). Whenever I get the chuckit out as we get ready for a walk she goes crazy jumping up and down and pawing at the end that holds the tennis ball. It is by far the best dog accessory I own,  I can't imagine not having one! If your dog loves fetch, don't hesitate, this thing is amazing!

This is one great toy, at a reasonable cost, which has provided my puppy with hours of amusement and exercise. I highly recommend this toy.
1941	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Mr. Bill is a gas! He's also very well made, of high quality fabric. The "OHHH NOOO!" is too funny. Our puppy loves it.
5678	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	The Velcro on the inside can be a bit scratchy and I wish there was a strap on the outside but these did the job and help insulate during paraffin wax treatments.

1197	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This is my second Littermaid.  My first worked great but my cat died so I sold it on Ebay.  However, it always worked well but you have to use the correct litter or the Littermaid will not work as advertised.  I never had a problem with the motor failing or other issues I've read in these reviews.  I also read that if the motor jams there is a reset that many user may not know about and this may be a reason for so many returns.  Once again in the year I used it the motor never stopped working.  The box is a bit noisy so I wouldn't suggest setting this in a bedroom.  Also, there is a chance that the rake moving and noise may scare your cat and they will not want to use it. Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.  Then I cut out the bottom of the plastic container that catches the waste.  Now the unit dumps the waste into a 13 gallon trash bag and I can go quite a while without emptying it.  With the stock container you can go about 3 days with one cat.  If I wasn't setting up the table and larger bag I would look more closely at the Smart Scoop.  It seems to waste less litter.
They know I am not shipping such a heavy lug of a thing back...but since they want to post a fraudulent photo product which is NOT what they know they ship...I will make sure my post is here.  They know most people don't complain and want to believe a 10 pound ramp will work [I sure wish it was true] but I may have to get the heavier ramps because this is a HUGE lie.  Even those who felt it was too steep left 4 star reviews not grasping the product photo was false.
949	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Made in CHINA CHINA CHINA. My dog threw up. This stuff is from China. You don't want it for your dog long term health.
