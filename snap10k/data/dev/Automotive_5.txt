Buy two of these motors to keep on hand. The price keeps rising so you might as well get them now. Attach some bright yellow plastic tape to the outside mushroom cover vent of your attic ventilator so when the tape is moving, the motor is on and running so you can see it from the ground. The next time your vent motor stops when it should be running, the tape will notify you then you'll have to climb into the attic to remove the motor. Remove the set screw on the motor shaft and the three bolts holding the motor to the bracket. Leave the fan blade. Disconnect motor wires from thermostat box and leave attic.

Then there was the noise issue. Everyone seems to think this fan is exceptionally quiet for the amount of air that it moves. The fan is impressively quiet but not silent on even the lowest setting and I expected that.

2) The TopSider's pump has ZERO-feedback, so you don't know if you've pumped enough, not-enough, if there's a leak, nothing.  This Hydro-Turf has excellent feedback; within about 15-pumps you'll start to feel resistance to you pumping.  Another 10-20 pumps and you won't even be able to lift the handle because there is so-much vacuum.  This feedback lets you know when you need to start pumping again, while there is still vacuum on the hose, before the oil has a chance to return to the engine.

6490	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the strongest adhesive I have ever seen.  Although it takes a long time to dry and harden (up to 7 days) once it is dry I can't see it ever coming loose again.  We used this to fix the fold down steps on our camper and it seems to be able to withstand the weight of a person stepping on the stairs without any problem.  I guess time will tell how long it holds up to this type of use but for just normal hold I don't see it ever letting go!

2195	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been very happy with my purchase.  My Koolatron kept drinks and snacks very cold with no problem.  As other reviewers have already noted you need to power up the unit roughly 12 hours prior to loading it with items you want to keep it cold.  This unit is not a refrigerator so if you pack it with items not chilled already in refrigerator then it will be a long time before things get cold.
6546	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Used this sealant to repair a door splash guard. The rubber trim was coming off.  Applied a thin coat between the rubber and metal. Seems to be holding up well.
4032	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What's to say?  It's not very large.  It works perfect in my 2003 Chevy truck to add a Fuel Additive into the fuel tank!!!  It should work for Power steering and transmission also, at least on Car/trucks that's not hard to get to or down load were access is bad.  The design helps keep you from spilling when your poring a fluid into it!  For under $5, not a bad deal.  Hang it up out of the way when done with it.  It's able to fit into your Transmission Dip Stick tube, so it has to be small enough, so you can just dump a bunch a fluid into it at once!!!  It's small and doesn't hold all that much.  For what it is, I like it.

1782	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Gotta leave it face down on the newspapers for a few days and it still will let you down a bit but ones it gets some use and dirties itself up a bit it turns into a solid product.

9241	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	...although to feel the full effects it would be better to put another blanket over it, just like you do with an electric blanket on your bed.  We don't, as my wife uses it when I put the top down on the convertible in cool weather.  Another blanket in the car would just be too much trouble.
What's not to love?
8337	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got this to replace some which I "borrowed" from my wife. She's a horsey girl who is very particular about her tack. I used it on the leather seats of my 1954 MG TF roadster. It worked very well. Just please don't tell her that I'm messing with her stuff.

Not a daily driver and truck sets between use and or isn't driven long enough to really charge batteries. Over 2 weeks and truck lucky to start, voltage below 12.1 and it's not without jumping. Other than not good for batteries to drop and set that low for frequent long periods  -dragging out the charger just inconvenient. Standing voltage after a few days generally was about 12.2v and continue to drop. Decided to address.

- Polish headlights with a light polish to buff away any remaining scratches.
This stuff does give off a very strong solvent odor which did give me a headache for a couple of hours; it took 3-4 days with fans going and windows open when it was 70 degrees outside for the smell to dissipate.  The smell reminded me of my grandpas garage, that must be how he kept all his wooden furniture so darn shiny and smooth!  BUT once the smell goes away, the finish and performance is worth it.

9242	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Initially, it worked fine. But after just a few uses, it started "sparking" and we figured that it was not safe, so we decided to return it. The control unit was the piece that made the noises. Just do not trust it.

Use it on your trailer hitch connection and dolly wheel too. Have a spare tire mounted? Be sure to spray the mounting bolts to make emergency removal that much easier. Don't forget the lug nuts and exposed stud ends too.
4233	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I experienced no issues when starting up my laid-up motors (motorcycles, lawn mower, generator, string trimmer) after winterizing them with this product. In a few months ethanol in untreated gasoline will phase separate (ethanol attracts water and the water forms a separate bottom layer). Water and varnish caused by ethanol will deteriorate metal and plastic in fuel systems, especially in older equipment not engineered with ethanol in mind. So in addition to getting less energy content in our gasoline due to ethanol addition, gasoline must be treated with a stabilizer to prevent damage in long-term storage. This is a good stabilizer.

  It seems to stay on the windshield and be effective for a decent amount of time.  When you notice the beads of rain not being quite as slippery as they once were, just apply another coat, the bottle will actually go a long way.  You do not need to soak up a giant rag like in the picture.  Just clean your windshield with a window cleaner to remove all the dirt and grease.  Then use a single square of paper towel folded up to a 3-inch square and add a little RainX to it and wipe on.  Wipe on in a small circular pattern like you do when you wax, really rub it in and all over, get all the glass.  It does not evaporate too quickly so you have time to work it in,  you can wipe till it evaporates or go to a dry paper towel and finish it.  Your glass is now slick as snot to water.  Some little beads can hang on but once you get moving the air resistance blows them right off the windshield.  It is like your glass does not even get wet, just a bunch of little transparent beads rolling off your windshield.  I also like to add it to my side windows.  I have been using Rain-X for 29 years now and still amazed how cool the stuff is come the rainy season.  I make sure to use it on my wife and daughters cars as well.  I tell them to use the wipers, this just helps the view stay extra clear.  If you have cars with crappy wiper blades that just kind of smear the water, Rain X can help quite a bit till you replace your blades.  There is no excuses not to use it.  If you have never used it before, you will be really giddy the first time you try it.

I was thrilled when I tried this on the plastic and 90% of all scratches disappeared and the plastic became so much more clear.  I'm going to start using this on my headlights just as a preventative measure since it worked so well on the inside.

179	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have had use with CHILTON, but Chilton I think is more domestic base, because when it came to imports it lack the overall of the vehicle you are working on. In other words, Haynes expresses between 4cycl to 6cycl, 4x2 or 4x4 on repairs; where as Chilton is broad when it says Nissan pickup trucks; and doesn't break it down as far as all pickup trucks are the same; which they are not! Haynes in my opinion individualizes your vehicle; such as Xterra time frame to the frontier time, same chassis and engine. Chilton would have never told me about that, and not thinking of looking at Xterras, only specially frontiers. Also, the price is significantly less with Haynes compare to Chilton.

Fourth, the mechanism for gripping the ink refill has changed on the new pen. On the old pen, the refill just slides in. It's a lightly firm fit, but it feels as though you're just sliding the ink refill into a cylindrical metal tube. You slide the refill in all the way until it hits the back of the pen and stops. The new pen is quite a bit different. Though I am unable to see inside the shaft of the new pen, it feels as though there is a spring that grips the ink refill as you slide it in. The spring resists the ink refill from going into the pen shaft at the very top, but once you have the refill in a little bit, it slides in very firmly. When the ink refill is inserted all the way, pushing on the top of the refill reveals a little bit of springiness. I'm sure everyone has used a retractable pen at some point in their life that, when they press down on a piece of paper, the ink refill has a very small amount of give/springiness. The new Picopen is like that, whereas the refill in the old Picopen is rock solid and has no give. I assume there is probably a small spring underneath of the ink refill that you compress as you push it in which causes this.
6502	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great stuff and permanent
748	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Install was a breeze!  Motor works great!
Only negative is the clamps slip a little on the Yukon's battery terminal. But I think that has more to do with the location of the terminals on the side, rather than on the top.

9140	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I read the good and bad reviews and took my chances. I let it run for 45 minutes on a drive to town on a 20 degree day, not even cold. It does not get much warmer than just a plain blanket, unless you wrap it around your hands and double or triple it. Flat across the lap there was no warmth at all. I could feel a little heat if I squeezed the blanket between my fingers right over a wire, and then just barely. The blanket is constructed with 2 sheets of polar fleece and the wires are just loose between them, no quilting or any means to keep the wires in any particular place, like a big pocket. With no real contact the heat is as likely to just go out the top as it is to warm you (if there was any). I ended up sending it back. It was to be an extra heat source for a commuter car in the winter for emergencies (above and beyond the sleeping bags already in there) and over a little dog kennel in the car when we had to leave her in the car. The dog would freeze with this thing.
Construction quality I'd rate as average. It's all plastic, and to be honest, the top cover popped off a few times when opening it - nothing that couldn't be fixed in a few seconds, but really, the quality isn't that much different than a cheap conventional cooler. Still, for the price, it's definitely more than adequate to give years of service if you take care of it. Other positives are a long 12V power cord that will reach just about anywhere in your car, and fairly quiet operation that's barely noticeable unless your car is dead quiet and you're sitting right next to the cooler.
3997	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These things are less than $2 and they work just as well as anything else i have used for changing oil and what not. If you need a funnel I'd say get it!
2915	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It fit a Mercedes C63 AMG very well. I only use it indoors when my car stored for the winter so I can't speak to how well it would do in the weather. The label for the 'back' of the car was helpful in orienting the cover correctly.
2283	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I made a fishing friend a super minnow keeper with one of these. He lamented replacing D-Cell batteries in his aerator to keep minnows fresh on his pontoon boat. I soldered tiny alligator clips on the wires of this product & set it to 3V. Now he clips it into the aerator as a substitute for batteries.
3783	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This funnel is of good quality and is the type of plastic that will bend and not break. It is long enough to easily stick in your vehicles gas tank filler opening and it will keep the spring-loaded filler door open. It has a nice opening so you can pour in your fuel injector cleaner or other additives, or pour in gasoline from a gas can without making a mess.
7151	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	this kit is good, but the oxidation remover  only lasted for half the boat, my boat is 21 ft long so if yours is this size or bigger, u may want to buy some more. i bought a 3m oxidizer remover in the purple bottle that made short work on the rest of the gelcoat. however meguiars does make nice products .
6085	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is genius. I have two trailers with a 2" ball, and one older boat trailer with a 1 7/8" ball (why?). This is an elegant solution to the problem. There's no way to lock the balls on the post, so I keep the balls in my truck so they don't get stolen. When I need to tow, I'll just dig out the right size ball and toss it on, it only takes a second. I can do it without a screwdriver, it's not that tricky. I've had this on my truck for about a year and haven't had any problems taking the balls on or off, even after getting the hitch muddy. I'm not towing anything heavy, my heaviest trailer is maybe 1000lbs, but it tows just like any other ball.
5734	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Was a replacement that broke when dragged the hitch pulling out of a gas station.  Works great.
The rain truly does bead up when applied properly.  Also it helps to prevent ice build up on my windshield in the winter.  I would definitely recommend!

8583	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	After seeing all the great reviews on this extractor I ordered it thru Prime and received it in 2days.  When I saw the box, I immediately noticed that the name and model of the unit was different than what was shown on the amazon description, but the extractor looked similar, just a different branding sticker on it.  Then when i opened the box, I noticed some marks on the extractor tube, which made me think this item may have been used or potentially damaged.  Regardless, I was content with keeping it, if it worked with no issues.  I went to do an oil change on my audi a4 (b8) and it couldn't hold a vacuum in order to keep the oil (which was warmed up) flowing. I'm an engineer and have worked on cars since I was a kid, so I certainly trouble shooted to make sure it wasn't human error on my part and that in fact the product was not functioning as designed.

3296	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Very good product when applied correctly. This means clean your windshield well. I washed, then clayed mine and dried it off completely. Then apply Rain-x with a clean and dry towel in a circular motion and let dry to a haze. Make sure you do this in the shade. Wipe residue off and it works great. Doesn't last all that long but works flawlessly while it does.
5783	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great
***I wish to pass along what I learned after purchasing my last fan.  The older style has a solid black plug.  The newer model has a red LED in the plug that glows when you plug it in.  Per the manufacturer "There is a problem with some of the plugs with LED's and they build up too much resistance due to poorly soldered connections".

8783	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	great
5605	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It works well with my 2001 Toyota Highlander V6 base model.  It is plastic.  Obviously, more expensive materials are going to increase price of item.  It is priced fine at around the 10 doll amount.  If treated well, it should hold up to normal driving just fine.  I agree that it may add another attention getter for rear traffic.  For mine, the sheath that protects the wires did not extend to the adapter area, so I wrapped some electrical tape around the wires to provide a bit more protection for them.
A good set of jumper cables is a must in any vehicle, especially if you live in the frozen North (Cleveland here). Sure, you can buy some cheap 12 gauge or whatever at your local big box store. But I have personally been in situations where the cheap-o cables simply could not carry enough current to jump my vehicle. The cables were too thin to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time, and could not carry enough juice to turn the starter.

It charged for several hours and then went into "Charge Aborted" mode.  I tried it again and got the same result.  I tried it again with a different car battery and it worked fine, eventually getting a green light and going into "Maintain" mode.  Perhaps the first battery wasn't capable of being fully charged.

Best hard core glue out there in my opinion,  just wish they made it in black.
Tip: I found that it's easier to remove and install the motor with the fan already firmly attached, because access is limited to the Allen set screw once the motor and fan are up in the bracket. So, I attached the fan about 1/2" from the end of the motor rod, which allows room when passing the assembly up past the mounting brackets. Yes, a little wigglin' and jigglin' is still necessary to seat the motor bolts into the bracket holes.

Cons:

Primarily though I just wanted an inverter that I could run at 500 watts or usually less for months or years continuously if need be without the worry of it burning up.  It will be primarily used on a solar power battery bank that will drain and charge the batteries in the 200-500 watt range.  I wanted durability and I feel this inverter will provide that.  If it doesn't I will surely report back...

Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot.

What we want to do here is replace the seized motor with the new one but attach longer wires to it and the thermostat box so we can replace the motor next time by removing the mushroom cover on the roof pulling the motor up and out, unplugging it and not have to go into a hot attic to do it again. I use 14 GA. male/female plastic covered push connectors on the wire ends so I can easily unplug them.
I have now been using the new light for a couple of months, and have had no issues.  As with any light, be sure to unplug your trailer before backing into water, or your bulbs may burst due to the temp change (that previously happened to me on the other side - live and learn, rookie mistake!).

4480	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I like the textured grip for removal with only hands.
8135	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Its started out great. Barely use it, but within a couple of months it was becoming obvious that the ratcheting system was giving out, binding, and over all gave out. Maybe the weather got the best of it, I could sat there and lubed it every two weeks, but I need something to just sit there in the work truck without major maintenance or I got bad one.
I think a vehicle with all it's windows treated with rain-x is a safer vehicle.  Increased visibility in bad weather is so important because other drivers may be less likely to see you and road conditions will afford less grip, making avoidance maneuvers treacherous.  The best defense is to gain those extra split seconds by seeing what's happening sooner with increased visibility.  If you're the driver that can see better and is the one that's less distracted and diligently pays attention to what's going on around you, you'll be the one that gets to your destination safely.

My truck has 5qt oil capacity, and this container will hold a maximum of 6qts on a flat surface. The walls are very thin, so when you pick it up full, it will bend.

In a nutshell, when considering a battery backup, you have two main options.  A separate battery powered sump that installs as a second pump to your primary.  You mount the battery backup pump slightly above your other one so that if the first pump fails, when the water rises to the second one, it pumps the water out.  The biggest issue with a second pump is that you need to install a second set of PVC pipes and merge it in with your existing pipes.  Installing PVC pipes isn't exactly hard, but it takes some planning and a lot of extra pieces.

This stuff about the pads falling apart is nonsense.  I did my large truck and put a fair amount of pressure on my orbital polisher.  The pads, other than looking a little dirty, look about new.  I'd say they hold up very well.  I am going to order a few more as today I put my wax on a little thicker than I should have and my polishing pad got a little wet.  Trying to polish after that got a little rougher than I would have expected, but luckily I was almost done and remembered I had two hands and a rag.

I got the package in the mail today, and immediately took the #17 to the fishfinder screen with a clean white washcloth and started rubbing it in.  For the first few minutes, I thought I had wasted $25, but after about 5 minutes of rubbing the cleaner in (with only a few drops applied every 90 seconds or so) it was obviously working well.  A firm, quick buffing action, alternating between little circles and up-down, left-right motion, and in about 7 minutes that screen looked like it had just come out of the box.

They even give you the ability to replace the motor brushes when they become worn.  It takes just minutes to blow the water off of a car.

3335	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This funnel is perfect for adding oil to my air compressor. The fill hole for my compressor is very small and you can easily waste oil by trying to fill without a funnel. I like how it's extra long because the fill hole is next to other components, wires and switches and with a shorter length funnel the top would be too low, you would still have to aim the pour of the oil to reach the top of the funnel. This long funnel makes it super easy. Other than that there's not much else you can say about a simple funnel. If taken care of this will last a long time.

9259	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Many years ago my grandfather had a heating pad he kept in his car for hit back on long car trips. No matter how long it was plugged in, that thing never seemed to warm up at all.
1974	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just bought this one as a repeat purchase for another car.  I carry them in my cars for the sake of convenience.  They pickup dust quickly and back in the door pocket it goes until next time.  The only draw back is the red lint (not much tho)  it leaves behind.  After many uses this does go away. These are cheap by my experience and deliver good results.
7403	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely Love these! I'm a dog groomer in a mobile van so getting my dogs really dry before turning on my power sucking dryer is vital.  These really absorb the water, and the dog hair rinses right off a wet towel. I wash them at the end of the day and roll them back up quickly and reinsert them into the tubes...they go right back in.

8353	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is pretty impressive oil. I found it difficult to find locally which is why I ordered it online. We used it on all of our outdoor teak furniture and it immediately brought the color back to the original finish. It does have an odor so you have to be careful on using it on indoor furniture. This oil is very durable and lasts a long time if applied correctly.
19	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Used this several times now.  NO, the "suck" isn't amazing.  It does its job on light stuff but won't pull dry grass that velcros itself into auto carpet.  Don't expect a shop vac here (and even that doesn't get some of those suckers).  The extension hose becomes almost useless as the vacuum drops significantly at that distance.  However!  I love the longer card and the product itself seems sturdy and well-built and does what it's supposed to do for getting up the dust and similar.  Actually I have to say it even got a couple of pieces of lighter gravel.  Great for light touchups in my RV and easy to dispose of the mess.  Nice carry bag to keep it contained and the bonus filter gets a thumbs up.
1549	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Really difficult to install.  Certainly wasn't designed to work when installing a radio is a Polaris RZR. This is not a kit, it only is one piece and nothing else.
summary: a good small clean-looking gauge at a good price that you don't need your reading glasses to read.

9368	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this tool when a friend asked if I could help him change a timing belt on his Honda Civic.  I had never done a timing belt on a Honda before, but after a little research a knew enough that I should pick up this tool.  To make a long story short, plans changed and I didn't change the timing belt, but now I have this tool.  I'm not complaining, because I love having specialty tools in my tool box, but I was sad I didn't get to try it out.

6536	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great fan! Works well alone or with air conditioner when extra circulation is needed. The three settings are perfect. The velocity for each is noticeable. The subjective "noise" reported by other reviewers doesn't bother me. Some level of noise is expected. I use a AC/DC converter when I'm plugged in to shore power. Works great!
5878	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Save your money. I thought that it would work like the mildew spray from the same company but as good as the mildew spray is...that is as bad as the rust remover is. It just does not work.

Make sure if you purchase a buffer, it has the 5/8" dia. arbor, you will be able to buy disks and pads anywhere.  Definately get the hook-n-loop system, it will save you lottsa time and aggrivation in setting up and changing over the pads.  This wool buffing pad is really heavy duty, with a curved outer edge to eliminate the possibility of burning the the paint.  The pad cleans up easily, even if you use an old fork to clean the compound off.  There is a little wool blow-off, but thats common with a new wheel.  With the right compound and care, this Wool pad will last thru years of service.

2865	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	GREAT
5673	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I originally bought it for taking the fog out of Jeep windows but ended up getting a new top and not using it.  I then had a scratched Plexiglas door on my boat that I figured I would give it a try on and WOW, was I impressed.  In less than a minute the door looked better than new.
Just wish the spout was a little more flexible. Holds a good amount of product and dispenses it very well.
7889	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Worst thing I've ever bought.  I purchased the 1st one in January.  They replaced it in February, because the "C" clip that grabs the shaft would not open to allow the lock to slip onto the its shaft.  I worked OK the next couple of times. Then, it got to where you had to really work the lock to get the C clip to let go of the shaft, so that you could remove the lock. This went on for 3-4 times.  Then, yesterday, I was going fishing and I could not get the key into the keyway no matter what I tried.  After about 15 minutes, I had to get a bolt cutter and cut the lock, which I might add, was quite easy to do.  I bought a new boat in January and I've taken the lock off/on maybe 12 times.

7410	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have had an Absorber for over 10 years. I have used it constantly during that time. Among other things, I teach swimming at the local YMCA. Getting in and out of the water using a regular towel was absurd after the third class; the towel was soaking wet and useless. So around 10 years ago I bought my first absorber from an auto supply store. I have used ever sense and I am still using it. I bought the second one because I got tired of buying chamois for drying my Suburban. The chamois is marginally better when it comes to absorbing water but the difference is so slight and the long-term cost difference is so great it is well worth the purchase.
5909	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	keep your connectors clean & corrosion free w/a little dielectric grease & these. I use 4 pin flats on motorcycles to hook up electronics so they're easily moved to other bikes or removed for security. I bought extras.

3243	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you live someplace rainy, get this! We live in Arizona so it's not as frequent but when it does come down, you pretty much don't even need wipers because the water just beads down. Bugs come off easier, too, as long as you keep up with it. It's kind of like wax for your windshield.
7840	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	care on purchasing  -there are 2 measurements in the listing -the one in the general and the one in the product specificications  (which is the wrong measurements.
3342	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	As always, this product works very well, lasts a long time, and is versatile. I use it on my bathroom mirror too, to keep it crystal clear during hot showers, and to repel toothbrushing splashes.
9855	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I added this K&N filter and then a week later added the BullyDog Turner to my truck... both together I picked up a couple MPG's and greatly improved my driving enjoyment.

Holds about double its volume in water and leaves not a streak.  We love this for drying our SUV and Corvette.  Highly recommend this product.  Bought 2, one for about $10 and one on sale for $7 at walmart.

4331	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased 2 of these devices for my trucks that don't get used too much and wanted to keep the batteries from sulfating too much. I have been using them for about 6 months now, and they keep my batteries at the correct charge levels. I have them permanently installed with a heavy duty outdoor grade extension cord out of my grill so when I bring the trucks back to my shop, I just get another extension cord and plug it in to the wall socket. Since I am a HAM radio operator, I have rigs in my truck, it is perfect for those days when I am tuning the antennas, or programming the radios. Don't have to worry about my battery going dead either.
Very pleased with it!!
-You have to store it moist in the canister or it will dry stiff as a cardboard. (Dip it on water and it is good to go again).

In summary: if this were a $25 fan (ignoring the first dead on arrival), it would get 5 stars.  But because of the price and the things above it barely scores 1 point.
2388	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's sturdy but do not use it for bikes with aluminum frames.  The clamp down feature can cause distortion on aluminum bike tubes.  I have had one of these for a number of years to carry our Wallyworld grade bikes and it works very well.  It weighs about 35 pounds and is built very strong.  It is/was made by Reese Products the hitch people.
1571	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Having used it twice I can say this, it's easy on my back, which is why I bought it. It does an OK job though. The mitt doesnt fit real well but it does the job. When sucking soluton into the barrel it will leak out on its own so in a sense once you've filled it up you have a 4ft long wash stick.

2403	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	perfect fit, nicely extends the cargo area of the standard basket.  Only problem was that when I went to remove the screws to disassemble the original rack so that I could install the extension, I found that one of the screws was stripped.  This could only have happened at the factory upon assembly of the original rack.  This made it a pain in the rear to install the extension cause I had to drill out the screw and replace with something else.  I am very disappointed in Yakima for this.  Has nothing to do with the extension - it's a problem with the original rack.

9603	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	It looks great on my dodge durango and it was easy to install. the only reason why I gave a four stars is it would be better if it came with the mountings... that was the only problem, so I had to wait another 2 weeks for it..but the steps it self was awesome...love it..
5410	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	There are "fancier" models of this mirror but for an affordable price, it's easy to attach the the windshield of a boat.  I use my mirror to help to watch skiers, as well a see what is going on behind me in general.  If money was no object, you may want to consider a "higher-end" model with suction cup mount etc.  I opted for this because my boat's windows are tinted and I didn't want to stick a suction cup the window tint.  I've hit this with my head a few times and it has not broken.  The build quality is okay but I doubt that it could withstand extended abuse.  I'm happy with my purchase and the price paid for this mirror.  It helps to makes my boating experience more safe on a budget.
6859	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is the best product for sealing boat parts below the water line such as struts, tracking fins, and rudders.
Overall well worth ~$15. It pays for itself easily after preventing one spill, something that can easily set you back $50 at a car detailer.

1466	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Purchased at Fred Meyer (similar to Walmart, but bigger). I have to say I hated regular glue on patches. They were messy, time consuming, and although they worked, it was a hassle to prep everything. These save a few of the steps. Primarily, you just prep the surface by sanding, then affix the patch. That simple. I've used them on my 700x23c tubes at 130 psi with no problems.

I wanted this for my on/off road adventure motorcycle because I go on long multi day camping trips and need a way to overcome almost anything that could go wrong.  I bring everything I need to get the bike back on the road or survive a problem without anyone's help except for the people in my group.  Usually, there's just one other person with me, and we can share the load of tools and supplies if we are careful.  I installed a couple 12v lighter adapters directly wired to the battery on my motorcycle for this purpose, and to power just about anything.  This charger is larger than I would like to carry in my motorcycle luggage- the yellow core section is about the size of a flattened softball but rather light.  The cables are plenty hefty but rather heavy.

3338	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is a miracle, I always apply this when going on our yearly driving vacation. The rain just slides right off the windshield, you don't even have to run the wipers unless it rains heavily. Just make sure you clean your windshield very very well before applying. That is the trick between a good application and a great application.

On the minus side, they're bleepin' heavy, took a lot of effort to transport up and down several flights of stairs to get them into my car, take up a fair deal of space (I have a 2010 Nissan Altima Coupe, and while I think it's a sexy car, the trunk space is laughable), and weigh down my car...

The handle will easily unlock to make adjustments to the lengthen or shorten the handle.

4041	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had never changed the plugs on my Victory Kingpin, so I was a little nervous. But, I had my bike up on the lift while doing an oil change, so I figured I might as well change the spark plugs. They were a bit tricky to remove - I ended up using some needle-nosed pliers and they worked perfectly. Anyway, after I got my extension bar on my ratchet and got the old plugs out (the one in the rear was pretty crappy looking), I was able to put them right back in with no issues. I snugged the plug wire boot back on them, lowered the bike down and it fired right up. Works for me. :)

I noticed I had to play with the hose a couple times while sucking the oil, but it was able to get all the oil out of both my mom's mustang and my sister's sonic.  I no longer have to get under the car to change oil! I hope to use this for years to come!

When I am done using the absorber, I simply wring it out and put it back in the case.  I have never machine washed it nor let it dry out.  It has no odor or mildew after 10 plus years!  It is ready to go whenever I need it!
6105	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Meguiar's PlastX Clear Plastic Cleaner and Polish does the trick of cleaning off oxidized and cloudy light lens after six or seven uses of this cleaner, it provides a light coating of polymer to protect your light after it has been cleaned of oxidation and cloudy film, Meguiar's PlastX plastic cleaner works wonders on light to moderately cloudy lens, I applied this to both my car lights one was moderately cloudy and the other light just had a light spot in one area of the lens that it removed in one application, the other light had more cloudiness, what I did was apply one light coat and rubbed with a little firm pressure with a back and forth motion alternating with circular motion as I was cleaning rubbed until I did not hardly see any of the cleaner then allowed it dry to a haze, then I just buffed off with a microfiber cloth, this left the light much clearer and newer looking, I then left it about two days before I started the whole process over again to my amazement the light was looking far more cleaner and clearer than it did the first application, then I skipped a day again then started the whole process over again, did this until I reached six or seven coatings, now my car light looks brand new, Meguiar's is the best so far and does what it says as all Meguiar's products do, if Meguiar's does not help your problem then you either have the cloudiness inside the light which then you would have to change the light altogether or your lights are really yellowed and damaged alot by the sun and the elements then this product will not help you but for light to medium cloudiness then this stuff is awesome and would recommend this to all who have a little or some cloudiness.
2138	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I highly recommend this net, as it has full plactic hooks (not plastic coated metal ones).  The price was exceptional and is a great value.  These nets are so much better than single line bungees, for items such as helmets and jackets.

2986	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just received this item.  It is definitely commercial grade.  Have tried it out on all four tires on each of two vehicles.  Gauge is accurate enough.  I've have seldom had two gauges that read exactly the same.  This one is within 1/2 pound of my current high quality gauge.  The numbers on the gauge are easy to read.  The incremental markings between the numbers are more difficult to read but perhaps it's time to get new eye glasses.  I'm very satisfied but will do a follow-up review should I have an issue after more extensive use.

7856	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works very well at absorbing water. So much so, that I'm constantly ringing the water out of it while drying the car. Practical though, because you don't have to waste a bunch of regular towels - just squeeze it and reuse. Has the texture of a thin piece of leather. Doesn't scratch the paint, unless you get some dirt caught in it. And if you clean the car thoroughly first, that won't happen. It does need to be put away damp though. If you don't it'll dry out very stiff. It claims not to grow mold/mildew, even when stored wet, though I haven't tested that out long-term. Short-term (two weeks) it seemed fine.

It says that you can put it damp in the storage that comes with it but it really smelled bad so I simply fold it and let it dry. It dries very fast and simply turns into a solid rock when it is completely dry. Simply wet it before use and you are ready to dry out basically any surface :)

6140	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this on my truck which had very yellow headligts from being in the sun for over 10 years. I used a cordless drill with attachment and this polish and my headlights are now crystal clear. Very impressed and it took less than 10 minutes. I tried using this on the plastic covering over my speedometer and gauges etc but the results were less than favorable. This is probably because that plastic was flimsy and hart to push hard enough to get the polish to do its thing so most likely not the fault of the polish. It was just hard to get into that small space and really buff it out..

I thought it worked great for us, and did its job.  Kept things cool.  We bought the AC plug for it to be plugged in at night at the hotel we stayed at.  You really have to get things cold first, then keep the cooler running at all cost.  We basically ran it 6 days straight between the car and the hotel and it never missed a beat.  Beware, I plugged in the cord backwards one night and it cooked our food!  Yes, it will also work as a great warming or hot cooler if you are not careful.  Enjoy!

2324	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I believe this product's bad reviews are from people who do not understand the different ways this relay can be used or wired.

The VW went into so-called limp mode unexpectedly, check engine light illuminated and stayed lit.  The car would operate in lower gears in a strange fashion and did not want to shift into fourth gear.  At the time I was driving home with fifty miles to go on a rural highway that alternated between two and four lanes.  I had autoscanner handy and from what it told me I decided driving the car in limp mode would not cause further damage.  I just had a long way to limp but I cruised along in third gear at 4000 RPMs while other cars and long haul tractor trailers passed by angrily when they could.

I had knocked a hose loose when I changed the air filter on my 2003 Toyota Highlander, and the check engine light came on. I checked what I had done, and re-connected the hose, but the light stayed on. The last time this happened, the Toyota dealer charged $90 to shut the light off. For only two-thirds that price I got a tool that I can use again and again and shut the light off myself. Out of the box it took only two or three minutes to read the basic instructions, plug it in, read the codes in plain English, and hit the reset button. No more Check Engine light!

921	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This lock has been a very  secure lock with high praise from my welder who says that this lock is the best he has seen. I'm told that it is highly cut and burn restiant. This gives me a secure feeling that when I lock my equipment with this lock that I will find things as I left it. I am going to have to order some more locks, for I need about ten locks keyed the same.
7360	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This was a direct replacement of my trailers factory 5 (4+ground) wire plug. All the wires were long enough to run new if needed but i only had to go the end of the Tongue.

4881	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The Absorber is the only Chamois I use to wash trucks, boats, motorcycles, etc. It is very soft, doesn't scratch the paint, and rings out very easily. It also stays moist in the tube for weeks when not in use.
I tried several pumps from each chemical squirted into separate cups as a test. I then poured the chemicals back into the cans when done. I found that if the pump handle is very carefully pumped down while applying a slight lateral pressure in one direction, then I get more reliable results. Then doing the same procedure on the upstroke. However, it did not work 100% of the time.
I should relate also that when the unit arrived, it was missing a part.  I contacted Masterbuilt and their customer support was terrific.  The part was on its way the next morning.  All-in-all, I am very happy with this unit and expect to use it for many years.

8873	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Super easy to attach and remove with key.  We love how quick it is to attach and remove.  Now there is no reason not to put it on our vehicles.  Granted, it is not 100 percent theft proof, but I think most criminals will look to the quick and easy theft, as opposed to using a saw to cut through your steering wheel.
817	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great quality and price. Will be buying from here from now on.
The instructions warn against having the light/beeper on for more than 2-3 minutes, because of heat issue.

989	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I used this heatgun for loosening rusty old bolts on a 1987 E30 as well as for general heatshrinking and it's handled both tasks with ease. The accessories and box that come with it are handy and let you store everything neatly together.
For the use on the boat, I highly recommend this product.  After washing boat, a quick wipe with the absorber keeps all the water sports off of the chrome and aluminum.  It also keeps water spots off any waxed areas.  Sometimes, we go fishing very early in the morning and the seats are wet with condensation - the Absorber is perfect for a quick solution.
Clings nice and resists wash off.
9528	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I like the manuals over the unreliable automatics, that's a given. But these hubs have some shortcomings, apparently as cost-cutting engineering from Warn.

8950	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I must say that I can't quite understand the folks who didn't like this clock. The case is 3 1/2 inches long by about 1 3/4 inches high,......and the display numerals are almost a FULL INCH tall. It's easy to set, and can mount with the provided tape or screws. You simply touch the right side and the blue light illuminates the dial perfectly. The black case is nice looking too. Keeps perfect time also. The display numbers are huge,...... and can be read from across the room. Highly recommended.
First, they really absorb lots of water off a soaking wet dog. I may have to ring them out a couple of times to get the dog pretty dry (way drier then I can get with just a towel).

9600	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This is my third Lund interceptor over the years and while it looks and seems to perform well, it is obviously not as well made as the previous versions.  The attachment points are now reduced to 4 holes in the plastic through which you insert 4 screws into factory holes in the hood.  The older version had 6 attachment points that consisted of metal brackets that you placed yourself along the hood and held in place with allen head pressure screws.  The bug shield bolted to the brackets.  Plus the older shield was stiffer and more solid.  This one bows when the air pressure from the car wash blowers hit it, the other didn't move.  Again, I like the looks, but the quality seems to have gone downhill.  We will see how long this one lasts.  The last one made it 11 years!

4951	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Par for the course as Convert-a-ball is a loser of a company with ZERO R & D and no improvements over the years.  If I could give it a zero, I would.  The lid only has tiny catches on the long sides and it is cast out of limp plastic and the bulging sides don't grip the base so the lid pops off.  It should hinge and be attached permanently.  It is third one I have owned over the years and the only option.  They know it and abuse that fact in their lack of improvement.  If a company could just come along and do it right these guys would be history.  Lack of competition breeds complacency.

It also seems pretty ridiculous that car manufacturers have 134 ft lbs holding that bolt on. I broke 4 extensions the first day and couldn't get it loose. The second day I put the breaker bar on with no extension and only a deep well socket, grabbed on real tight to the front bumper with my hands and used my foot on the breaker bar, it finally broke loose!

All that isn't necessary with the High Road Organizers trash bin. It's weighted really well. As long as nothing heavy is in it like a full cup of coffee or a gallon of liquid, it won't top over because the weight is about a pound (half a kg) and it has great traction grips on the bottom.

7382	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have two long-haired giant schnauzers and use these for drying them off.

I will be ordering more to make swamp-cooler jackets for the dogs, since they love to go with us outdoors during the Florida heat and have black hair/fur.
2649	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I am rating this four stars for the price, if it wasn't so cheap to buy I would rate it lower. The biggest problems I have with this tire changer are related to the mount / dismount bar, the bar really should be longer for more leverage and for mounting the tire it tends to pull up from the rim. I saw one reviewer here modified theirs to make the mounting bar stay on the rim when installing a tire and I did so as well.
2mpg is awesome considering I have a 1999 4x4 Expedition! Actually got 17mpg on my last trip!

6286	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Much too flimsy. On first time out I accidentally ran over one. It flattened out. Better to pay a little more and buy the heavy duty Chock. If you don't drive over it, I suppose it would be okay.
I have a 1996 Honda Civic, and apparently the car is easy to steal. Mine was stolen from a park-and-ride while I was at work. They recovered the car in mostly very good shape, so I bought this and I've been using it ever since. If your car is one of many in a big lot, this will hopefully make the thief move on to someone else. Sorry other people at the park-and-ride!

4836	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This thing is amazing. It absorbs so much water so easily. It is easy to wring out. It is comfortable to use... it has revolutionized the way I dry my car. So much better than any other chamois I have used.
2209	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this scanner when, within a week three of the cars in our family had the Check Engine light illuminate.  Since the light was intermittent in all three cars I wanted to find out what the problem was (or at least narrow it down) before taking them into the dealers.  Intermittent problems are a nightmare for repair techs since they can't always duplicate the problem.

1547	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	This plastic is 1/8" thick and solid. The thing that you need to know is that the box is tapered from the front to the back in height and width. Inside height dimension in the front is approximately 2-3/4" and the back at 2-3/8". The width of the box is also tapered with the inside front dimension being approximately 7-3/4" and the back at 7-1/4". The length to the outside of the flange in the front is approximately 9-3/4" and the back is 9-1/8". The depth (front to back) dimension from the outside of the flange is 8-3/4" straight across (no taper). It is a very solid box with a mild textured finish that looks good. I needed the box for something that was rectangular shaped and the height and width of the taper in the back of the box interfered with the fit so I couldn't use it but it looks like the box would accommodate most common radio sizes but wanted to mention the taper and outside dimensions of the flange so that you can take that into account if needed for your project.
8991	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this Steering Wheel Lock because after 5 years of use my older Club 1000 doesn't work anymore and I expect that the newer model have to be better than the older one because the price is around $20,- higher than my Club 1000 (my fault).
6301	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have eight of these things now.  They hold-up great, are dirt cheap and you can't lose them in the grass because of the bright yellow color.  If you abuse them enough, they will show wear and tear, but that's if you abuse them - you know, like driving over them instead of moving them :-(
3438	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this product for years.  I apply it each time I wash/wax my car.  I don't have to use my wiper blades as much since water is repelled.

They also have a tag with insructions attached to the cables, but if you need to read them at all you should do so very carefully.

So up today we have Meguiar's G12310 PlastX Clear Plastic Cleaner. The purpose of my purchase here was to help restore and protect the headlights on my Infiniti G35. My headlights still look clean and somewhat clear but every time they were washed they kinda dulled up a little bit. This product worked as designed for the most part and was easy to use. After washing my car I would put a small amount on my headlights and taillights and work it into an even haze with a wax sponge. The product is easy to manipulate and has small granules in there which I am assuming is slightly polishing. After wiping the product off the headlights, they look clean and clear. This product by itself will not restore your headlights if they are badly oxidized, but if you are just looking for some light cleaning and polishing, this stuff will do the trick.

Some other reviewers indicate that they don't stick, but I've never had a problem with mine.

9743	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	What can I say? It's a K&N. Great product and great deal from Amazon
3970	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is good for steel but don't try to use them on mag wheels or aluminum. They won't work. I bought this for the tire on my RV but it wouldn't work if you wanted to use it on the Honda rear tire hanger. I bought the mag whell locks from Autozone. The only thing is they only sell four. But you have five on the car with the spair. So I ended up haveing three extra. Ohl well. The one here for the stell rims is a must . People today just steal to steal and sell your tires. So protect your spare you might needed it some day
The only problem with them is that the float charge phase is always on. When power outage is not that frequent, it could cause battery being overcharged. I had contacted factory to see if we can turn that float charge off or off after certain hours to avoid the battery overcharge.  But they told me there is no modification allowed.  The result of that is the battery dying in about 18 month to two years.
For the price when compared to a headlight "kit" that costs $15-25, this is a no brainer.
4031	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The size measurements provided are a bit disingenuous. The funnel is 10" long but the section that comprises the tubular section is only 6" long. It states that the funnel is 4" x 4" but in reality the opening for the funnel is 2-1/4" in diameter at the widest point.

9859	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This product was a normal drop in air filter.  The accelerator response was increased.  The truck doesn't spin out as much (when not trying).  There was only about a 1MPG gain.  The main reason I bought this is because it is reusable.  The truck doesn't work as hard at higher speeds (interstate).  Good product.  I would recommend changing the whole air intake if you want real horsepower gains.
2033	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you have a rig with a standard plastic dash these are great. I'm kind of a neat freak when it comes to my cars and I hate when people use spray stuff to clean their dash/interior. It just makes the sun glare in your eyes due to the shininess.

I used this to wipe my car dry and it really works well.  Throw away all of your $10 for 25 towels - just buy this.  It will take about 2-3 mins to get used to it, you have to just lay it on the surface let it suck all the water and then squeeze the water out of it.  Repeat.

It is sturdy and durable, and the provided container gives great convenient storage--these chamois last for years with proper use and stand up to the test of time. Only a small note for new buyers: don't forget the chamois on the driveway! The product stands up to pretty much everything--except being totally dried out and "baked" in the sun!
ALWAYS buy 2 or 4 gauge. ALWAYS buy long cables. I don't care what anyone says. Cars are low voltage but high amperage. A starter cranking needs a TON of juice. Those dainty little WM cables will not cut it. Enter these cables.

If someone is looking for a long term heavy-duty cover, than this might not be a good choice. For the money I paid I am pleased with this cover! If using it on a car in a garage, it seems to be it would last a very long time.

8914	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using the original club now for 6 years, and combined with other layers the various vehicles I've had over that time period, it has proven useful.  I wouldn't depend on this alone, but combined with a good car alarm, and some kill switches makes for a solid theft deterrent.  But, there have been several times when I've only had the club for anti-theft, and I've been fine.  I'm pretty convinced that as a theft deterrent, it still takes about 30 seconds to a minute more for a thief to boost a car with a club than without, and when you're lifting cars that aren't yours, every second is a second that you can get caught so prolly best to move on to some easier pickings.  I've never had any problems removing it from the steering wheel or placing it on there.

2028	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nothing beats a California Duster for dusting your dash and interior, especially in a dusty area like New Mexico where we have a 6-month windy season. Effortlessly lifts and removes dust whereas most the off-brand knock-off's just move it around. Becuase of the wax coating on the strands, it does not acquire a static charge like the off brands, which can be dangerous with touch screens in many vehicles nowadays. Small enough to keep in your car if you would like.

5509	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	A very small section (about 1/2 inch) of plastic step pad was not completely adhered to the chrome piece, but that is just being extremely picky.  It wasn't perfect, but it came in great shape.  It is sturdy enough to stand and bounce on.  I used the shim included and followed the instructions and it does not move at bit.  I purchased it with the Master lock 1480DAT, so it doesn't walk off.  I purchased it mainly to keep people off of my rear bumper on my 4runner.  It looks good and I have never had an issue walking into it or snagging my leg as I walk by.  For the price you will not be disappointed.
The factory manual has diagrams, not pictures, so it's easier to see what the instructions want you to do, and where things are.  However, the pictures really aren't that bad in the Haynes manual.  To those that complain about it - get some reading glasses?  They seem perfectly good to me.

9864	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Let me say that Amazon is usually verygood at shipping and sending the right product. But when it comes to K & N air filters, I would say go elsewhere. The drop down tabs won't produce the right filter for your car or truck. I can't believe they could be so messed up! Even when you verify the right part number through K & N the measurements are incorrect on Amazon. I ordered 1 filter for my 2002 F-250 and 1 for my 2012 Hyundai Sonata and both were wrong.

3117	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I'm not sure why this isn't standard on vehicles. I don't even have to turn my windshield wipers on with most light rains, and it gets better on the interstate. It took me all of fifteen minutes to apply this to the front and back of my car (wouldn't recommend side windows or the rain may roll up into your car if you have the windshield visors). Buy an inexpensive bottle and save your blades wear.
I'd return the one I just bought if it wasn't a hassle to get it packed and shipped back to amazon . . . . I guess I'll just use it as a deterrent hoping that a car thief sees it in the steering wheel and leaves my car alone.
513	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Battery works great. Seems to last longer than my son's attention span when driving the car. Just a side note, after doing my research, I thought this was the proper replacement battery for the Lightening McQueen car. It is not. The connector didn't match what was on the car. Being a bit handy I was able to make my own connector for both the car and the battery so it wasn't a big problem. Just make sure that this connector matches the one on your car or truck.

One more thing, no matter what it says, it can indeed get moldy. No matter what, DO NOT store this in a dark place. First the smell arrives, then the spots and before you know it, you have an absorber that has mildew damage and while it still works, it won't last as long.
Good basic plugs. I recommend them
3041	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My wife had a professionally applied water repellent treatment done on her new windshield.  She raved about how the rain droplets just fell away when she was driving.  Didnt need to use her wipers while moving.  I saw it work and I was impressed.  Based on customer reviews I bought Rain-X.  Following the directions I wiped on two coats.  I live on the Northwest Coast so the rain is without mercy here.  My first drive with Rain-X on the front and rear windows was incredible.  This stuff works and its just as good if not better than my wifes shop applied coating.  When moving at 25 mph (or 40 kph) the water simply slides away.  No need for windshield wipers.  I have a large rear window on my Impala with no rear wiper.  Dont need it.  The rear window stayed clear.  This is a first for me when driving my car in the rain.  Ive read the negative reviews for Rain-X. Its obvious that those individuals didn't apply the liquid coating properly. Its unfortunate that some people will critize a product that they didn't use correctly. Anyways, Im sold.

I'm off the cycle of replacing the hardware and strongly recommend you skip the replacements and go buy another brand.

7569	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Very clever idea. Had to use on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara with a lift kit and adjustable drop hitch. Spinning ball hitches for different sizes won't work in my case because the adjustable hitch height is a solid piece specific to the entire hitch. In order to tow my 2 different trailers I'd need 2 drop hitches. Interchangeable balls is the perfect solution and I have to say these are perfect. They work well and are rated around 8k pounds of towing. Saved a lot of money here compared to my closest towing accessory store.

4206	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	I drive in snowy icy roads a lot!... This stuff works, and has protected my big-rig under-frame, chains, and all the other things that would have normally rusted away, in heavily sanded and salted roadways. I have used this stuff every year. I even spray it on some of my exhaust clamps and it helps them a bit too. It is NOT a permanent solution, it does eventually wear off, but it takes a long time to do so, even after pressure-washing. It also works on electrical harnesses to seal them up. I soak my truck down once a year, just before the snow with about 6 - 8 cans. It isn't cheap, but it is worth the protection.

8312	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This does what it's advertised to do. The suction cup holds well. I've used it on the side of my jeep with the doors off. I've used it the side of the steering console on a pontoon and I've used it stuck to a windshield on a ski boot. It's nice to be able to move it around.

I also used the oxidation remover on the headlights of my car.  They were really bad.  They were improved by about 75 percent after two applications.  If they hadn't been so bad to start with, it would have done better I think.
6656	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love this product and great value for the price!!!
All in all this is not a bad purchase. The hose that fits down the dipstick tube is very nice quality, the remaining components are good enough for their intended use. Nothing exotic or overly high quality, just good enough.

8750	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Good shield for the price.  Handle with care to prevent scratching.
4862	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these to dry my vehicles after a wash for years. I'm sure they have many other uses, but this is what I primarily use it for. It leaves the paint looking great with no water marks or lint left behind!
3280	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Works as advertised, will buy again.
972	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I got this to replace the plug in my 7 year old Bolens riding mower with 18.5 horse engine.  I wanted something that would work well and have a strong spark.  This platinum tip plug will have such a long lifespan, I know I'll never have to replace it again.  The mower is well taken care of and runs beautifully and I really want to keep it running that way for a nice, long time.  Using quality parts will help assure that.
Its a very hard job. I would say I would charge 500.00 plus to do someone else s but would never take on someone else s unit. Takes per side about 4 hrs but I have to stop because it will wear you out holding polisher tightly and letting wheel and compound do its job. Its a good workout. But the end results are well worth the time. My trailer had medium oxidation, but people who used it that claim they started with a chalky finish have had the same end results based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I AM sure with a BAD OXIDIZED chalky finish you will need to constantly clean the oxididation it removes off the pad. But years of not cleaning and waxing require the pain staking process that goes along with removing all the dead finish to get down to fresh.
8561	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome.
5720	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Got this discounted with no apparent signs of use. Easy to maintain, no surface rust  as reported by others  when kept clean. In fact no tendency of dulling after 2 months of use. The step comes handy to get in and out loading the huge cargo area in our Sienna. Gives more expensive look to our Ltd. trim, as well. I remove it only to couple the trailer. It sits low, so I cannot say how will help, if I get rear ended. Top molded plastic piece  provides adequate grip for me. Overall is worth every penny spent.

3580	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This funnel works perfectly, pour liquids into the big end and magically they come out the small end in a fashion that doesn't make me spill them all over the container I'm filling!  It also doubles as a bugle.

5306	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp.
3751	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These aren't the easiest to find unless you drive around to various auto parts stores, etc.  I like the shutoffs for gallon jugs of windshield washer fluid, and for things like bleach bottles.  They give you a bit more control over the flow and splashing of the liquids.

2230	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	If you have a car that throws consistent "Check Engine Light(CEL)" warnings or a car that has an intermittent CEL, you will want to have one of these on hand. Also, car dealers are not the most trustworthy so if you take your car to the dealership for repairs, you will want to have some idea of what is going on before you talk to them as 9 of 10 will lead you astray without pause or guilt. Also, the dealer will be charging you up to 2 hours labor just for hooking up a similar piece of equipment to your car to see what the computer tells them, then they stack on another price to check it out manually.

Although I've never had a problem with the small cap, the top lid is a joke at best. It's either loose or semi-screwed on. In either state you will lose a lot of oil. The 2 times I risked taking it to the oil depository I had it on top of old carpet, etc. in the trunk to absorb the oil that might spill.
3216	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked as expected, good price
8125	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great for a extra bar on the ceiling under the  cap
2207	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an easy to use inexpesive product, especially when you couple it to getting the Amazon credit card.  Instead of shelling out over $100 for my mechanic to tell me the check engine lite was a nusance lite, I can check the status and clear the lite myself and keep up with any problems that may be lurking. Best thing I've bought for my Jag in a long time.
2444	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Work's well with a hitch mounted bike rack.
I can't comment on how this would fare in a marine environment on a boat or in a always wet one, like a shower.  But on a bench in my front yard, it's great.

8949	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This clock is exactly what I was looking for. I have an old 1966 truck that I wanted to put a clock in. I have been to many auto parts stores looking for an easy to read clock that had a large display. I also wanted it to have background lighting so I could read it at night. I had no luck at all finding was I was looking for until I found this clock on amazon. This clock is perfect for my needs. It is easy to program and the display is nice and large. It is easy to read from all angles in the cab of the truck. Reading it in the dark is easy too. You do have to momentarily push the top right button to make the back-light come on. If it was back lit all the time I'm sure the battery life would be pretty short. It does come with strips of velcro and screws for installation. I just glued a small magnet on the battery cover and stuck it to the dash. A lot of older vehicles have metal dashboards. If you are looking for clock to stick up in a small place that has a decent display. I think this one is for you.

9584	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Got this for my 2003 F-150 Heritage Edition. Instant power increase, better get up and go and just all around a much better set-up than the stock filter. I feel like I got a slight mileage increase, but it's been hard to tell for sure with the crazy sub-zero temps we've been having here in MN lately. Regardless of that, this filter will save you money in the long run either way as it will outlast the truck you put it in and you'll never have to buy another one.
9842	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The correct air filter for the vehicle was easy to find and fit like a glove.  Highly recommended and never have to replace again.
8587	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	Read the reviews, did as suggested. After driving the car at 70mph for a half hour I came home and immediately inserted the tube, left the oil cap off and pumped up the unit as directed and the oil started flowing. Looks great, It works!?! After about an hour the oil is now cold and we're still only only about 1.5 litres along. So much for warming it up. Day 2 and we're still trying to get the last 2 quarts out of the engine. Yes it works, but very slowly, especially for 5w-30 synthetic oil. 20 minutes to do an oil change as one review suggested? Maybe on a lawnmower! Used by a professional mechanic? Not on the job or they'd be unemployed!
8811	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Cheap materials, but works fine.  Would be nice if the stem locking mechanism was a little easier to work.  My previous pump lasted for years, so hopefully this one will as well.

Severe: Heavy duty headlight restoration kit

4264	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a truck that now sits outside unused for too long. Even my expensive, heavy duty battery runs out of juice after a couple of weeks. I mounted this to the L-bracket and then placed the bottom of the bracket underneath the battery to secure it. The cord could be a couple of inches longer, but I found a way to keep it poking under the hood. I've used it through a very cold winter and my truck has started right up every time.
9356	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	works as advertised, too bad you only use it once in a car's lifetime.
5672	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Just receive it today. And apply this product to my old cars. It works amazingly. Shine like new headlights. But don't know how long it lasts.
They work good too. I like them.
4276	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	these chargers are going by the wayside and hard to find - the "custom chargers" that let you select different modes are just fine unless you lose house power...then you have to reset them - this charger does a great job and will come back on line after a power loss - a great way to keep a stored vehicle charged without having to check it constantly
3215	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Fits my 2007 Regal 2450 Cuddy perfectly.  Before you replace this item, grab a light meter or voltmeter, and make sure your switch is actually broken.

It has a screen under the lid part which is ridiculous. It actually splashes falling oil onto you and other things. Not only that but mine has fallen inside of the container.
1481	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Gave this to my dad and my brother in law as a holiday gift and they both love it.  Very compact and simple to use.  Sure beats those darn dirty, greasy, clumsy jumper cables.
9863	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works great as a direct replacement for my 2003 silverado intake. I would buy again but i don't have to now! Haha great product i love it, my truck seems to love it too.
So when the PV2000FC arrived, I immediately returned it for a refund. Since the error was mine, I was required to pay for return shipping. (Thus, a somewhat costly mistake! My bad!)
So all in all this filter allows for less changing (money saver in the long run), and better acceleration. Im not sayin it turned my taurus into a sleeper, but it did make it feel like I was getting the most out of my stock setup.
4540	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have a number of vehicles that get little regular use, from farm equipment to collector cars. I have been looking for a charger like this for a long time. The charger mounted very neatly near the battery on one antique car and looks like it could have been factory installed. Easy to connect without having to move separate battery chargers on and off the shelf. I have had it about a month and if it continues to perform well, I plan on buying several more.

Also.. If you ever discontent the battery form you vehicle, make sure you start it with the remote starter key fob soon after reconnecting the battery.

6081	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I have an Infinity G35 with the large plastic headlamp covers. Over the years they became hazy and cloudy, not terribly yellowed, but hazy enough to make them look old and faded. I bought a cheap no-name headlamp polishing kit from a store and used the sanding pad, polishing compound and buffer wheel as the direction showed. Actually looked even worse when done, didn't work at all. The dealer wanted $75 to do the headlamp covers and I was going to have them done but then I saw a commercial for Mcguires PlastX cleaner and thought what do I have to lose to try that first. I couldn't decide on the Mcguires polishing kit or just the compound and I decided to try just the $8.95 polishing compound to see if it made a difference.
644	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	The Coleman Cable 08665 12-Feet Heavy-Duty Truck and Auto Battery Booster are great, heavy and fit perfectly into the Arsenal 5888 Cable organizer.  Hopefully i don't ever need to use them but better to be prepared than sorry.
I can't imagine anyone not giving this product a perfect rating.
Very easy to install HOWEVER, if you drive a GM product you'll probably need a 4-wire adapter and while you're at it, order either a 1-foot or 2-foot 4-wire extension. I had to use the 1-foot extension to install mine using the 4-wire plug adapter (GM uses 7-pin round). The tail from the light was too short to round underneath the bumper/hitch and come through the opening in the bumper where the plate is mounted. I did NOT want to run the wire directly from the brake light to the adapter. I then used two black zip-ties to attach the wiring to the hitch bars, keeping it from hanging down.
1022	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This is a great design but executed very poorly.  The concept of a large opening up top and grille to catch the drain plug in the oil pan is smart.  The side spout to drain oil is also well thought out.
1435	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	This was extremely disappointing. I have had a version of this for both of my cars for the last few years. One of them seemed to be dying so I bought this as a replacement. The difference was startling. My old one had a reliable green, yellow, red sequence. Red came on reliably at the same point. This unit did not. The picture with the light pushed through the garage wall that someone posted said it all. It is completely unreliable. It usually does nothing until the red light comes on and then you have no idea whether the car is in the right spot or not. I took it off and repaired my old unit instead.
5404	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	works great

Most truckers put a bulky cooler on their passenger seat. I tried this and wanted my seat back. So I bought this little cooler and it holds a half gallon bottle of fruit juice, 8 bottles of water, lunch meat and several pieces of fruit (larger coolers had so much wasted space). It sits right next to the passenger seat so I can easily reach for an ice cold bottle of water while I drive.

1001	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	I've have two of these and trust me its not about IF the cap will leak but WHEN.  The cap is made from plastic that gets brittle when it comes in contact with oil!! Why Rhino will not change this easy to fix solution is beyond me. Even the large main cap on the top does not close securely enough to carry the container on its side without oil leaking out.  Do NOT buy this.

6900	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Great product, great price
8233	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.

987	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	A very basic but serviceable heat gun with two heat settings and three additional nozzle attachments make this unit a solid performer.  I particularly like its light weight which makes it easy to wield; if I have a complaint its that the overall size is just a bit large and can make working in confines a bit difficult.  Still and all a very good unit with a reasonable price
 2. Once it extracts 2quarts/Liters it'll slow way down (like the reviewer I mentioned said). I gave it an additional 10 pumps this sped the extraction up until I hit 3.2-3.5 quarts/liters I gave it 5 more pumps and pow over 4 quarts out of my 2006 Grand Prix

5180	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Awesome.  Just used this for the first time earlier today.  I've owned a natural chamois but haven't used it in years so I threw it away.  This works great.  Washed my car and then used a Water Blade on it (def another recommended product) and then used this on all the corners and tight spaces.  Soaks the water up very well, rings out a lot of the water and stores "damp" which means little to not maintenance to maintain.  Covers a lot of area too I was surprised once I unfolded it just how big it was.

2598	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Good protection for the money; fits larger helmets (i.e.: Dirt helmet with long visor).  Mine came with the "Raider" logos which was kind of a bummer as I was hoping to get an unlabeled one as some other reviewers received; must be hit or miss when it comes to the logos.  Other reviewers have complained about a "cut" in the bottom of their bag; this is by design.  The slit is for drainage and is reinforced.

8236	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it.

4830	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I love this thing!  This is actually my second one I had to buy because I accidentally left the other out of the tube overnight (don't do that).  The best thing about this, is that it does not leave scratches or swirls on the paint of the car, and it does an awesome job absorbing the water.  I would absolutely buy this again, and suggest it to anyone that is on the edge on buying one.
7833	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I thought this was the entire module minus the lights. It was only the lens and that was what was advertised. I would specify in the information that it is ONLY the lens. It worked out and I was able to re-use the old one.

Finally with these we can all be as warm and toasty as we want to be!

NOTE:  jumper cables transfer a LOT more juice very quickly, 100's of amps; you can normally jump by working directly off of the other car's battery if your battery is not completely depleted.  This unit will not let you jump directly from another car's battery- it charges your battery.  Your cigarette lighter adapter only lets 10 amps or less juice to charge your battery (10 amp fuse, 10 amp wiring), so be patient.  If you can't easily reach your battery when you raise your hood, this product is for you.  If you have easy access to your battery, then buy some jumper cables and learn how to use them.  It is not hard.
519	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	FOrtunately, package still had two batteries as ordered. I plugged them to charger and they charged right away OK. Will put them in Dora the Explorer and test tomorrow. Will throw old battery away, since charger seems to work OK.
This package includes a LOT of product.  A huge improvement from the small, single-use packages they used to make (or maybe they still do); this is a much better value.
My unit is still working great, and my clamps are holding up just fine.  Some of the negative post about breaking clamps, I wonder if they changed from the unit I have?

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The diesel vehicle i am working on may also have a current drain issue when switched off. Which makes a true float charger even more important in the interim.

1015	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	The oil drain pain in the picture on this product page clearly shows a pour spout.  The ones that are being shipped do not have a spout like this, they just have a small section of the rim that is pushed out.  This is essentially useless as a pour spout and the oil just flows over the rim and onto your garage floor/driveway.

3524	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This is an unparalleled cleaner for all types of metal. I love to use it on stainless steel, it works really well for sinks, appliances, etc. It never ceases to amaze me how much dirt comes off, that's invisible to the eye. For this purpose, make certain you use it exactly as the directions state, use a soft cloth, and go with the grain of the metal....it's much easier. It also works well on base metals, and I've used it on some of my pieces of jewelry too! I love that it doesn't have any fumes to contend with, and seems much gentler than many metal cleaners I've tried in the past. You don't get the feeling you're wearing away the finish with this product. It also leaves no residue. That's a problem with oily stainless steel cleaners for appliances, they tend to attract dirt very quickly. I really prefer Flitz, but if you plan on doing larger areas, especially on a regular basis, make sure you get the larger (7.6 oz) size. I haven't tried Flitz on plastic or fiberglass yet, so I can't comment on how well it performs, I'm impressed enough with how well it does on metal!

2176	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	As a cooler, it does well. Basically it's a cooler that you don't need to hassle with ice packs. And it will keep things cool as long as you have a power source. Nice for long drives.
To keep mine fresh and growth free, I've simply machine washed it (only with my microfiber to prevent lint transfer) after every single use. Making sure to store it as dry as the washer wrung it out. Sometimes I go months without using it, and it may be rock hard, but ready to go the moment I drop it in some hot water. I find it absorbs the most if I dip it and wring it in hot water before drying a car. It seems to open the pores of the PVA.
1262	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Nice buy but all the rivets are 1/8 with various lengths.  Probably my fault for not reading more carefully but I wish there were a greater variety of diameters  and head sizes.  4 Stars because the rivets are good but not 5 stars for the reasons above
7499	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Some other reviewer complained that the max tow was only 8000 lbs, when he expected 10,000. Here's the thing -- if anyone's trying to tow upwards of 8000 lbs, you need a class IV hitch which requires a bigger ball shaft and is designed for higher tongue weights. I've seen too many unsafe trailer setups on my travels, so buy what you need and don't try to overload the design. That being said, this set is fine for me as I frequently need to change ball sizes for different loads. I couldn't find the 3 ball set anywhere locally, so Amazon was a good choice. The only thing preventing a 4-star rating is the "made in China" label. I'm just fed up with nearly everything we buy being made offshore. It looks well made, however, and should last a good long time.
7931	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ideal for my boat trailor
Had this vac for over a month now and really like it.  There are other vacs with good ratings that are just that.  I really use the light on this one often, and the pump is great for getting some air in bike tires when on the go.  The guage is a big plus too.

7869	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Searched high and low for a gas gauge for my Yamaha Rhino, under $150.00, none to be found. Can't see the fuel level in the seat tank so decided to cut a hole in the tank and mount a sending unit and this gauge on the dash. Be sure to use  a 2 1/16th hole saw, not a Fostner bit, keep the plastic particles out of the tank. If you need to clean, use Duct Tape on a extended grabber tool to suck particles out of the tank. I was very careful and caught the hole piece before I sawed all the way through, then used a sharp knife to finish the cutting of the hole in the tank. Tank is actually quite thick material and accepts wood or metal screws just fine, they don't have to be too tight if you use Permatex BLUE rtv gasket sealer, it is impervious to gas and oils. Be sure to cut and adjust your fuel sending unit arm to go all the way straight down for an accurate EMPTY reading on the gauge. The full mark will read correctly in any position obviously because it is floating to the top position.  I used a Moeller Marine 4 to 28 inch long Universal sending unit also here on Amazon, and it worked perfect. The entire project took 1 hour and cost under $50.00 so now I have a gas gauge with a light in it and fits nicely in the dash of my Yamaha Rhino.

4901	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I like the Convert-A-Ball system. I have a number of trailers and three different ball sizes. Convert-A-Ball makes it very easy to adapt to all trailers.

This way the trailer prevents the pin from trying to remove itself. The vendor via Amazon was very  pleasant and professional!

It's a handy product and works great.  The only concern now is when the car tire is at the top of the first bump, the car rolls forward and I sure hope that the mat hasn't slipped forward or else there would be a fast roll into the wall (I have about 1-2 inches of space to work with before touching the wall).
8480	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	For a test run I pumped the oil out of my power washer cold.  With repeated priming or pumping of the plunger it took 20 minutes to get 20oz. of oil out of the engine so once I used it for my six quarts of oil boat it is going to take quite a while but warming the engine could speed it up quite a bit but it does get the oil out with little/no mess.

5379	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she's Made in Japan herself.
I installed two so far and it was very easy!  The unit is designed to be permanently mounted under the hood, it comes with a bracket and some screws.  The first thing I did [I know it voids any warranty] is open it up and de-solder three wires from the short 12" cord and upgrade to a 14 gage 3 conductor cord of adequate single length.  I routed and zip-tied it to blend in with all of the other factory wires and ran it to the front lower valance [bumper] where I fabricated a simple aluminum bracket with grommet pull-through opening and terminated at a plug.  Now to use all I have to do is plug it in, no need to even open the hood.  With it disconnected you can barely see the plug from behind the license plate.  Total time about an hour and a half, if you are less particular I guess you could toss it in and be up and running in 10 minutes.  So far very happy, I have taken some measurements of the capabilities and thay are as claimed.  Almost forget, pics on amazon are not totally accurate, does not gome with a fuse holder for battery side.  I added a 5A blade fuse with all weather holder to the positive side between unit and battery for peace of mind.
955	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I had originally bought a double flaring tool from a store with HF as the initials.  Like many others, it constantly slipped, I couldn't actually get a double flare, only a single flare.  Tried everything but couldn't keep it from slipping.  Bought this tool, just got it today, and tested it on a scrap piece of brake line, 3/16".  Using the adapter that came with the HF tool, it easily held onto the pipe (same pipe I had tested the HF tool on, but always slipped).  EASILY held on.  Did the first flare, removed the adapter, did the second flare, not going until it stopped, just until I felt it had flared sufficiently.  Did a beautiful job!  Honestly looked better (thicker rim) than the factory flare did on the tubing I was testing on.

4083	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was in a pinch, as I un-assembled the wheel and was all ready to install a new bearing when I discovered my 1" bearings were not the right size.  Went to a couple of stores only to find that all that anyone carried was the 1" bearings.  So I ordered these and they arrived on-time and fit perfectly.  As one other reviewer noted, they do not come pre-greased, but honestly I have never bought a set that was pre-greased.  Otherwise, they installed fine and seem to be working good.  I did finally put a proper bearing buddy on, so these bearings will hopefully last a few years.  Will be ordering 2 more for the other wheel and a spare.

There is a sucker born every minute,and I was one of them.
3489	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	This funnel is very good for pouring additives in most cars with filler necks high on the rear fender.  The "splash guard" or offset flare makes it simple to pour without splashing, or trying to pour almost sideways as would be necessary with a typical funnel.  I was using one of those flexible 'accordion' funnels to get a more vertical pour, but the ribs, or convoluted part tends to trap a little of whatever you're using and may cause cross contamination.  I found this funnel to be very ergonomic and undamaged by any fluids that are usually found in a garage.
6073	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	I used this product a few times on one of my headlights that was starting to oxidize and it covered up the problem, but within a few washes and a few more applications, it actually made the oxidation worse. Maybe I used it incorrectly, I'm not really sure, but I haven't used it since. That headlight was eventually restored by a professional and then replaced as it got damaged in an accident. I do like Meguiars products, just not this one. My other headlight is starting to look a little shabby and I decided to use Ultimate Compound by Meguiars and it has done a much better job. I also used it on my girlfriend's and dad's headlights and the Ultimate Compound really cleared away the oxidation. I then followed that with some carnauba wax, very nice.

2091	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I sometimes have gatherings on my porch and needed an ashtray. I had a wide one, but the wind would blow the ashes and butts out of the thing all over my table and floor. This works perfectly to keep the used stuff neatly inside the container. Mine did arrive with the two top pieces unattached (not sure if they were supposed to be that way or not) but they were simple to slip in the slots. Very happy with the item, keeps things convenient for guests, yet NEAT for everyone else.
The price was reasonable and I'll keep the unit.  But if I would have picked this one up in a store I would have probably passed and bought something that felt a little heftier.  I'm giving it 4 stars since it seems to be working fine and I like the mounting holes in this one.  I'm taking one star off because it just feels a little cheap.
I purchased this item in order to construct a GASOLINE-FREE, OFF-THE-GRID, PORTABLE POWER GENERATOR for use when public utility power fails.

So this is still the best tiny keychain pen. The magnetization on the cap is strong and solid, and the pen is shorter than my car key. However, there are a few changes to the design since I last ordered this pen in late 2014. These details are noted below and in the pictures that I have uploaded.
3248	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	Lasted three months.  Sometimes the wind blows off the cover, which isn't a problem. This morning there was a huge hole in the middle of the cover, like a giant kid took a bite out of the center of a tortilla.  I touched the fabric slightly, and it started to rip.  I guess it is good if you keep the car in the garage, not so good if you keep the car outside - which is the point of having a car cover. Lame.
7331	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Nice wire and worked great for the harbor freight folding trailer. The white wire was the perfect length for the "floating ground" it used.  The wire was longer than needed so just trim as needed.  Better to have more than less.
7860	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	they work great j
9406	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Worked great. I broke two crank bolts loose the day I got it,no problem at all
1473	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quick Summary:
8413	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	great price
5885	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Works as expected

4957	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	The only item I buy for my vehicle
3799	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	looks really good,would take the average thief a while,you will need to drill a bigger lug exit hole though, easily done,only thing stronger is a heavy chain type lock through the hub hole,i like it
9362	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Changed the timing belt in my 2002 Civic this summer and it's a must have tool. Worked exactly as designed.
6535	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Used this on a 38 state 3 month drive about. Use it currently in crew cab while stationary to help circulate air. The feet screws need to be siliconed in which ever way you plan to use it. Bump it over, and the lock scew will loosen and leg will twist. I have this happen just moving from floor to center console. But it is a very good fan.


7686	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	These are great. Just like others have mentioned, I wish I had known about these before. These are perfect for dedicated use on a specific piece of equipment. You set the length, push on the lever and they are set. Pull the lever and they release. What a novel idea :)
7290	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's great at soaking up messes, but do not run this over your car if you want perfect paint after a wash. These chamois tend to pick up debris and scratch paint. Most professional detailers say to never use these, but use polyester microfiber cloths instead.
8727	Automotive_5	NEG	1.0	After testing this on my ATV I removed it.  First the foam lining is thin but will still snag on your gun (I even tried gluing it inside the case using foam pads to compress the lining which worked until the first time a gun site snagged and then it was a mess getting it free). Second, there is LOTS of case vibration even with the Kolpin mount (too much to risk ruining my scope zero or risk damage to the scope).  I just carry my rifle slung over my shoulder and a cross my chest while riding.

2221	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Convenient, easy to use, does exactly what it says, explains what the codes mean, says what it's doing.

4410	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Have one on every vehicle. Saved wife from service call at home! Made van start after an hour. Must have for colder climate areas. She now plugs in every night, no problem starting everyday.
6816	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of air this fan moves on such a low energy drain.  For me, the noise is not as bad as some say it is and is not a problem as I like to sleep with a fan going.  The white noise is peaceful.
4630	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	You need this. Seriously. M39 first to remove the dirt, M40 to make it look like new! I have spent a lot of money trying to find stuff that works and this works better than everything else I've tried.
3795	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	It's smaller than I expected. It funnels as it was designed to.
5566	Automotive_5	NEG	2.0	bad
6453	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	ok
3094	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	First time ever using rain-x. I've been amazed at how easy the rain and water slides off. I like having crystal clear glass and was afraid this might leave some residue but I've been pleasantly surprised at how clean it has stayed.
Anyhow, I have two sets of keys and they will not work on each other.  I mixed them up several times and was happy to see I could not use the incorrect key to open.

-Bearing Grease Packer (or you can just use your hands and some rubber gloves)..messy!
4179	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	i guess
7624	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Perfect for my 05 Merc 115 Saltwater 4 stroke.
- The unit is easy to put together. A 5 year old could do it and it does not require any tools.
7012	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Quality item  works well
3456	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	WORKS!
8152	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
Tested it at more than 400ft unobstructed, signal is capable. From inside the building to the parking lot- it didnt. Overall, I AM SATISFIED with this starter.
The new motor quality appears far superior to the original I replaced.  Also, it has sealed bearings and brushless in design.  I am not sure of the Lomanco model having these features but I am guessing it doesn't.  Regardless, the Lomanco model died in just a few years and quality motors typically last 20 years.
413	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Love the looks I get....fits in with my attitude most days.
7120	Automotive_5	POS	5.0	Essential product for my truck bed camper, will run overnight on my camper battery, quiet and moves plenty of air.
5979	Automotive_5	POS	4.0	Great piece of gear for someone that wants to keep their expensive propellers away from thieves, or at least make their life a little harder when comes to robbing you!
