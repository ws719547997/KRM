- If you will ever need to use your miter stand outside on soft (but close to level) ground, consider getting one with large tires that stay down when the table is opened up (Trojan MS2000, Rousseau 2950, or Delta 36-136).  Stands that rest on 4 legs when opened (HTC HP-575PK or Delta 50-155) might sink into a soft surface (such as grass) when setting it up - OR - tip over once set up.  With the Trojan, you won't need a piece of wood under the tires for increased stability.  If the ground isn't level, prop up one tire and one side of the other end for firm base, with a small piece of plywood or other scrap.

6026	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Nice product overall. One little issue with it is that it has the fit adjustment screws only on one end and one side. (not to be confused with the height adjustment screws - which are fine)  This means when you adjust it for a tight fit it pushes the insert against just one side and one end. I have a DW744 (Dewalt) table saw and the cutout for the insert is a little rough on the sides. The insert rides up a little as you push it sideways with the one screw. I had to grind off some of the rough casting areas on my table top with a Dremel tool to get a snug fit. It just irks me when manufacturers settle for "good enough" when they could approach perfection so easily. It would be a simple fix to put a screw on both sides and both ends for fit adjustment (for us who live in a less then perfect world).

2265	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I've seen some off-shore poor-quality product sold by Delta in the past - I know it's what you need to do to compete in this market, but this out-feed table is the worst.  Besides the enormous amount of time that it takes to install, adjust, re-adjust etc, the quality of the table and laminate is garbage.  The shipping from Amazon left minor damage around the edges.  Laminate peeling, cracked, etc - but parts missing is no excuse.  I knew that my options were to return it or exchange from Amazon, so I decided to call Delta directly who told me it would be several months until the new part was released and on top of all that - I had to pay for it.  When they sent me to the warranty call center, they simply sent me back to the general info number.  I can now see that Delta is no different than any of the off-shore clone woodworking products that are out there.  You are for sure better off building your own in this case.  It's not close to the quality of the machine that it couples up with, in my case an older Unisaw.  Sorry Delta!
.light spread could be a little wider...  gets dim towards the edges of pages.
The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.  Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.  This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.

2731	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	DeWalt tools are not great, to reveal my bias up-front. This one, however, is especially bad. The fence is a piece of stamped steel that is not very precise. Two plastic (ABS, I think, not even nylon) rectangles cover the fence and then a shoddily cast alignment mechanism sits off the back end. The alignment mechanism can rotate about 10 degrees in either direction along the stamped steel fence (not intentionally, either, it just sucks and is imprecise) and there is a lot of slop in the whole design.
5323	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great!
The crank mechanism is so tight that the clutch usually slips before the jaws have closed, making the one-handed tightening feature (surely the most attractive feature of the model) useless. I have spent some time trying to overcome this by lubricating the crank screw and bearings to no real effect. The design of the clutch (a cross-pin engaging in a rounded sawtooth pawl) means that continual slippage can cause minor damage that makes it that much more likely to slip in the future.

3793	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Overall I'm satisfied with this saw for the price.  It does two things most circular saws can't: cuts a 60 degree bevel in 2x's, and cuts 6x's in 2 passes.  The power, stability, and lack of run-out/wobble in this saw make for very nice cuts.  It's a brute to handle, but so are 7 1/4" worm saws.

5989	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	There is a sticker on the insert that states it is compatible with the Dewalt DWE7491RS 10" table saw. Well maybe. If you want to use your riving knife for this model saw, you have to cut all the way through to the end of the insert. Which means you have to lift the insert by the finger hole and drag it through the blade. Although it does fit in the saw opening, I cannot get it to adjust such that it fits flush with the saw table top. There just isn't enough adjustment screw length. Overall I'm very disappointed with this insert for this model saw. Another issue is the lack of locking mechanism like the factory inserts. It probably would not be a problem if the insert fit flush in the opening but on my saw it will wobble because the friction mechanism on the side of the insert is enough to hold it in place.
could use longer hold-down stud for better or at least more situations.

The table arrived and packaging was adequate.  Comes in the Benchdog manufacturer's box, not packaged by amazon.  No problems whatsoever with the condition it arrived in.
Before anyone thinks these are wrong for a table saw because the green wheels rotate in both directions, the wheels are only a different color, and it is the bearing inside that dictates which direction they will rotate, either clockwise, counter clockwise or both. I don't have kickback issues, but rather want to ensure the wood stays against the fence. Perhaps these WOULD BE great, but since the T-Nuts are defective, who knows?

I have a Delta Dust Collection System, and use it for the dust collection. I have found that most shop vacs will be hard pressed to offer very good dust collection on a router. They may work well for the fence port in some instances, but they do not work at all for the main body collection (all of the saw dust and debris that falls UNDER the router when using a table). This part takes some volume, and suction power to work well.

4253	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Purchased the Freud 8" dado and it worked as well as this one, however even though my Bosch 4100 table saw is adequate for that size,  after a couple of cuts I traded it in, came to Amazon and am pleased with this 6" preferring it much better. I simply did not like the sound my motor made pushing the heavier 8" body and noticed it even more after using this 6". I am enamored with my Bosch and plan to have it around a good long time, so why strain it. I am a hobbyist in the garage and see that this product does all I need to have done. It is a far cry from my Craftsman spin dado. Clean cuts, square corners, the whole enchilada. Though the documentation is sparse and even in error for some of the settings (IMO) working it with practice cuts pays off well.
3617	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I have a number of other Makita tools, and have always held Makita in pretty high regard.  My 7 1/4" circular saw works great, as does my motorized hand planer, Reciprocating saw, and my plunge router is awsome.  This machine seems more like a toy that a quality piece of machinery. I was surprised to see a little bit of play when the saw was moved into one of the 45 notches. I could pretty easily move it one degrees side to side, unless it was absolutely locked down, and then it was not consistent about being locked down in the same place. When I got the left-hand miter perfect at 45 I could not get the right hand side at 45, and this is a real problem as they share the same fence. I'm not sure if the notch was machined in the wrong spot or what, but it's impossible to cut perfect mitered corners this way.
I did a short overview of what was available and still couldn't find anything I liked better,,so, in '04 I bought another one. This time though the saw has been upgraded to 15 amps from the previous 13 amps, and I couldn't be happier. 10 or 11 years from now if this one goes out again, I'll buy another one gladly. The smoothest running, straightest cutting, easiest to control saw I've ever seen has no competition. Well,,, maybe the 8  1/4 inch version of the same saw.

The one-piece design inspires confidence that I won't see the head of this baby go flying by my head on the back swing.  If my mind were to wander to thoughts of lunch, I know that a misplaced blow won't pulverize some wooden handle or worse, send slivers of fiberglass into my eye. All metal construction, sufficient mass, and quality craftsmanship combine in an exceptional all-purpose hammer.
  Update, 1/20/06.....  I was fooled....  I spent $95 for a high precision CNC square, which is checked for accuracy to .05 Degrees.  This was my new benchmark to test the Bosch, and I was much surprised to see it read 89.9 Degrees, making it well within its specification range of .1 degrees.  This demonstrates you only get what you pay for, and not all squares are square, even though you spend good money for them.  Now, the Bosch is quite the tool, and very accurate, which is critical for me.



5643	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I don't have a traditional workshop/garage - I have to take my tools out of a storage shed to use them, however I still like to do high quality woodworking and cabinetry - so I was in the market for a top quality bench top router table. After researching for many, many hours over several weeks and hands on examining several models, I decided on the BenchDog ProTop Contractor.  I wanted a very solid/durable high quality table with full size table features; namely it had to have the ability to mount a router lift and the fence had to be top notch, I went and looked at all the competition and narrowed it down to the BenchDog and the Kreg, in the end I preferred the BenchDog fence & enclosed wooden cabinet better.
4801	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A step backward for Makita. My 30 year old 4x24 had a flat top which could be placed on my workbench upside-down and be stable; not so with this new design.

If installed properly, this product works well, and does what it's supposed to do.
  I also bought the Forrest II blade when I read the reviews in this months Fine Woodworking magazine, they rated it as number one, and Frued was number 2. The top 1 and 2 out of all of the blades, not bad.  Fine Woodworking mentioned that their wasn't any tear out. Well I got those same exact results with the Freud. No tear out at all. The magazine rated the Freud as excellent in smooth cut, but only very good in tear outs. My experience is that when ripping 3/4" material, this blade produced a smooth cut without any saw marks. Nice enough to mount as an exposed edge on your project. Of course, a true fence is critical.
Note: Being advertised as 'quiet' at 84dB is pretty relative since >90dB for sustained periods will deafen... hearing loss is cummulative over time around high dB power tools (routers, table and miter saws, plate joiners, etc.) even if rated under the 90dB threshold... wear ear protection [Check out Peltor H10A Professional Earmuff Hearing Protectors].

It's got a little more bend than I expected, but I suppose I should have anticipated that given that it's a double edged saw with a very fine cut. Works well if you know how to use it and let it do all the work. Very sharp out of the box, so nearly any pressure added and it will snag. The weight of the blade is all that's needed to make a nice fine cut at surprising speeds.

Even in a router table, you need 15A only if you're routinely spinning bits larger than about 2", which are mostly horizontal panel-raisers. A 12A router is fine for most router table use. A 12A router won't last as long if you're using large bits, however.

The only caveat is that I find it a little annoying to put the two pieces of the attachment back together, fitting just right. Considering that the multiple piece design is intentional so that you can re-sharpen the chain blade, it's definitely not a deal breaker in my opinion.

2478	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works exclusively with Dewalt Scroll saw. I move the saw around a lot in my garage shop and with the wheels I added, works well. I was worried that it might not be sufficiently stable, but that doesn't seem to be a big problem. I mounted a terminal strip to the backside so that I could plug in the lamp and foot switch. 4 stars instead of 5 because a four wheel version would be more stable.
  Upon inspection I found that the plastic accessory tray was cracked and that the splitter assembly was nowhere to be found.  It's probably on a UPS loading dock somewhere.


5845	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great
6350	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A set of tools to assure a good job becomes a great one.  The price is expensive though for a specialized clamp. That is why only four stars out of five.

1. The enclosed manual was for Bench Dog's Pro Cabinet (a much different item). It took a couple of seconds of scratching my head in search of the parts described in step 1 of the assembly instructions before I bothered to glance at the front of the manual. I had to download and print the correct manual from the manufacturer website.
6816	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like the light weight of this pipe wrench.  The tool is plenty strong.

8819	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I suspect that if you are reading this review, it's because you are trying to justify spending 100+ USD on a square.  Believe me, I did the same thing.  But, after going ahead and biting the bullet, I'm very pleased with the purchase.  It may sound weird to say, but the tool is just lovely.  The surfaces are machined perfectly and it's dead-on square.  Final bonus?  Made in the USA.  You can buy a crappy square made in China and be frustrated with the results, or buy an American made product and have it for the rest of your life (and then pass it on to your son or daughter).
I was hesitant to purchase because the price seemed too good but my first bulb is still burning fine after several months of use.

4426	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works great
6538	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is really an excellent clamp. It can be adjusted so that each flat inner face of the clamp sits perfectly flat against the work being clamped. Very strong clam. I really like it.
9045	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	What is there to say about a battery? It takes a charge and it delivers power. This particular model lasts a very long time. The impulse guns must not require much power to operate because these will drive several thousand nails before dying. My only complaint is that they are expensive compared to other batteries . At the same rate a 12v would be a hundred bucks.
for larger ones... use power tools.

2595	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Another excellent tool from Milwaukee. The adjustable handle is a very nice touch. It is not too heavy, but is still very rugged. The base was dead flat. Switching blades is a snap.
1982	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	good.
1346	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	great bulbs for the RV and very conveniently delivered...  the closest RV store is 150 miles away right now

OVERALL IMPRESSION:
1377	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Exactly as advertised and MUCH cheaper than the $5 and $6 (each!) that the big box stores charge.  Just get it!

Mounting my new Porter-Cable 892 Router was easy enough, but one thing was strange:  Porter makes an Extension Handle to allow motor lock/release and height adjustment from above the table.  But, SURPRISE:  They forgot to place the 2 holes in the table top for the adjustments!  They only have holes for another model.  (Mine IS a current model Porter Cable router, so this was a surprise...)  When I called them, they said I can drill out the two holes.  They sent me a paper template and even threw in the Handle for my trouble.  Actually, I have gotten used to reaching in below and I have gotten pretty fast at opening the lever, turning the ht. knob, and closing the lever again.  So I am not sure I will drill the holes...
9370	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	looks good and came fast

4677	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Fits perfectly on my Mitre Saw
3596	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Well worth the price. If you don't put up crown molding alot, this will make the job a little easier.
5847	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	There are enough glowing reviews of this product already, and I agree that this is an excellent quality product. I have nothing but praise for the quality and value of this table. I bought it for the portability factor for jobsite use.  I got mine from a retail vendor and not amazon. So I paid a bit more but was glad I was able to walk out of the store with it and not have to wait for amazon to ship.
4119	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are fantastic. Just made 8 deep drawers for our kitchen using this blade for the dados.
I think this tool has saved my wrist, and it's a "must have" for any job which requires assembly, cabinet hinges, electrical work, and it will drive surprisingly large wood screws too. 5 stars for simple, logical, robust design (9 planetary gears), and it's small size is just right to get into tight places. Thank god it doesn't have rubberized racing stripes stuck all over it!
9803	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The advantage to this Goodyear hose is that it is made out of industrial grade rubber instead of vinyl. What that means is that when you are using it instead of being stiff like vinyl it remains soft and flexible, so it lays flat on the floor. This is especially a problem in colder temperatures. It's great for coiling as well, it doesn't fight you.
5012	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	This was what came with my DeWalt miter saw, and I lost in a move to our house. It is too small and but unless you have a dust collection system this will do in a pinch.

8278	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very good hammer.
We have also heard of a few saws on the market that have an interference problem with the inside blade. To check this disconnect power to the saw, and with a blade on the saw look down inside the saw beside the blade. If there is anything like belts or structural members closer than 1/2" from the sides of the blade then this could be a problem. If there is any question after this visual inspection the take an old saw blade (can be a 10" or a 7 1/4" as long as they have the same arbor as the saw) and on the side opposite the arbor nut hot glue 6 US Pennies in a stack about 1 1/2" from the center of the arbor. Put the blade on the saw (still with the saw disconnected) and rotate the blade using the arbor wrench.  If the pennies do not contact anything then you should not have an interference problem."
8159	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love it.
2408	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Used this tool once so far to see how it worked. I made a dado using the factory edge of a piece of plywood and this thing made the cut even and clean. Very pleased
5393	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	does the job
I tried lining the can with a trash bag, but it does not work. The vacuum brings the trash bag/liner up to the vac hole and clogs it. Without the trash bag, the smooth sides of the galvanized can allow the large chips to slide easily out and into the bag lined, larger can.
464	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased 2 of these and am very happy with them. They are great for reading in bed....or clamping on the work bench by my vise for when I need a little extra light on my work projects. It's just a great little light. Works great and puts out a decent amount of light. Also...they are nice in the car for when you want an adjustable "map" lamp.
6183	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Does the Job...
If I were going to use a WorkMate as a permanent base for a chop saw or a router bench, I might get the heavy one, but as a portable workbench, which is where this tool shines, the small one costs less and is more practical, IMHO.

PS  The arm doesn't stay up when removing your work piece but there are scrollsaw websites that sell remedies for that. Really easy to find. They are small home engineers who came up with solutions. The Lifter is one I purchased
4411	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What can I say, a saw blade is a saw blade.  Works flawlessly.  I'd purchase again when needed.
4181	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Horrible CS. I have bought from amazon for years but Timberline made some excuse about a price error and it was the price for one chipper blade only, blamed it on amazon and would not honor the sale. Amazon would not do anything to help on 3rd party sales. Amazon is usually very good on honoring their own prices, even if it was an error and the order was placed with them. Not so with Timberline.
8510	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Really nice level with excellent accuracy.
7002	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought 3 and they all work the same (nice), however I thought they were a little stiff. It is nice to have the additional reach and it's nice to have the additional pressure. Overall they work very well.
8042	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a cool tool!  Pretty, too.

4893	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This tool does a great job doing what it is designed to do.  It makes nice, clean, consistent biscuit joints.

Accessories included in the package are:
2228	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great light, and the stiff neck extention is an added help.
7811	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I needed a workbench in a pinch as I hadn't built mine yet and this received adequate reviews. After a couple months of using it, I should've waited. Putting it together wasn't too bad. The only tricky part was the the "vise" where it was tough to get the plastic lined up with the gear shaft. It's hard to clamp things to it because of all the over hanging metal. You can't clamp things to two entire sides because something gets in the way. It seems sturdy but at certain angles it's tippy. For example, on the box cover, there is a picture of a door being held by the table. For kicks, I tried this with a door sitting in my basement and it immediately fell over. I tried it with a 2x2 birch plywood and the same thing while it didn't fall over, a very small bit of pressure on the end (where, for example, I'd want to route the edge) made it tippy. There's no way I'd want to do any power tool work on this as I just don't trust it to stay stable. Nevermind getting a clean cut -- I'm talking about cutting myself.

5370	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Make sure you have extra wheels if you dull many bits
2948	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Nice, but not their snake light.  The Dewalt snake light is much more useful.  Yet, this is cheaper and there are uses so having it around is a good thing.
June 2010 - Gave it away, with a disclaimer to the new owner.
7341	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Jorgensen Pony pipe clamps are great for pipe clamps, durable and smooth in operation. Easy release on tail end, nice handle on crank end. Just remember, these are just pipe clamps. Great pressure, small area, not parallel faces, just close to it. RECOMMENDED for woodworkers in shop.
Enough said.  Buy it!!  For around $35.00 you can't, CAN'T go wrong.  A Forrest Woodworker of this quality will cost you nearly THREE TIMES as much.
Several people have complained about losing the ability to use their splitter with this insert.  I noted in the instructions that if you are installing this on a DW746 saw, all you need to do is bandsaw a small kerf in the rear edge of the plate (in line with the table saw blade kerf) and you will have a slot to mount your splitter through.  This should not be too difficult to accomplish for a woodworker...
8433	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This dado stack has been very nice to use. The cut quality has been pretty good. The bottoms of the dados generaly don't need much, if any, clean up. The tear out is also very minimal. The directions on the back for calculating which blades to use were a little difficult to interpret at first, but once I got the gist it became extremely helpful. I would recommend this product as a nicely priced, high quality dado stack.
9061	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	seems to cut nicely
7190	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this bit to replace one I purchased nearly 20 years ago.  It withstood some pretty handling over the years before it began to show signs of wear.  It did not fail on me it probably still has some heavy work left in it.  I just wanted to make sure I got a replacement before I needed it.  I was afraid I would find out that they were no longer made by the original manufacturer and that I would have to settle for some cheap knock-off.  I was surprised to find it still available in its original form.  The new bit is every bit as good as the original.
- relatively long, flexible arm
6106	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Found the required can at the local hardware store.  I modified the inlets with 4 inch PCV pipe.  The Woodstock W1019 4 inch splices fit right inside and are more snug than coiling the 4 inch hose into the opening.  Love this pre-collector now!

2071	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very heavy and solidly made. Soft-start feature is wonderful and should be standard on almost any woodworking tool with an electric motor. Handles are metal! Speed control is nice, but the speed selection switch can be moved with the lightest of touch, should have firmer detents. You have to be careful when selecting the speed because the switch moves so easily. Power switch is not sealed like some of the other PC routers and is hard to find when the router is mounted in a table. Comes with 1/2" collet, should include 1/4" collet as well, although a 1/4" collet from any other PC router will fit. Otherwise, stock up on the 1/2" shank bits. Works wonderfully in a router table, in my shop its only usage will be with the table, it is too big and heavy to use for most non-table activities. Sure wish that PC would come up with a different collet design that does not rely on two wrenches to mount or dismount a bit. Perhaps a design that uses an Allen-type wrench or even a tool-free design. The collets work fine, I just find it inconvenient to have to use two wrenches to tighten or loosen them. Wish it had the lever-release for the height-adjustment like the PC690LR and that the handles could be removed from the base for use in a table. Has ample power and while I have a few quibbles about some of its other points, this is a fine router and should be your first choice for use in a router table. In fact, don't waste your time and money on a smaller router for table use.
3281	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	For Makita owners, I can confirm that this bulb does work in the Makita 18V flashlight, and it seems just as bright as the original Makita bulb.
1818	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Update (2014): I still have two of these. They sit more than they get used. They are top notch tools of the highest quality. No changes to add to the review below. Just letting you know that the tools and myself are still valid and this tool is still available new.
7876	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This truly amazing tool has become my most used (and cherished) handtool.  For delicate interior work, it is perfect for removing brads and small nails.  You can easily avoid wood dings and mars by placing a solid plate (or the end of a second identical tool) under the pry head.  The flat end gives you a very thin (and sharp! be careful) edge which allows you to wedge in between moulding and trim and pull them apart.  It's not for demolition work, like a wonderbar, but I find more uses than I could ever have imagined for this fine, precision tool.  I bought an extra one for my neighbor, and he has come to same conclusion regarding its usefulness.  Don't leave home on a job without it!
1298	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Nice price, fits with IKEA under cabinet puck lights
2268	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I modified this Delta outfeed table to fit my Sawstop tablesaw.  I took some work but its well worth it.  The small stationary support has rabbets to clear the miter slide and because its always in place its very handy for pieces less than 48".  The flip up/down extension is great for safely and accurately ripping long boards and sheet goods.  This outfeed is an excellent buy for a small shop when you consider just the cost of the hardware.  I'm not sure way so many have received them with broken pieces.  Mine was packed well and received in perfect condition.  Maybe Delta improved the packing.
The first pic show my jig setup. The second pic shows two 1/4" end mill touch offs. The lower mark was purposely off center. I ruler measured it and found it to be a bit over 5/32" off center so I moved the fence just over 4 turns (the way I calc'd it was 4.17 turns). I was pleasantly surprised to see it moved about 4.2mm and I hit the center line as close as I need it to be for making my mortises. One measurement, one adjustment is fantastic!
1265	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Extra bulbs for the lamp, just in case

5016	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this drill 3 years ago to help cut holes in the studs on my living room wall to run HDMI, stereo wire and cat6.  It cut through those boards like butter - even at a terrible angle it works like a charm.  Everything about this tool is top of the line - great case, great documentation, great durability.  I see the price hasn't really gone down so I guess I should be happy about that!  Either way, this is a powerful drill that will really get where you need to go.
1855	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Porter Cable Router along with the Porter Cable Edge Guide.  Once I had it, I took it to my brother-in-law to give me a practical demonstration of its capabilities. He is a contractor who does a lot of cabinet work. He was VERY impressed with both the router and the edge guide. He has worked with a lot of different routers over the years and he was extremely impressed with this edge guide.
It is probably a great drill and someday I may actually use it as one, but meanwhile it's an outstanding sanding tool and I highly recommend it.
5886	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a terrible black & Decker Jig that wants to turn to the left constantly, my boss had these blades and they amazed me with how well they cut and how easy they were to maneuver, so I thought I would buy some and see how they worked in mine. I can now say I no longer feel like I could cut a curvy line better with my skilsaw than with my Jig.
1925	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Got this to use with the Rockwell RK3441K circular saw.  Works great, sliced up a bunch of 1/2" and 3/4" birch plywood with it already.  Nice thin kerf.
1914	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Everything came in in great time and was packaged very well. The price on it was great also. Just as listed.
One thing I like about this is that it can rest on its own clip, like a stand.  This is great for when I want to play on my laptop in a dark hotel room and still want to see the keyboard.  I don't have to clip it to anything - just stand it up and turn it on.  Bonus!

5881	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This table works well in my small shop.  The base extends far enough for me to clamp the router table to a work surface, yet I can store the entire system on a shelf when not in use.  I use a Porter Cable 690, which seems to work well in this table.  In addition to the "nits" other reviewers mentioned, I find the interior fills with sawdust even when I use the fence-mounted vacuum hookup.  I'll be drilling the back of the box for a second dust port to keep the inside clean and adding an external power switch.
5661	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I looked at many portable router tables and decided on the Bench Dog and I sure am glad I did!!  Easy to assemble and quality material!
1)  A quality built tool with thoughtful design.  You'll read some complaints on the dust collection bag but I find that it works about as well as most out there.  If you're really concerned with dust, hooking up a shop-vac should do the trick.
2182	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Dewalt bulbs are the best out there.  They are brighter than other flashlight bulbs yet are very tough and can withstand being dropped while on.  I don't have a Dewalt flashlight but I use them in my Porter Cable and Bosch flashlights and they out perform the bulbs than came with those flashlights.  I highly recommend these bulbs you won't be disappointed.

8971	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these hoses for years (with the Goodyear badging) and they are the best I've used.  They stay flexible in cold weather, don't crack, and coil up better than other hoses I've had.  Since Continental bought the whole business, including the manufacturing facility, I'm expecting the one I just bought to be the same quality as my Goodyears.
When installing, you might have to increase the relief on the bottom; my blade was all the way down and made contact after only 1/4 turn but I didn't have to increase the relief.



Ok, after owning this for a while I am knocking off a couple of stars.
6022	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	It worked perfectly on my table saw and allowed me to cut thinner strips as it no longer had the big gap along the blade. When I installed it I noticed that the trap was clogged with chunks of wood that had fallen through with the Dewalt insert.
4610	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	works great, cuts into wood with ease, and is very adjustable.  I learned along time ago, but a quality tool from the start.
 The blade tension adjustment is also way better than on the other saws I've tried out. It's a little lever right there on the end of the upper arm and you only have to move it about a quarter of a turn to release the tension. Best of all it has markings to line it up with and I can feel it sliding over little notches as I turn it so when I find a tension that works good on a blade I can get the same tension every time I re-clamp the blade when moving it to another inside cut. The main thing you have to remember is you cant lift and carry the saw by the upper arm.



4572	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought it, I put it on, it works and I haven't thought of it since.  I have a few months of use on it now and I am happy that I bought it.  I don't have another bandsaw rip fence to compare it to, but I don't need anything else.

In summary, this is a very solid, well-built router table.  It is a little pricey ..., but you get what you pay for, and I have no regrets.  ...

9956	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product. I have been building decks for about 32 years and this gem makes the work much easier. If the deck board is bowed or curved, then just use this bow wrench and fix it. It is that easy. Great product!
This machine is quieter then my old belt sander and the bigger shoe makes for better surfacing.
  The problem is trying to rout out the opening, at precisely the proper depth, so the plate is perfectly flush with the top. A little too deep and you have a valley. A little proud, and you have a ridge to run into, and run the risk of your workpiece coming to a halt. So what to do? Rout out a 1/16" or 1/8" deeper than is necessary. Then drill holes a little smaller than the melamine screw size all around the outside lip. Since melamine screws are not tapered, the threads are the same size for the full length of the shaft. You can look up melamine screws here at Amazon with a search. They refer you to McFeeleys, which is a great business, with instant service, and a full array of screws and fasteners. Much more variety than the usual home centers. They have a box of 50 available. Ok so what is the big deal about using the melamine screws? This is it, by using the screws with the flat tips, screwed in from underneath, all around the circumference, you wind up with a fine adjust system for getting the Rousseau plate, perfectly level with the table top. Combining that with the four countersunk holes in each of the corners for securing the top, you get an incredibly adjustable platform for the Rousseau top. I used 14 melamine screws, equally balanced around the circumference. It enabled me to fine adjust the plate so well, that I was able to completely eliminate the ever so slight crown in the plate. Although I did attach it to a wide base plunge router, which I am sure contributed to the leveling.

All of the bulbs of this type seem to be imports, so why pay for the name-brand mark-up?
So-So:
Since I was changing from a 1/4" blade, I had to reset all my guides, tracking and tension.  The upper blade support was about 1/4" above the surface of the plastic. I've been doing this for 25+ years so I know how to set up a saw for a particular blade.
9516	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to use with my Dewalt Compact Hammerdrill/Driver. I also have their Compact Impact Driver, and love the easy, quick bit changes. This gives me the same quick-change ability for non-impact driving. I also bought the N131745 bit holder, which mounts at the base of the handle in place of the belt clip, and store it there, so I never have to go looking for it. It's a great combination, makes my drill/driver much more versatile!
584	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like the light.  It is easy to handle and it sheds the right amount of light on the kindle screen without a glare.  It also has two settings that make it even nicer to use.
8093	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I needed to install 12 stairs using an inch thick 5000+ janka bamboo, which is extremely expensive for each piece of both tread and riser.  The stairs I needed to install on are not square, again neither the tread nor the riser.  Not off by a huge amount, but by 0.5 to 2 degrees on each end.  Enough that it would look like garbage if I cut square.  I had the tool out of the package and setup, and read the little guide in less than 10 minutes, and got straight to work measuring.  This tool is outstanding.  As other reviewers have said you can make tools yourself, or take a few measurements/make a template with card stock, but I figured I'd give this tool a try and am extremely satisfied.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is making stairs, especially when each mistake no matter how small is going to cost $100+.



The only time I  ever injured myself during a ripping operation was when I failed to set up  the rollers because I was "just making a quick cut" (Fortunately,  I still have all my fingers and thumbs -- knock-on-wood.)

It has the power and durability for more work than I want to do.  It was a little more expensive than some others, but I have never been sorry to have bought a Dewalt product.  Quality costs nothing.
257	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This thing is great! I don't normally use book lights because I don't like them, but I tried it one night and now I'm using it regularly. The light is evenly distirbuted, and just wide enough to cover both pages of a hardback book, and the gooseneck stays where I put it. It's not heavy enough to cause problems.

6330	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This part worked dwell to make the transition from my Dewalt table saws' double dust collector ports.
My saw is used primarily in a shop environment and mainly as a replacement for a radial arm saw (cross-cuts 8/4 hard maple like a hot knife through soft butter), honestly I cannot imagine working without it.  I had heard from other trades that the saw "goes out of adjustment frequently" and I must admit I have had this problem on job sites.  The primary issue is the saws weight and awkwardness in moving it around.  The four screws used to secure the adjustable platen to the saw base do loosen up with use and just picking this Mother up can effect the saws precision.  The good news is it's not a major ordeal to re-set the alignment and a little bit of lock-tite prevents the set screws from wiggling loose.  Although the saw can be placed on a work-mate (barely), I would recommend the DeWalt stand (the adjustable material supports alone make it worth the money).  And if DeWalt would just put adjustable legs or feet on this stand it would be a perfect solution both in the shop and on-site.  Yes the saw throws dust everywhere (which is more of a problem in a client's house than in the shop or outside), but a vacuum hook-up greatly helps and in reality every mitre saw does the same.

It's a very specific product, but one with a ton of uses.  If you've never used a recip saw before, I would caution you to always make sure your item being cut is safely secured; a recip saw of this size has enough strength to easily move anything that is loosely held.  Always be sure of what's under or behind the blade; if it's a concrete driveway or asphalt, you can damage the tool, but REALLY damage the driveway!  Wear boots and safety goggles, this thing takes NO prisoners.  And for heaven's sake, if you're demo'ing a wall, make absolutely certain that there are no live electrical wires present.

Some people think the magnetic holders protect their knuckles from errant hammer blows. That's also unnecessary. Those people are usually holding the nail wrong: knuckles up, between thumb and forefinger. Every pro-carpenter I know holds nails knuckles DOWN between two other fingers. That allows them to place the nail accurately, and strike it with enough authority to set it, but there is little risk of hurting fingers.

Parallel blade adjustment.
I'm using a pair of the MSI-PRO  clamps to attach a sacrificial fence to the Biesemeyer fence on my Delta Unisaw.  I recently added a router table to this saw, so I'm using the fence for the router as well, and router fences often need to be milled or split, something that's not recommended for the Biesemeyer.
The worst part about putting it together is the instructions that come in the box.  They are somewhat vague, and the illustrations in the instruction sheets are black & white photos that are VERY blurry.  And, the photos were taken too far away from the stand to be of much use - it would help a LOT if Delta would provide clear, close-up, detailed photos.  I got SOME help by studying the color photos on the box, but again, those photos weren't close-enough to see the details I needed to see.  The other negative is that there were no lock-washers for the bolts that shoulder the weight of the tool that's on top of the base - and the bolts provided were barely long enough to fully thread the nuts onto.  Going to have to keep an eye on those nuts to make sure they're not backing-off...

Recently I built a cnc router for a my cabinets and other projects I have.  This is the router I put on it.  It is a workhorse.  Runs for a full 8+ hours and never stops.  Sure a spindle and VFD would be nicer but a $30 pair of earmuffs is worth the enormous price difference.  I would recommend this router to anyone.  Only recommendation is to buy good bits.  You get what you pay for and this router can and will overheat regular steel bits if you are not careful.  I run only solid carbide on mine.  I would agree that this is the closest thing to a shaper that you can buy on the consumer based products.  Great price for a great product although please wear hearing protection.

2673	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had been looking for quite awhile for a VS scroll saw, they were either way to pricey or a piece of just junk. I came across this model while I was in a local Woodcraft store. I really don't have any grips about this saw ( which is very surprising for me because I hate almost everything made by DeWalt today) but this saw is a really nice saw.......except.........for the accessory light made for this saw by DeWalt, it is a piece of JUNK! Amazon sent the 1st light to me with saw. After attaching light gravity takes over after a few seconds and light makes a nosedive for the saws tabletop. This seems to be a very common problem with the light for this saw and DeWalt has known about this problem since like 2009 and refuses to fix the problem. I called Amazon, as usual Amazon CS is top notch, they sent me another one the very same day and it was overnighted to me! Amazon CS rocks. The second light does the exact same thing, so I boxed it back up went to IKEA and purchased a 15.00 light with a clamp and magnetic base and problem is fixed! Its a shame  DeWalt and Porter Cable are being run by the likes of Black and Decker! 99% of the tools coming out of their factories now are junk and marketed for the DIY'ers and Weekend Warriors that don't care about quality when it comes to a tool purchase, all they care about is price point. Sorry about the rant, but this saw is better than most anything else DeWalt is building today...Almost makes me wonder who is building it for DeWalt?

I work on a large crew of woodworkers and we have every saw ever used on the job. I have used them all. What sets the DeWalt apart is the large capacity and ease of use.  The saw did need calibration out of the box.  There are three nuts to calibrate the 0, 45 degree left  and 45 degree right stops.  After some fine adjustments it has been cutting perfect miters for years.  The fence was not perfectly square with the blade at first.  I calibrated the fence by removing it and filing the bolt holes to slot them a little with a rat tail file.  Since the first calibration it has performed flawlessly. The dust collection is make believe.

I like this light so much I bought a couple of extras for Xmas gifts, and the recipients love them like I do.  5 stars!
When it finally arrived, I had a couple concerns. The handles feel a touch cheap. In fact my right handle seems split along the plastic seam giving it just a touch of slidey action. I also noticed that the depth of cut adjustment pushes the plastic above the indicator out when you push a little too far rather than simply locking properly. There's also a cap that rattles around on the plunge rod unless it's held upright. I thought something was busted and loose inside of it at first.

place to trust your scroll saw. there are also holes in the base of the legs to bolt it to the floor if you'd like.
- Relatively lightweight (batteries are heaviest part)
I've used it with Porter-Cable 690 and 890 series routers and it is a cut above the old style with two rods.  It also works with the plunge base of the Dewalt 611 trim router.
The bits are actually driven by the drill via a quick disconnect adapter. You chuck up the adapter and then hook up to the bits, both of which have to mounted into the jig before you mount the jig onto the door. Get the adapter with the 1/2" shaft. The 3/8" shaft can do the job but there is a lot of torque cutting a 2-1/8" lock bore and the 3/8" adapter shaft can bend. The 1/2" adapter shaft is very stout.
9630	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good tool. Like the way it ejects bits.
It took about 20 min to install. Once it's operational, I made a few test cuts, and then spend the next hour fine tuning it. It is now perfectly square and pararllel to the blade.

I used 1 & 1/4 inch metal electrical conduit (it is 1 & 1/2" across the walls of the conduit). Worked perfectly - very strong and stable. $5.60 at the local hardware store for a 10' length of conduit, which was more than enough for the job.
  At first I hesitated because Incra who makes my TSIII-32 table saw fence said that board buddies are not compatible with the Incra fence. Knowing the engineering principles involved with the board buddies, and Amazon's generous return policy, I decided to go ahead and order them. I'm glad I did.

3695	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I had a Porter Cable 19.2 volt drill with a light but evetually my batteries went bad so I bought a Milwaukee 18 volt hammer drill/saw combo. I missed having the flashlight so I bought the Milwaukee light to go with my batteries. I like this light even better than the Porter Cable becuse the on/off switch is so much easier to use especially with gloves on. I highly recommend the light to anyone who had Milwaukee cordless tools because it is well built and very bright. The battery provides a stable base for it to sit on and the pivoting head makes it easy to shine the light where you need it. It is another great tool from Milwaukee.
2973	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I scroll saw wooden trivets from 3/4" red oak.  In 2000 I made almost 1,000. I spend a lot of time at my saw. All of the cuts I make are inside cuts so ease of blade changing is very important. I have owned a Hegner and two Excaliburs before buying the DeWalt in December 1999. The DeWalt costs 1/3 what the Hegner and Excalibur cost. Hegner is by far the hardest of the three brands to change blades and customer support is poor. DeWalt worked with Somerville Designs (the maker of the Excalibur) to design the DeWalt saw. The Excaliburs I have, one 20" and one 30" saw were good but required routine oiling replacement of the many sleeve bearings. Customer support through Seyco was excellant. When the Excaliburs were getting to the point that repairs were going to cost what a new DeWalt cost I decided to try the DeWalt. I have found the saw to be every bit as good as the Excalibur. All of the sleeve bearings in the Excalibur have been replaced with roller bearings which do not require any maintenance. The blade holders are a much better design, they have required no maintenance during the year of use. The Excalibur blade holders would need to be rebuilt and replaced several times a year. The Excalibur tables were made from aluminum and remained slippery, an important feature for a scroll saw. The DeWalt uses a cast table and the surface wears away around the blade hole causing work to drag on the table. DeWalt says this is caused by the red oak which I don't believe. The table requires constant waxing to keep the surface slippery. This is the only draw-back I have found to this saw. If you go to a wood show or fair and see the Hegner or RBI saws demonstrated, consider the price before you buy. I can tell you from experience that the DeWalt is superior to either of these and it costs 1/3 as much! I like the DeWalt saw so much I just ordered a second one because I cannot afford to have my saw down even for a week.

7019	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'm using these clamps as end supports for my work bench. I like the size and adjustable levers. They come in handy when securing long boards. Although they are smaller them most clamps they do support the boards well enough where as only a minor clamp is needed when securing most of the boards before cutting or using a jig. I set up two clamps at the end of my 2ft wide table less than 1ft apart from each other close to the center. After raising the height of the clamps 1/2in off the table by securing a 2in X 2ft X 1/2in board underneath, it allows for thicker boards to be used and gives me a nice fine edge to square the boards for cutting. The clamps can be adjusted and locks in place and so far they have done their job. I use a lot of 3/4in wood and the clamps seem to hold them well enough on the one end.

Using the drill is a pleasure as it has so much torque it just seems to eat the wood up.  No standard hand drill I ever used has this kind of power.  The build quality of the unit is of the highest standard and will likely last a lifetime of moderate to heavy use.  This model is also fitted with Milwaukee's "quick lock" cord allowing easy replacement in the event the cord becomes damaged.
8907	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this tool to help make cuts for installing 3-1/4" base molding.  I'm coping the joints, so how does this saw apply?  When coping the molding, there remains a "straight" portion before the "contoured" portion to be cut as well.  Obviously a coping saw is used for the contoured portion.  However, this saw is AWESOME for doing the straight portion that can not easily be done with coarser-teeth saws, nor any jigsaw or other reciprocating saw.  Easy to start the cut, complete control, and a perfect cut with the fine teeth.

4859	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The Dewalt looked good in the store but I've been a little disappointed.  The machine needs a soft start on the motor to keep it from jumping when you pull the trigger.  Once I learned to maintain an iron grip, I realized that the mark that is supposed to indicate the height of the cut from the fence (or sole plate) is much too far off to be useful at all.  Most of the time you don't need to use the mark - if you just maintain reference surfaces carefully, all will align ok - but sometimes one has to use the marks and on this machine the marks aren't accurate at all.  Having to make complicated setups and test cuts sort of overcomes the purpose of the machine - which is to increase speed.  Finally, on my machine, I notice that when using the sole plate as the reference, actually the aluminum casting extends below the sole plate, so that the sole plate doesn't sit flat on the reference table.  Yes, it can be fixed with a (substantial) bit of filing.... but having to go to this extreme on a new tool, which may not be the most expensive but even so certainly isn't cheap, doesn't seem reasonable to me.
1731	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Is fine, no issues.
but to me it feels heavier, probably because the Holeshooter is more compact.  I also prefer the screw in side handle on the Holeshooter,as opposed the sleeve mounted handle on the 302. I never had any flex in my 302 hande. I like the keykess metal chuck in the 302,it is convenient and it holds bits tight, this chuck has never slipped.
7537	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The handle on this is too big around to be comfortable for me. (Maybe terrific if you have large hands.) I tried it out a little and just didn't like the fat handle, so I gave it away to a friend and he likes it.  A truly handsome hammer and made in the USA!  I think the older models of this hammer had a skinnier handle.  It's too bad. I really wanted this hammer.

If you need a smaller hammer, go with the E3-12S (12-oz.) tool. It is perfectly balanced while still carrying pure punching ability for trim work, paint cans, and other light duty jobs around the house. It's 1.5 inches shorter compared to the Estwing E16S 16-oz. hammer. This also makes a handy hammer for office toolboxes when you need to tack holiday decorations and signs to the walls.
The top which is not to be used as a step "may" have been used that way without any disasters, always follow the manufacturers instructions ;-)
However, the foot pedal sticks out several inches, and it actually got in my way a bit. In addition, if you are like me and wanted to store something in a closet out of the way, you need at least 8-12" of extra space to accommodate the petal. I'm sure the petal is not a problem for most people, just something to keep in mind.
  - You need to use a good quality 4" hose to thread into this to get an airtight seal. The thinner collapsable hose will leak. No clamps are needed with good hose and you'll get a good airtight fit.

As for the blade selection, I admit that it isn't extensive. It is only really extensive for the 7-1/4" saws. However, I have what I need. The included blade is not carbide tipped and is pretty much a throw-away. I bought the Skil brand carbide ripping blade. I also found a higher tooth count carbide tipped blade at a local tool store. The key to getting clean cuts in sheet goods with this (or any) circular saw is to make a zero clearance shoe that goes over the stock shoe.

8891	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	In other reviews the term "sharp" was emphasized.  I'll second that!  This is the handiest little tool I can imagine for making precise cuts.  I don't have rabbits, but a "wild hair" prompted me to build a natural patio table out of some pieces of peach tree stumps.  This saw cut through an 11" dia. piece of peach without a hitch.... using the 9 pt. blade.  The other is a 17 pt. count and makes precise cutting a dream.  The cuts are smooth as the blade is fairly thin.....  Word of caution.... don't get in a big hurry and try to muscle the saw... take what it gives you and allow it to do the work.  It's a Pull Saw... remember?  I couldn't be more pleased with a product.  It was originally purchased to aid me in a stitch'n'glue boat building project ... who knew how versital it can be.  Love it!!!!
A battery powered trim saw might be a smart choice if you will use the tool often; e.g., weekly.  Otherwise, this saw, over the long haul, will be MUCH less costly because it will never need battery, or tool, replacement.  Every battery-operated tool manufacturer periodically changes/improves their battery design.  Next generation batteries probably won't fit your [old] tool and/or will be a different voltage.  So, when the batteries die, and they all will, you'll have to replace the two batteries - and they are expensive.  Or, "your" batteries will no be longer available, so you'll have to buy a new saw.

They work fine, and it's a real plus that they can deal with materials of different thicknesses being joined together.  These are typical Bessey quality -- nice, precise.  I compared them on the shelf to a similar product made by Columbian, but the Columbian was much heavier and had a cheap cast metal look about it.  It didn't seem as precise as the Bessey.

The design of the light, with the flexible neck, lets you set it up in all kinds of positions.

- My scaffold is sturdy. I have two 2x10's, 12' long, with 5/8" plywood on the bottom side (to address the tension component of the bow weight will give to the 2x10's), and each 2x10 has 4" of 3M grip tape centered on them.  They weigh a ton (each), but I feel very secure walking across the "bridge" and I built them to last me a lifetime.
There are two types of problems that one can encounter when using a new tool... the first is a problem with the tool itself, the second is a problem that the tool creates (e.g., gouging the wood is a good example).  With this tool, I've never encountered either type of problem.  The 362VS is a brute, however... it's heavy (which is good), and it wants to "walk" across your wood... so you spend a lot of time pulling it toward yourself.  In a VERY short time, however, you'll master the technique, and the results are spectacular.
6345	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This stuff really works well. I make Native American-Style flutes and use the product to join the two flute halves. It sets up quickly and the wood can be worked in a few hours, although I generally allow 24 hours. A good value.
The performance of this blade is phenomenal!  It is noticably quieter before you start cutting, and a lot quieter while you are cutting.  I performed test cuts in 3/4 plywood, 4/4 pine, 4/4 white oak, and 8/4 white oak.  I was pleased with all of these cuts.  The thin kerf design allowed the wood to glide through the blade with little effort for me or the saw.  The rip cuts did give a smoother edge than any blade I have ever used, but there were some VERY minor saw marks left.  They were so small that I feel nit-picky in mentioning them, but I want give the facts.  Where I was most impressed with this blade was in the quality of the cross cuts.  After crosscutting the 4/4 and 8/4 white oak I was very impressed with the shiny smoothness of the endgrain and the total lack of splintering.  Speaking of splintering, there was none worth mentioning, even in the plywood.
My above range microwave lights burned out (2 of them) and I needed to replace them.  I checked, and the cost for 2 "name brand" ones was a little more than this 10 pack.  If they worked, no brainer.  So I took a chance.

Either that or they simply did not torque them properly, in Asia of course. I have nothing against the Asian people but I see a lot of garbage work from their factories.

I ordered this item, using the Amazon Prime free shipping program. It arrived right on time. There were three boxes in the shipment, one for the stand, one for the table top, and one for the fence. All three had obviously been dropped, presumably by UPS, on a corner. During assembly, it came to light that the table top was smashed on the corner where it was dropped. I contacted Amazon to return it, and the past 2-1/2 weeks has been a nightmare of really bad customer service. First of all, they sent me a UPS paid return label. For one box, not three. I sent an email and asked for them to fix that. They sent me another one, same deal. I then called customer service. Fast forwarding to today, of the five times i have spoken to the Amazon customer service, on only two of those times have I been able to understand the person on the other end of the phone. The rest of the time, it has been someone with a very heavy accent who mumbled.

Compared to the old 1/2" drills, like my 1950s vintage Thor, this drill is half the size and a quarter the weight. It's not much bigger than a decent 3/8" drill even though it has over half a horsepower. If you're doing serious work in wood or metal and can only own one drill, this should be the one.
4897	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I replaced my old one and I would not change to some other line of tool.
429	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	To easy to slid off.. Also it's a touch light-just touch it slightly and you have turned it on..(Not suppose to be touch light). So be Careful, you will run your battery down before you know it.. Not very bright, so if you accidentally turn it on (by touching it) with other lights on, you might not see it, then next time you need it - battery will be dead...
6820	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This tool is invaluable when used for setting hinges! Hold the hinge in place, push the drill against it and know that it's centered in the hole. Works just like a Vix bit only you can pop it out the holder, flip it, put it back in the holder and voila', now you've got a driver to power in the screw. I've gone through three sets as they tend to grow feet and walk away. :(

5944	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is the third finishing sander I've owned (I got it free when I bought my compound miter saw) and of the three its the best in terms of sanding quality and noise.  However, I'd go with a random orbit sander to get better quality.
This router is pretty heavy and is primarily intended for a router table which is where I plan to leave it.  I'll use a different and lighter router for hand held router work.  All and all, I'm extremely pleased with the PC 7518 and have no reservations in recommending it for use in a router table.

7192	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This bit drills just the right hole for it's specific purpose.  Only negative is that it tends to clog with wood shavings and stick.  It greatly improves the speed and accuracy of predrilling hinges.
210	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Nice and bright, stays where you put it. The gooseneck is just right, it is about 7" long. I would describe the light emitted as white or blue, not in the warm range.

5205	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	worked great to hook up dust collector to table saw
The assembly took just over two hours.  The bags of screws are not labeled which makes the assembly process take longer, but otherwise, we didn't have an issue.  It's sturdy and it should last years! :)
This was a bargain of a replacement.  Almost half what I priced this item for in tool stores.
The is no wire reinforcement because reinforcement is  not needed with this hose.  However, for those that believe an internal  wire significantly reduces the builup of static, this hose doesn't fit that  bill, it has no wire.
Update:  Amazon did give me a refund on the bits.

CAVEATS and SOLUTIONS:

9162	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The hose has a fabric on the outside not rubber. In my option it would take a lot to put a hole in this hose.  I have a rubber hose I bought a Lowes, big mistake there, it just hangs on the wall.
5303	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product.
4544	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good glue.  Sets fast.  I use it for gluing spacers in picture frames.  The Titebond III took too long to dry, this stuff holds well and strong and usually doesn't need any clamping so I can spacer the frames faster and don't have to worry about a clamp marring the finish.
Other than that, it may work fine, but it won't fit my DD, so I can't tell.
2276	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Only reason the 4 instead of 5 stars was that while I was waiting the few days it took to get here I found it locally for about $4 cheaper but that was okay since I got what I wanted for a price I was willing to pay (MUCH less that retail) and for less than what most local stores had it....if I had ONLY checked EVERY local store....
5145	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This blade has been touted as the benchmark for all general purpose table saw blade to be compared to.  It is worth all the hype.

Updated:  I sent this back to Amazon for return.  I'm not sure if this is still made in the US or not?  Notice that the one I received wasn't labeled "THE LS STARRETT CO.  ATHOL MASS USA" as in the Amazon product picture.  If it was made int the USA wouldn't they proudly print it on the rule as they have in the past?
2669	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Used it to mill ship lap siding.  I works but the design is such that chips jam in between the base and the fence and push it out of alignment.  Had to stop about every 5 feet and remove chips and check for square.  Kind of a pain.  I like the Dewalt router system but this guide needs some re-designing.

9867	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've been an amateur woodworker for 25 years and in the last 5 or 6 years gotten into more and more projects that require the "right tools".  I bought this blade 4 years ago when it first went on sale in our local area and I love it!  Cuts whatever I feed into it with no difficulty and  leaves a glass smooth edge.  A little pricy in my local area to sharpen but that's life.

4160	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this through Amazon, and have used it extensively to produce 3/8" finger joints for cabinet drawers, and for producing other width dado grooves. It is extremely precise, you can control the width of the dado to within .004"( good enough for most joinery techniques), and it is very easy to mount and use on your table saw. I built my own zero-clearance table insert so that the blades just come up through the insert with very little space to the left or right.
1125	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These light bulbs worked great as replacements for my Ikea under-cabinet lights. It's been a couple months now, and so far so good!
1963	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I began woodworking 10 years ago.  8 years ago I bought my first 7539 Porter Cable.  Today I am still using that same router.  I purchased a milling machine that works with a router.  I went to a local tool shop and told them I needed a strong router that would need to run for long periods of time.  They told me PC was a workhorse and probably the only router that could take such abuse.  They did not lie.  I have milled 5 - 6 foot long, 6" diameter posts with this router making spiral plunge cuts.  I have run this baby for sometimes 10 minutes non-stop -- often -- and she never gives up.  I was so impressed I purchased this router for my table as well.  I use the table more than the milling machine -- raised panels doors mostly.  The one in the table lasted 5 years without ever changing the brushes.  What killed it was the freak flood during Hurricane Ike.  I live in Texas along the gulf coast.  I got 2-1/2 foot nasty water in my garage -- enough to submerge the motor.  I did not think to take the router out of the table before evacuating.  But even so, when I got home I plugged it in just to see if it would work.  I could hear the motor winning but no spin.  I gave the arbor a good tap with a hammer and guess what -- the router started spinning.  I could not believe it.  I sprayed it down (the motor, through the vents) with w-d 40 and set out to see how long it would last.  I got a whole year out of it!  But finally the corrosion won and she died for good.  So now I will purchase another one and next time I have to evacuate I will make sure to pull it out of the table and tuck it away in the attic. I have no idea if Porter Cable has continued the excellent construction of this router or if they have cheapened it, but I will find out with this new one.  I will stick with what I know, and if they fail me, only then will I look elsewhere.
9005	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This worked great the first time.  It is quiet and has no additional vibration as compared to a regular saw blade.  My only complaint so far was the documentation. The instructions consisted of a folded piece of cardboard with washed out 8 pt. printing on gray cardboard.  I did figure it out and I am very happy with the saw.

1589	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	perfect fit for my project - I attached these legs to pull-out bed frame to make it a stand-alone bed! Looks good and sturdy. More work required though to glue together cross-bars of the bed frame to prevent it from making squeaky sounds.
Quite simply put, the ergonomics-mechanics of the barrel grip contribute to the capability of creating an incredibly smooth and accurate cut that these Bosch Jig Saws are capable of producing. I'm being super critical here, the amount of wiggle produced is very fine, much more so than most people would care to think about. If you need to make a perfect cut, and want to do so closer to the line, and spend less time at the orbital sanding station, the barrel grip is the way to go.
Skil made a few recent improvements to the table, or plate as many call it.  Previously, it was just a flat piece of aluminum, but recently Skil rounded the edges which provides much more ridgidity and will prevent it from warping.  I can attest to this as I dropped my newest saw 12 feet off a ladder and the plate is in perfect condition (except for a modest scratch)!  I also highly recommend a rafter hook to prevent such occurances.

Bought it because right after I bought a replacement battery for my drill, the gearbox started having problems.  So I bought the light as to not was the dollars I spent on the battery.
When I was younger, I used to think the Workmate was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen.  I wouldn't have been caught dead using this Father's day nightmare gimmick of a gift.  But after reading The Workbench Book, I bought one.  I use mine alot more than even I thought I would or could, and it never ceases to amaze me the things I can do with it, with a little creative thought.  After myself, it's the most versatile tool in my shop.  In fact, I'm planning to buy another one right now.  If only I could find one of those retro-cool cast aluminum jobs!  No luck so far!  Can't even find one for sale, ebay or elsewhere.  And I've been looking on and off for about 2 years.  Does that tell you ANYTHING?  It should.

2062	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this sander to replace a 3" x 18" belt sander that went up in smoke after using it for more than 20 years.  Compared to the 3 x 18 sander a 3 x 24 sander is more than twice as efficient. The dust collector works very well but only gets about 80% of the dust.  I use a 20 x 20 box fan with furnace filter over the suction side to collect the bulk of the airborne dust.  I read a review about a 4 x 24 sander but opted of the 3 x 24 because of the lighter weight.  I'm glad I did because this unit is a comfortable weight.  You don't have to put pressure on the unit for it to work well.  I'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it for the average home workshop.
Long blade length makes handling the saw a bit awkward for small projects (i.e. cutting off dowels)
8266	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very Pleased
With them they include a bag of small individual clips to fasten them with and keep them straight but, having read about problems with these types of mounting clips, we separately ordered 4' track pieces that are more flexible plastic but, very sturdy and they worked perfectly... the ropes snapped into them snugly and did not break like the small clips that are a harder plastic do.

My only other nit: I wish it came with a switch. It seems like comparable tables in this price range include switches.
1764	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Set up was easy. It took me a few minutes to get the hang of adjusting it, but works great. I've used it on a couple of projects now and wish I'd invested in one a long time ago.

The reason why I take one star away is because the black part is so thick, and if you're using a standard short bit, you end up very close to your work surface.  If you're trying to squeeze in a tight spot, the thick black piece can sometimes get in the way.

We bought this one to go on a shop vacuum at work, and I expect the same gtood results with it.
5 stars again for Porter Cable!

The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is that it didn't come with a rip fence and because the arbor hole in the saw blade that came with it is considerably larger than the arbor on the saw. The rip fence can be purchased separately, but it seems kind of chintzy that they wouldn't include it. As for the blade, well, I'm not sure what they were thinking.

3501	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I really like these and while although some folks say they are just stamped steel and can be made in a third world country..they are very heavy duty and work quite well when set up properly..if I had to make one change on them, I would add Teflon strips to the faces of them..sliding a stained crown back and forth while adjusting the cut can scratch the crown, so I used black electrical tape..it worked fine then.  I will get some Teflon tape and add it later

When I turned this sander on I was literally stunned at how smooth, quiet and effortless the sanding was.  I just let it "float" along the wood using it's own weight to do the work along with a fine sandpaper.  This unit is perfectly balanced and produces truly flawless finishes.

1408	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	When we first purchased our RV, these bulbs were sold in RV stores for $5-$6 a piece.  The parts person would take one out of a sack and hand it to you.  NO  WAY.  Such bulbs should not be touched with your hands.  The oil from your hands will cause them to overheat and break.  One should hold them in a tissue or better yet wear a rubber glove to install. I have sense used two bulbs.  I broke one just trying to install it in the fixture.  This could have been my fault or not.  Nevertheless, the bulbs appear to last as long as others.

I disassembled it and found that I have almost completely worn down the commutator. If I had had 120 volts running through me, then my commutator would have died 18 years ago. Sadly, Makita doesn't sell the armature or the field. Since my metal housing has also been badly worn I will be only too happy to buy another 9924DB. In 1988 it was $ 179.95. Now in 2008 It's $ 199.95. That works out to $ 10 bucks for a year for 20 years of hard service. That's a very fair price for a 4" sander. Thanks Makita !

The 2 LED light is brighter, but had trouble getting even light on both pages, I have to bend the book a certain way to get light to certain areas.

Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4" worm drive, so I grab the 5 1/2" skilsaw.  I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size, and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6.  It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.  You won't be disappointed in this little power house.  By the way, it is not that noisy as another reviewer has written.  If you want quiet, go back to the kitchen.
The flexible neck is about 7.75 inches long.

Another thing worth mentioning, is that this Woodstock W1049 is so light, that it is a good idea to weigh the top down. I use a 10 pound lifting weight. It is round and fits neatly into the center, is easy to grab when unloading the chips, and more than adequately secures the top down to the can without lifting, or allowing any leaks.

9822	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I never thought I would need one of these until I started getting far sighted.  I bought it to mount on my scrollsaw, but I also use it to build railroad models. (I chose N-Scale before my occular decline.)  It is also  really handy when I'm digging splinters out of my fingers; I'm left with a  much smaller hole than when I just use my glasses!  I have had mine for  several years and have never had to replace the bulb yet.  The optics are  good, but as with all magnifying glasses, there is a "sweet spot"  in the center that is the most useful.  It is rather heavy and has a stiff  mechanism, so you need to get a full grip with the mounting clamp on the  edge of your table.  I had it mounted on a compter table that has a beveled  edge, and it would tend to slip off when I swung the arm around.

I carry a 16oz straight claw, a 22oz straight claw, a rubber mallet, a nail puller, and a handy bar in my tool kit to work with me every day. They stand up to the abuse of a lot of rough work and always do what they are supposed to.
Please don't misunderstand me, I am not talking about the top handle model dancing around or anything like that. I am spoiled by Bosch's accuracy, and sometimes use the jig saw to make critical straight cuts using an edge guide. With a fine tooth blade, it leaves an edge so smooth, I just go over it lightly with a little sandpaper when I am done and it looks like a finish edge.

7855	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is a fairly decent block plane for the price.  If you're just doing rough carpentry work it will be fine out of the box (after sharpening the blade).  If you want to use it to make furniture you'll have to flatten the sole of the plane and make sure the blade sits flat on the bed.  If it doesn't you'll need to file down the high spots.  Don't expect it to perform like a Lie Nielsen or Veritas plan because it won't.  There's a good reason those planes cost as much as they do.

When you decipher the instructions that were written by an eleven year old this table works pretty well. It is the perfect surface for me to work on except it isn't straight at all. The middle slat is shaped like an "S" (exaggerated but still). I'd estimate it probably took the photographer of this product hours to simulate a clamp in the pictures because the clamp functionality is more like a "holding" functionality and it barely works at that. The handles that spin together are asymmetrical and bothersome because of that. They're also held together and in sync by something that looks like Scotch Tape and dental floss. I'm not sure where I'd really rank the quality of this product, but it does what I need so I'll give it 4 stars because its practical use outweighs the hilarious flaws I find in it.

 I am somewhat dissatisfied with the  low torque especially noticeable at low speeds.,but this is to be expected in all but the most expensive variable speed grinders.
The tool in question was around 280 pounds, and I found out the hard way that you can't edge the tool onto the base using cardboard and slide it over. The steel is super soft and I bent the front edge down, even though I used wooden wedges to raise it up and over.
This saw has plenty of power for cross cutting 2 x 8 and is very easy to control when cutting plywood panels.  I appreciate the left hand blade which makes it much easier to control exactly where one is cutting.  The blade guard moves out of the way easily and the entire saw, from the long heavy duty cord to the saw housing, speaks quality.
- Fence:  The two sections are difficult to position accurately.  Tightening the knob that holds each side to the table tends to move the fence slightly.  Because they are independent, it's a pain to line them up straight, tighten them down and get the cutting depth set correctly.  If the fence halves are not aligned with each other, the out-feed side is (by definition) either in front of, or behind the in-feed side.  If it's in front, the work catches.  If it's behind, the router bit carves a bit deeper as the work leaves the in-feed fence and creates a divot in your work.

This dado blade has a guide (in the manual) for setting the correct width, it has almost no chip-out and the cut looks like I cut it with a razor.  The true test for me was when I had to make a series of cuts for undersized plywood.  The guide told me what to use to get the width of 19/32 of a inch.  It took me just a couple of minutes to set the dado blade in table saw and make my test cut.  The cut was amazing.  The dado was exact and because the blade didn't wobble I set the fence correct the first time.  If you are planning on making dados find the money and buy this dado blade you won't regret it.

It's not a pain to use two wrenches to change bits, you just do it, that simple. Every tool in my shop has atleast one design flaw. The reality of it is that we buy tools to make our life easier, we want a tool we can rely on and last for years. The 7518 is just that, a quality tool, that with proper care should last the user for years. I've used it handheld,mostly for jig work though, and it takes everything I can throw at it, hard maple to 3/4 MDF, it's all butter to the 7518! You will not be dissapointed with this router.

They are real handy to hold stop blocks on your radial arm saw fence, drill press fence and table saw miter gauge fence.  I hold projects  together during "dry assembly" and while tracing parts for  reproduction.  You can clip a note or plan on anything the jaw will  stradle.  Did I mention gluing?  They're just a little too tight to use for  a nose clamp when you're working around Ralph after he had those beans for  lunch, but you should use a respirator, anyway.
I purchased the optional extension to use for 15 ft. ceilings.  This extension also works well.  This is one tool that I had low expectations and was surprised.  A definite buy for the one man operation.

3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4"x12" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.


4148	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I probably won't ever cut more than a 3/4" dado, so the chipped chipper was a spare anyway, but I still say it should have arrived in factory condition.  I thought the package was a little flimsy, and no doubt the reason the carbide was able to chip out in the first place.  This is a real pricey dado blade set, so a better system of cutter separation would have been much appreciated.


I didn't think I really needed this glue set, that there is not an art to glueing, that all those attachments were just extra "fluff".  I have learned my lesson, I REALLY enjoy being a glue artist, using the right tool and getting the project completed with NO glue overflow!!

3167	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This DeWalt light came with a scroll saw/light/stand package deal at another website.  The light looks great and mounts quickly, but that is where the excitement ends.  The gooseneck is far too weak to support its own heavy head weight given the mounting location on the saw, and how horizontal the light needs to be to reach the work area.

I leave these lights on practically all day, have yet to have another one burn out, and now have 11 more for when I need them!
2136	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These table extensions are nice to have when cutting a larger piece of wood and not having another set of hands to assist you. Setup is fairly simple. I did end up adjusting the mounting brackets by making the extension bind up a little to prevent the extensions from sliding out every time the saw is tipped over.


I like it a lot, and especially like the bamboo parts on the top. The product description does not say that it's made of bamboo so I was surprised. It's a nice step up in quality from earlier models. (I have used a friend's B&D workmate in the past)Product was shipped from Amazon and arrived in perfect condition. It has beefy pressed cardboard parts in the box to protect it. So, don't worry about the reviews which complain of the box offering inadequate protection. B&D must have heard about this problem and consequently addressed it. Yes, the plastic strip which keeps both the hand cranks in "sync" looks like it may not last but we'll see. Overall I think the build quality is fine for most home projects and the relatively low cost of the product makes it a pretty good value.

Everything has to be just right before you can close it. I'm going to modify some of the partitions in the case to fix this. I won't deduct a star because overall I am very pleased with this item.

PS... It's now November and have used the stabilizer since Feb. Have it on the chopsaw now and there is a noticable differance in the sound. No more "clang" and the whining noise is appreciably less.

I haven't tried it out on 4/4 stock yet but I will be using it on  maple soon. It can't be worse than other blades I've used in the past that always want to climb up the stock. My radial arm saw is mounted within my cutting bench and I was thinking of replacing it with a compound mitre saw, but now with this blade my current setup feels more than adequate. I will try to post another review after using this blade on 4/4 x 12" maple for an upcoming project.
7841	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Fantastic hammer.  Well balanced, built to last a lifetime +.  USA made!  You can't go wrong if you buy it and will really enjoy it's feel and the way it handles.  The leather grip is topnotch.  It costs more than the cheap foreign made hammers, but once you use one of these, you will be glad you paid more and got a USA made Estwing.

5810	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	After using this vehicle tool to remove the fur from the car after my dog's shedding season, I decided to try it at the source of the problem - the shedder.  It turned out she was also looking for a good way to remove that extra fur and cooperated entirely, rotating to all the parts that were shedding.  Ten minutes later both dog and owner were happy with the results.  When asked to comment, the dog rated it more effective than rubbing on the auto upholstry, which has been her preferred method of hair removal until the Mr. Nozzle.
The DeWalt is a solid performer, with very little vibration (almost none, actually), very low noise, and a great tension adjuster that allows one to adjust tension while the machine is running. I also like the generous-sized table. The blades are relatively easy to change (it is just a bit of work to load the blade into the bottom blade holder--I just clamp the blade into the top holder, then load it into the bottom holder). The manual is not available at the DeWalt site--I had to visit one of their ServiceNet sites to download an exploded view of the machine. I am still not sure how to adjust the table position in relation to the blade--the side of the blade runs through the hole in the table very close to side of the hole. It would be nice to be able to adjust the blade so that it runs through the center of the hole!!! All-in-all, the machine is a joy to use. I would definitely recommend this scroll saw above any others even close to the price range.
Overall I remain completely satisfied with the choice to get this, though I would concede it is not a necessity item by any means as there are other router setups that will be entirely effective at a lower price point.
9136	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	great american product..will last and last!
I would give this insert 5 stars if it could be ordered with a slot for the DeWalt 7491 curved splitter that comes attached to the blade guard.

7181	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	this set of bits are excelent. Very easy to use,instructions couldn't be more clear. Just make sure that your router's max. RPM are enough for the bit's.
1359	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Nice and bright, seem to last very long, and the price is excellent.
You can also make pipe-protectors from scrap wood. Just cut 2.5" square blocks from soft pine 2x4s. Drill half or 3/4 inch holes in the center of each block's side. Cut the blocks in half through the hole. You will then have TWO blocks that you can rest your panels on so that the wood doesn't contact the pipe. You can use double-sided carpet-tape to hold the blocks in place, or apply a thin coat of rubber cement to the interior of the half-holes so they "grab." You can also use wax paper on the surface of the block to prevent glue squeeze-out from sticking to the blocks. One drop of CY glue or a dab of rubber cement will also hold these blocks PLUS side-cauls in place.

Locking knobs / for the rails do seem to clamp down pretty securely with little to no slop in the fence once they are locked.  Reminds me of the way the wingnuts lock the fence on an old Stanley 45 plane - it was good enough 100 years ago...
At less than one tenth the cost of the bulbs available locally, I would say these are a super deal!
2832	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had a corded 3/8" drill for as long as I can remember, but quite often lately I find myself needing a 1/2" capacity drill. My cordless drill holds up ok power wise but I can sure appreciate not having to swap batteries on a regular bases during heavy work loads like either mixing mortar or drilling holes through 3/8" steel plates. And I'm afraid too, much more of that and I will eventually end up overheating it! I liked this drill because of the 1/2" chuck size, slightly lower rpm's, and all of the reviews about how powerful this drill is. And I can't say that I am a DeWalt 'fan-boy' but I do have a few DeWalt tools that I put through the paces and are holding up through the abuse just fine. So, why not...
4028	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Great for flush cut. Very precise cut.
9570	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a quality coupler that will never fail. It is tough but easy to use.
I also bought the case, the 9-piece template guide set and centering cone, all very nicely made. I was a little ticked at having to purchase the cetering cone seperately. It is inexpensive and its use is inherently part of the touted design features of this router. They provided the template guide adapter, why not the centering cone?
1301	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	all good thanks
8241	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My dados have been perfect with this set. No issues as of yet. Easy to set up with clear instructions
One of the worst attributes of this guy is that because it's so loose and sloppy, you can't get repeatable measurements - even if you align a clamp on a workpiece and then expect the fence to act as a "stop", the distance from the router bit to each end of the fence can shift slightly as you use the tool, so your results end up being slightly off at all times. Really pretty horrible, considering that routers are precision tools.
The saw is now twelve years old or more and is as accurate as when I bought it. What else can I say? It crosscuts 2x12s. Crown mouldings. Aluminum. Anything. I'm trying to get the 998864 blade that is actually designed to cut aluminum. That would be even better.

4087	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product. .It is very important to have this tool at home. Comprar essa ferramenta  um bom investimento. I recommend.

By itself, the table is great and simple. The potential to be even better is the reason I bought it. The table really shines and is extremely functional with the different modifications I have made and I am extremely satisfied.
2216	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a tool expert, but I do use this saw quite a bit.  It is powerful, flexible, accurate and easy to use.  I also use the DeWalt DW730 Heavy Duty Miter Saw Workstation, which I would consider an essential accessory unless you plan to permanently mount this saw.

2817	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely wonderful brute force tool.  I'd rebuy in a hearbeat.  I've had to use mine on some dirty crummy jobs but that's what tools do.
Worked so well my wife thought Norm had dropped by to help me.

Bottom line, I wish i would have had this light 10 years ago.

I Will continue to buy my bulbs from Amazon. No question.
2539	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This stand works perfectly with the Dewalt Scroll Saw.  Perfect height particularly for me at 6'1" but I use an adjustable stool so perhaps a perfect height for all---The stand is easy to assembly and is very strong and made from good materials.  To me this is a much better solution than building my own stand.
9070	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Durable, good cuts.  Normal around the house use - cutting shelves, redoing the deck railings, etc.  Works fine.  Hasn't broken or anything.  Sharp.
1741	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Work well got the job done !
9138	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	A great multi-purpose framing nailer.  The consumables can sometimes sneak up on you, expense-wise, but the convenience far outweights that.  It's a lot lighter than it looks, and will shoot a 3 1/2" ring-shank nail through wood with ease.  For deck and dock work, there's really no better tool.  Mine has been maintenance free, but I do follow the instructions on cleaning it.  Also, make sure you're aware that this gun doesn't include the 'No Mar' tip.  The gun has a 4-prong nose that is the safety; i.e. you have to depress this on the wood before the gun will fire.  Paslode designed the prongs to work well in toe-nailing situations, but be warned:  If you're doing top-level deck work, you'll need the 'No Mar' tip so that you won't leave behind 4 little marks at every nail shot.  The 'No Mar' tip is a simple replacement nose piece that has a piece of rubber, instead of steel prongs, for it's bottom.  No biggie, just wanted to make everyone aware of it.  For pure framing, you won't need it, though.
If you look at the photo, you can see TWO adjustment screws; one with a butterfly-nut (on the upper arm) and another with a loop (on the lower body.) The UPPER nut adjusts spring tension. The LOWER screw adjusts the height of the rollers.

The D-handle is very comfortable, and I find it helps to keep me accurate.

7313	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good Table.  Good sturdy framework.  Excellent fence.  The router insert is not up to the task of holding larger, heavier routers.  Mine started warping from the weight of my 3-1/4 hp Triton almost immediately.  I boxed in the lower framework with 1/4" plywood and fitted a 4" gate so I could hook it up to my dust collector.
First was the assembly of the stand, and the attachment of the table top.  There were things I felt that they should not have left for the purchaser to do, but that was not a big deal, and it went together readily enough.

1) The profiles are handy when not attached to the sander
9104	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Another must have tool. Stay away from the other cordless framers on the market, none can compare to the PASLODE. Great for those smaller jobs when you don't want to pull out the compressor and hose. You'll find it easy to use, lightweight and plenty of power. Be sure to keep it clean. Recently framed an entire 20 x 30 garage with this gun just for kicks to see if it was up to the task. Worked like a charm. If only they made a coil version!!
5199	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use this with my Forrest Woodworker II blade in my Jet 5hp table saw.  It makes an already great blade work fantastic.  The only thing you have to watch is that it does diminish your depth of cut on the table saw.  I still  have over 2" of cut which is satisfactory for most of my applications.  If I need to go deeper, I just take it off.
6320	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It is made to have the hose slipped onto it but if you need to couple it to another fitting it needs a coupling.

6692	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	thanks great item
603	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Mighty Bright is definitely the next generation of book lights.  I used to have the itty bitty book light and I liked it at the time.  This light is better in every respect.  It has 2 brightness adjustments (compared to 1 constant for the itty bitty).  It is also considerably brighter than the itty bitty and quite a bit cheaper.  I can't imagine there is a better book light than this on the market.  I bought a power pack also so I don't have to use batteries at home or I can pack up the batteries and take it on the road.
5516	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	very pleased
2086	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great for smaller jobs and occasional work "in-place." Easy to use and no maintainance. But you will want to look at the very reasonably priced PorterCable belt sanders for larger jobs like doors, or large flat finished surfaces. But if you can only afford one tool to get started or are just getting started, this one is the one to start with.
5212	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Does the job as advertised. I use it with a Freud thin kerf 10 inch saw blade and it does make a big difference. My hope is to someday upgrade to a higher grade Forrest blade, but for now, this makes a moderately priced blade perform exceptionally well.


702	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	They are the bulbs I needed. Nut much too say about them, they are just bulbs. They light up when you flip the switch.
UNFORTUNATLEY the neck is SO WEAK, it flops down if you are using it for long periods, or you move to quickly, or are using it in a plane/car and have a slight jolt. It's so much of a nuisance I gave it away and am looking for another type.

The table has other uses too.  I find that when I'm not using the saw, the table comes in handy as additional work bench space.  I even use it as out feed support for my planer.
4122	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Very good quality. Will do the jop.
7258	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Nice clamps!  They're decently built and solid - not like some of them currently on the market.  I'd buy more if / when I need them.
not like the cheap ones available for a couple bucks less.
What happened:

3268	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since. I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports. The saw has never been serviced or repaired. Some 7 years ago, I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot. That's all I've done to it, and it keeps on going and going.  When it no longer works, I'll get another. But, at the rate that it last and last, who knows when that will be.
2446	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	It is a replacment for the trimmer that I used for many years and the bearings went bad I would have put in new bearings but the brushes did not coperate in the taking it apart prosses. But now I have a offset and a strand base so life is twice as good.
363	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought myself the Xtraflex2 LED book light to use when I read in bed in the summertime. Even though I replaced our old screen with supposedly gnat-proof mesh, the tiny bugs were still flying right through when I used the regular bed light, so I use the clip-on, which is not bright enough to attract the bugs. Unfortunately, if I read for a long time, I begin to get a bit of eye-strain as this light is not quite bright enough for me. I've got cataracts starting in both eyes, so this might not be a problem for everyone.
Cons:  There were 2 flat spots on the metal front roller 180 degrees apart which cause a barely discernible bump but it's not really a problem.  It just sometimes makes it hard to tell if a belt is about to separate or not.
5685	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Just two things you need to know about this blade:
4943	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This is my first biscuit jointer. I was leaning towards the PC 557 when I started looking, but after I visited local store and handled both, I picked this one. Not only saved [money], but this one is more comfortable to handle to  me and the trigger switch is awesome to use. And for the things I make, I  won't need the smaller knife anyway. The only problem with this machine is  the dust control. The dust bag does not work at all. It will make a mess  after a few cuts and get the chips all over my face. So I picked up Porter  Cable 39332 Vacuum Hose for 1" O.D. Dust Ports and couple of adapters  hooked up to my Jet dust collector since DeWalt does not make any of those.  Now I am a very happy camper.
  Clean balanced move on the sliding rail (back and forth) and head (push down and let it up).
3385	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These work really well with my Dewalt compound miter saw and stand. It will help facilitate doing long compound cuts on big crown. I use them about twice a year.
964	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was worried these wouldn't be the right bulbs but they sure were !!
8872	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is a great value. I was prepared for a mediocre tool, given the price point, but it's great. I highly recommend having one of these for detail work. It's very accurate. It's fast, and it leaves a nice quality cut.
2565	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Wow the window in the blade guard allows you to see the line-for years I've had to play peek a boo around the saw. The adjustable handle also makes those overhead cuts easier. This is the last saw I'll buy. It has very easy angle and bed adjustments. I would recommend it to anyone.

5183	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great! Thanks!
8448	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought this blade to cut through a granite countertop.  I used it dry and it cut fast and clean.  Highly recommended.
7945	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My grandfather is in his early 70's and he has an Estwing with a leather grip that he's been using since he was a teenager.  The grip is a little worn now, but that's to be expected after using it nearly every day for 50+ years.  I saw the very reasonable price of this Estwing with the leather grip and I had to pick this up.  My only complaint is the stickers.  I don't understand why they would take a beautiful hammer and cover it in stickers that leave sticky glue behind.  I know stickers exist that can be peeled off with almost no residue left behind, why not use those? Anyway, this is a fantastic hammer that will last you a lifetime if you take care of it.  Hell, it will last you a lifetime even if you don't take good care of it.  But Estwing, for the love of everything holy, lose the stickers.


9760	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	All metal construction, hooked it on to my new goodyear 3/8" rubber hose, and it worked great.
If you are looking for a more versatile system, especially one for small parts, you should also look at Grr-Rippers. If you have a table saw with an iron top, look at Mag jigs too. They are also very good, but they only work on magnetic surfaces, so you either need an iron table-top or must add-on a metal top and fence to make them work.
1499	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	These are great replacements to my range. The halogen lights you could feel the heat coming off them. These are cool to the touch, meaning less electricity being used. Also good for preventing burns as our range has semi hidden buttons and the lights are nearby those buttons. They are of the same brightness as the halogen it replaced.
5240	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Not as good as the aluminum blast gate but for the price they work.
973	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These are the exact bulbs that I've been paying triple the price for locally. I was a little hesitant to order them, since a lot of the review said they arrived broken. I'm glad I gave it a chance, because I had no problem with the packaging. All of the bulbs worked and not one of them was broken. I would definitely purchase them again!
1607	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Arrived on time and working as intended.
9898	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought these drills to make pilot holes for "decking" screws.  There are times when using a decking screw in a particular location splitting of the deck board, or other wood, may occur.  If I think I am in such a situation, I will drill a pilot hole first with one of these bits.  They stay sharp, and have for a while now as I am cautious not to drill into other screws, nails, etc.  They have a combined countersink/counterbore if you want to deeply recess the screw heads.  However, the countersink/counterbore part is clamped to the drill shaft with hex-socket set screws, and they tend to work loose over time.  I find it necessary to recheck the tightness of the set screws periodically.  DeWalt does supply a hex key in the kit to do this.  If not for this, which is admittedly minor issue, I would have given 5 stars.
3901	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've made a few bookcases using screw fasteners, and wanted to clean up the connections. This thing is the cat's meow.
3320	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If you are handy, this is the product for you.
I'm happy.

My only complaint is the simple hold down seems to not be level and is aggravating to adjust because when I tighten it up sufficiently it is like I glued it down.  Is dosent want to let go to make any adgustments.

521	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This Mighty Bright Xtraflex 2 has 2 LED lights and a 3-way switch that cycles between off, one LED on, and two LEDs on. The press-switch seems well made. The design is stylish. I also have an original Mighty bright that had one LED and a shorter base, which was less stable than the new model and a sliding switch (not as handy as a press switch).  I also have a very similar light made by Fulcrum (Multi-flex), which has only one LED, looks cheap, and has a sliding switch that feels prone to breakage. Any of these will get you through many long winter evenings on one charge using three rechargeable AAA batteries. All of these LED lights with a standing base are too large and heavy to use clipped to a paper-back book, in my opinion. However, they clip very nicely in a man's shirt pocket with the LED under your chin shining on the book while you sit in a reading chair, although my wife says it makes me look like a cyborg.
This light is by far the best one I have ever used. It has a nice bright LED light that will illuminate a paperback (both pages) and a hardback (both pages) easily but cuts the light off at the edge of the beam so that others are not bothered by the light being on.
This set is vastly superior to any I have owned before.
6410	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	work good
6508	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I never know what job I am going to run across as a handy man of sorts. My saw arrived today from Amazon today in perfect condition. The first thing that struck me is the versatility of the tilt-lok feature. The Lok itself is very secure. The saw was noticeably quieter than my 6.5A Craftsman with far more power and did not wander a bit from my cut line. As for the base plate I could not see base flex being a problem as others have complained on certain other models.  The base plate was the first thing I examined and tested. You would have to abuse the saw and apply the full body weight of a gorilla to intentionally bend this plate. I also like that the degree markings are easily viewed from the operators position. Be sure to use a heavy duty extension for long runs else you will not get the full amperage that this and other commercial saws require. The saw was dead on at the 90 degree mark and if necessary there is an adjustment in the sole plate for hair tweeks. I highly recommend this saw especially for the handyman where no never know what your going to be up against and versatility is a must. I give this Milwaukee circular saw 5 stars.
8844	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was a self employed boatbuilder and yacht carpenter for 35 years. I used this Shark saw and others like it EVERY DAY. In boatbuilding every joint matters, whether it will be seen or not. Some of the work may be done at the bench.  However most of the time a boatbuilder must make clean and accurate fits when they are in really awkward and uncomfortable spaces and positions. I found this saw was one of my favorite and most important tools in my bag. I had a leather roll made to keep my saws organized, clean and safe. The roll carries six of these types of saws. I always carried three of these Shark saws. One newish, one mediumish and an older one. I am retired now but I am in the process of building another boat. I just received a "RAZORSAW" fine cutting double sided saw all the way from Japan, sold by Amazon. I use it mostly for work at the bench. I would be hard pressed to find any saw to replace this Shark Corp.saw. Great saw. Great value. Get one.
I measured mine when new for those that may be unsure if they match up to their other brands of jointers . . . they are 6.125"L x .6"H x .095" thick and come ground on one edge only . . . my set is labled 'HSS18 - Made in W. Germany' . . . I don't know if they still are made there or not (the W. Germany tells me I have older stock) . . . IIRC the '18' in HSS18 is the percentage of Tungsten content.

5550	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This table is extremely well-made (even though you put it together yourself!). They even include extra screws, nuts, and bolts. My router fit inside perfectly, and everything feels solid and sturdy. I definitely recommend the feather clamps as an add-on.
I suggest if you use different blades such as a narrow, wide and a dado that you get a separate one for each and make zero clearance cuts for each.  If you really want to go all out, get a few for your different dado thicknesses.  You know who you are, the guy who has every toy for his shop and a million excuses for the wife as to why you NEED them.  ;)
4714	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have a Powermatic table saw and was having a hell of a time with the fence and spreader that came with it.  I could never properly align the blade guard and spreader. It was constantly binding.  It was especially bad when I tried to cut an angle.  I ultimately removed the guard.  Like many others I had wood bullets shoot back at me.  Board Buddies seem to be the answer.  The stock is pressed firmly to the table and I have had no kickback.
I use it where I used to use my belt sander, and finish sand by hand or with my small random orbit sander.
3497	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works for what I needed it to do. Had to drill holes in my saw to install them but once in they work just like they were meant to . You may want to check your unit to see if you will run into the same problem. i could see that bing an issue for some.

2586	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	My DeWalt scroll saw fit perfectly. Reasonably stable. It's only sheet metal, but it will do the trick. So get one.


1401	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I cheaped out to buy these instead of the ones I usually buy (http://amzn.to/1YVoHLp). BIG MISTAKE. They performed well initially, but then one of them melted, damaged my light fixture and caused a fire hazard. I remove all the installed bulbs and found that many had chipped bases and blackened areas suspicious for excess heat.
Adjustment is very easy and cuts are very accurate.  I don't know what was the issue encountered by the person who could not adjust the blade but all the tools that came with the joiner fit fine on mine but I would use my higher quality tools when I work on machinery rather than the inferior ones that come with the machines with very few exceptions.  If you are doing woodworking and using a plate joiner, you must have a few tools around to take care of minor adjustments.
Changing blades is quick and easy. Changing the base angle is a snap.

4803	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works like you would expect a Dewalt tool to work. Plenty of power, some nice features not found on other joiners.

If you need a hammer that can do heavy demolition, yet can help rebuild, this is a great hammer. If you need a hammer for basic work around the house, I recommend the 16 oz hammer.

This thing works great too.  I hauled it out to the patio, set it on top of the picnic table and had four perfect cabinet doors in no time flat.  Solid as a rock and simple to set up.
While this tool may seem more expensive than the competition, it comes with lots of things that make up for it.
936	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So I often get uneasy whenever I buy lightbulbs online because my mailman and UPS guy like to throw the boxes on my porch. But these survived really well and they worked. They tend to have about a year life span, but
7108	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have no complaints, other than the fact that it's really heavy (hahaha j/k).  I had to take off a really old slip nut, and it worked perfectly.
 If skil can produce this fine of a tool for a fairly low price Why cant the other tool manufacturers do the same?
  - It's easy to bump this off of the trash container when the system is off. I used a cheap c-clamp to hold it in place on the trash container, hence the 4 stars. Jet should include something to keep this centered on the trash container.
Flashlight still works but pretty much stuck using it like a lantern. Took it in to a shop to see if it would be fixed under warranty. They turned me away.

9167	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This hose is durable and great quality if you try and buy this at a hardware store you will easily pay double. This hose is very well made I have been using mine for about 2 years now and I have not had nay problems with it. I would buy again with out hesitation.
You can use a ratchet instead of the included wrench to tighten the 6 screws to the blocks. It will be easier. Just tighten slowly. Do not over tighten the front blocks or it will not slide easily forward or backwards when you turn the crank. You might even break the plastic vise crank and/or belt while trying to turn it if you over tighten the screws to the front blocks which I think many people did after reading their reviews not knowing why their crank broke and blaming it on where it's made and the product.
3284	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this mobile base because I wanted the flexibility to roll my mitre saw around, which is on a large stand.  I needed to customize the mobile base to the size of the stand.  All my power tools, and I have a lot of them are on wheels that are made for the specific tool.  I had a problem with the mitre saw because of it's odd size.  There was no custom fitted base, that I could find.  It worked out well, but one caution, the wood I used is a bit too flexible and the saw does move a little when rolling it.  I never have an issue while using the saw, but it does bounce a small amount while rolling.  Nothing that would cause a problem.  You can find pictures and further description of the project at ediblefrog.com/topics/frogblogger/delta_50-345_universal_mobile_base
2962	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have been waiting to acquire a decent scroll saw for ten years. Previously, I used a Delta 16" two-speed scroll saw. That saw offered basic scroll saw capabilities; however, it was very inaccurate, with excessive blade side-to-side and front-to-back blade movement. It was **O.K.** but not great for delicate work.
2059	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	A real power house no doubt about it.  I am only going to post my one comment, that is not listed in any of the other reviews.  Maybe mine is deffective maybe not.  I have mine attached to a router table  with a Jessem Mast-R-Lift.  When using a 3 "  panel bit the varible speed is all over the place.  Now in defense I was doing free hand with no guide (NOT SAFE) and taking irregular size cuts off the wood. I wanted to see if it would get bogged down and how it would recover.  It has the power no doubt about it.  It just takes time for the electronic speed controll to tell its brain to speed up.  But remember anyone will tell you to take lots of smaller cuts rather than one big one.  So this may not be a long term issue.  Hope this helps.  BE SAFE.
92	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Got this for my husband as a birthday gift, and he's used it every night since. It seems very well made, and the batteries seem to be lasting for a pretty long time. It's not very heavy, but still feels fairly solid. The clamp is padded on both sides, so it won't mar your book pages. The light has 2 LEDs for brightness control - press the button once to turn it on with both LEDs, press it again to dim the light by having only one LED on, and then press it a third time to turn it off completely.
Forrest sharpening cost:  $20.00
 The saw seems to have good power - I think nothing of ripping full lenth 2-inch stock and it doesn't seem to phase it, just keeps piling up the dust.

More important, this drill can survive the Zombie Apocalypse.
Not cheap, but worth the price in usefulness and ease of use.

It should be noted that the hose is longer than many of the power cords on Porter Cable Vacuums, so if using the power-triggered function of the vacuum, you may want to use a short extension cord or cut the hose shorter.  Otherwise you will constantly unplug the sander or disconnect the vacuum hose.  Tying the hose and cord together adds convenience if the hose and sander are always used together.  Velcro ties have worked best in my shop.

The quality of this coupler will beat anything else on the market by far.  Very easy to operate and NO AIR LEAKS!  Order a set of these for your air tool set-up.  You will be extremely pleased with the high quality and ease of operation of these products.  This is yet another top quality, made in the USA product from Milton.

I have the extra gadgets (protractor and center) for the 12" and all I can say is that they form the standard for all the tuning in my shop, and they never fail.  Yes, they are expensive but at both ends of the supply chain for these tools are people who are very proud of their work.
7769	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love this hammer.  It's a classic look that feels right in the hand and should last for generations.  Plus it's made in the USA.  The 16oz is the perfect size unless you have large hands.  This should be the last hammer I have to buy.

3933	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I  purchased this router specifically to cut dovetails for dresser drawers and it works very well.  The handle helps me stabilize the router and control the power instantly rather than having to reach for the power switch to turn it off.  One caveat about using this product to cut dovetails in plywood veneer:  Despite trying all of the fixes I found on-line for the tear out problem, I had very poor results.  Using solid wood, however, resulted in dovetails that were tight and strong.  This router does what it's supposed to do and is a high quality product.
So...  I don't want to go thru the brain damage of returning this saw to Amazon.  I'm hoping DeWalt makes this right.  Update will follow.  Email sent to DeWalt re: the problems with this saw.
6734	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I live in a Co-Op apartment building that self-manages all of its repairs. This year we have had a major issue issue with moisture working its with through the mortar of our three course brick building. The building will be 100 years old in 2015. We have questions about whether the moisture visible on our walls and ceiling was a piping problem or water from the elements. Also when we could see the staining caused by the moisture, we wondered if it was a new or old problem. Well, this very inexpensive and reliable meter has given us a tool to track the moisture in the wall and check for new moisture after a heavy rain or not. I convinced the Board of our Co-Op to purchase two more so that we would have enough on hand to monitor the highest frequency of issues at any one time. Mind you, though, that I found the only 6 volt battery that would work was the Duracell brand. I had tried Eveready unsuccessfully.

Paid for regular shipping and I received it in only 2days. Win, win all the way around
Very happy with this product.  Sturdy but light enough to be handled by one person, but having a helper is always safer.  I like the properties of aluminum - lighter and stiffer than steel.  I checked out fiberglass equivalents at local home centers but found them too bulky and too heavy.  Always look out for live wires as the metal is an excellent/dangerous conductor.  Keep harsh detergents/alkalis away.

The arbors are very well machined, the saws have sharp, accurately aligned teeth, and they cut very quickly, leaving a smooth hole. Great for electricians, plumbers, handymen, and maybe even homeowners.

2612	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	The light is bright enough, however if DeWalt used a LED bulb instead of a regular incandescent bulb the light would of been much brighter and use much less battery power.  The battery I use in this light is the lithium ion model.  And as I unfortunetly discovered when I was in the far end of  the crawl space underneath my house, there is ZERO warning that the battery is about to go dead.  Your one and only warning is that the light goes dead immediately. Period.  Such are the perils of lithium battteries.  Note to self - take extra battery or another small flashlight next time I'm in a very dark place.

For limited crown molding cutting, you could definitely do without these stops, but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table, you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.

3275	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works real well, I used this for 3 5/8" crown, but it looks like I can cut larger pieces as well.  Easy to install and does not move.
8631	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	My husband was very very happy with this hammer and had no complaints whatsoever, and loved the fact that it is all one piece of steel instead of two joined together.  Very Pleased
This saw is heavier than the worm drive saws you might be used to. To use it one handed you need forearms like Popeye. That having been said, it is a wonderfully powerful saw, zipping through the hardest cuts you can throw at it. Knots in old wood and hidden nails do not even slow it down. You might get smoke and sparks, but that would be the only indication. No more having to roll 4x4 or 4x6 material to complete the cuts with your 7 1/4 inch saw, or finish the cut with a hand saw either. Big Foot does them in one pass. Another thing, and probably the most important in framing is that I can build a doubled rafter and cut it at 45 degrees or a lesser angle in one pass without having to follow up with the handsaw. If you are a builder you need this saw.
I've ordered the 24" version for working with narrower pieces.
8787	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I never used a dado until now (although I have done a lot of woodworking) and this one performed flawlessly.

5723	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've had this a few months and I've used it for a number of projects and I have no major complaints.  I have a Freud FT3000VCE Router mounted in it and after I figured out how to mount it, it's all good. I had to drill some new holes in the plastic adapter, but it wasn't hard and only took a few minutes.  It took a while to put the table together, but the craftsmanship is good and it is very solid.  The only complaint I have is that I had to drill holes to mount my router.  That is not really a ding against the table I guess - maybe more of a complaint against the router for not using standard holes.  I'm not a professional obviously, but I do think this is a good product and I'd buy it again.
Definitely a good deal.
8471	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Terrific set of blades. I bought it to do some box joints for some drawers. Very very flat bottom, slight bat-ears as others have noted but ok for what I am doing. After makiing the sides I cut the dadoes for the bottoms, shims were spot on and again the bottom very flat. Love this set
The LED bulbs will last practically forever, and use very little power, while providing a good white light to read by, and offers 2 brightness settings. The neck is strong and flexible, as is the clip. Good price. Done.
7320	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Does a good job of clamping and the 3/4" pipes don't bend as easily as the ones you get at Lowes.

9763	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Made in USA was my primary reason for buying this coupler.  I have used them in the past years, but never really paid much attention to where it was made (foolish).  Excellent quality, leak free.  The best!

2852	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I liked the rear pivot and the heavy alum base, along with its electric braking making it a good solid saw.
When I get it back I'm only going to use it for cutting solid wood.  I'm going to buy a cheaper blade for cutting MDF and plywood.  The cuts from this blade have to be seen to be believed.
9718	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love it, easier than the craftsmen. Both work great.

EDITED FEBRUARY 12, 2012:
I do hope you spend a few dollars on a system for yourself, I spent around a grand and am very happy with it.
Storage case to protect.. Somewhat cumbersome to load into the case if you have to do that a lot (but I don't know what to compare this to)..  Probably the weakest point about this dado (you have to spread the teeth (I believe you do) as you load it into the case to protect all the teeth..
I would recommend this set to anyone with the Porter Cable router
The saw has  lived in indignity under my side bench for years, getting hauled out for a  variety of tasks.  I am a woodworker hobbyist and amateur household  carpenter.  I use this saw for the occasional garden shed, rough-cutting  sheet goods,  and to make sets and furniture for theatrical productions (I  married an actress).  In my light-duty work the saw is a marvel.
4319	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Sturdy and well built. Getting plane blade adjusted takes a bit of work. Follow the reviews and instructions and you are able to get a finely tuned plane in no time. Worth the $$ for any wood worker.

7355	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I needed some additional clamps for a dresser I'm making.  I knew these clamps had a good reputation so I read the Amazon reviews and bought four of them.  These are great!  The screw mechanism is very smooth and easy to use.  My other clamps used 1/2" pipe.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these clamps that use 3/4" pipe.  The 1/2" pipe clamps can flex.  I did not see any flexing with these 3/4" clamps.  Sure they cost a couple of dollars more and the pipe will cost a dollar or two more, but it's worth it.  I would buy these again.

These fit in my fixture, although they are longer than the bulbs they're replacing.
8921	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I don't know what all these reviewers that talk about chipped teeth are talking about? The chipperd have flat top teeth and the outer blades have beveled. As for perfectly flat bottom dados - no dado set makes perfectly flat due to the fact that there is space between the chippers and blades and as for the kerf ticks in the corner again this is how they are designed all dado sets to this. Ugh some people!! This set is perfect for the hobbiest and weekend wood worker for the price you can't get much better.
1612	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Porter cable quality, I managed to break the one that came with my new Router by overtightening it without a router bit in the collet.  You will probably only make that mistake once (I hope).
So, yeah, this thing costs 2 or 3 times more than cosmetically similar chinese made lifts, but it appears that it makes up the difference in durability and longevity.
Though this issue may be resolved if store bought lumber was actually the size they claim it to be.
 - the motor was strong and when I applied gentle pressure to the work surface it did not bog down.
7993	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The reviews were mixed on this item, there were more positives than negatives so I decided to give it a try. The first thing I discovered was than the plane was made in Mexico. Just like other brand name tools, Stanley has taken their manufacturing of what used to be quality tools to foreign countries. No OHSA, no EPA, no vacation, no overtime pay, no employee benefits of any kind, just long hours until you drop dead and there is always someone waiting to take your place. SHAME ON YOU STANLEY! There are just as many Mexicans in the U.S. as there are in Mexico so they didn't have to move there. Now for the tool,...like others who expected a little quality in the tool, I found none. I fully expected to have to lap the sole of the plane, you have to do that with any new or vintage plane. It took a good hour of lapping to get the sole reasonably flat. The blade of course had to be honed as well. Upon reassembly I discovered that the blade does NOT extent below the mouth of the tool unless the mouth adjustment is set so the mouth is fully extended. Close it up just half way and the cutter jams against the mouth. So my question to Stanley is why is there an adjustable mouth when it is totally useless? With the mouth fully opened up you can extend the blade to take a fine shaving, provided you have flattened the sole and honed the blade. The lateral adjustment is a joke as well. I had already flattened the soul and honed the blade before discovering the flaw with the mouth so I can't return it. My advise is buy a good vintage plane or one of the higher end planes unless you wanted to drop $40.00 bucks for a paper weight.
6562	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Had one of these for many years, lasted longer than the router, the new router mounting holes conflicted with the older holes so it had to be replaced, excellent base plate

1075	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	First, the price: it's just great.
If you're a homeowner/occassional user, the price puts this in the realm of serious consideration.  If you've got three or four sheets of drywall to put up, you don't need it.
385	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This works great and really casts a very bright light. I love it. The clip is firm, although it can slide like most clips, but that is to be expected.
1123	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what was needed.
Overall, I'd buy this again in a minute.
Several previous reviewers have covered the essentials: it is inherently somewhat underpowered, and must be kept on perfect adjustment for true perpendicular cuts.  It is noisy and messy. I wondered for the first few weeks if overall it was worth the bother.  On ripping, in particular, even with a freshly sharpened blade, it was SLOW!
420	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	does what it supposed to do, has two options for lighting, 2 LED lights or just 1, i use only one for my purposes. great stuff, comes with batteries and that prompted me to buy this one instead of another one i saw that was a lil cheaper

7114	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Very well made. I did not test if it's perfect center but it wokred perfectly on the job. Seems like a solid made product
I have a few other DeWalt tools so I would normally have plenty of charged batteries around, so I appreciate not having the unnecessary expense and bulk of yet another battery and yet another charger.  Obviously if you haven't already bought into the DeWalt "system" it's probably not worth going there for a glorified flashlight.  But since it's clear this unit doesn't come with a battery and charger just use some common sense here...
5231	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	As others have said here, these pads are P*ss poor. With all the negative reports, you'd think Fein would get a clue.

8258	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	In addition to this protractor I now own quite a collection of Incra rules in different sizes and configurations (straight, T, bend, protractors). All of them are based on the 0.5mm pencil marking holes and slots. I cant imagine going back to standard rules and gauges and expecting a level of precision and accuracy that you can get with the Incra rules. Whoever thought this idea up, and then went to the trouble to commercialize the idea, is quite simply a genius. I should probably say a genius that spent a lot of time and frustration and rework measuring and marking with conventional rules. When you consider the benefit Incra rules provide youll quickly realize the price is a bargain.
The unit comes with two blades, and you might miss them as they were attached to an unmarked small plastic bag.

Expect to have to practice a little with it first, until you get the technique down.  You typically run this thing all out at top speed without letting up on the trigger between screws.  Most people have trouble until they figure that out.

FEIN blades always perform well.

3123	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I built a movable base for my on the deck wood meat smoker with this kit and it worked out very well at first but I am now revising my review after some minimal use.  The lift feature failed after a very short period of use.  The lift starts to sag because there is too much slop in the tolerances and then the wood hits the base and you are stopped.  The caster on the lift end rusts and pits quickly.  The lift arm does not work well - if at all and requires constant adjustment.  The metal tolerances are way off and wear quckly.  In the end - I threw it all in the trash where it belongs.  I do not recommend this base.

4226	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I actually have an original C8FB. The C8FB2 is even better: self-retracting guard is the best. As you lower the saw, the guard pulls itself up via a linkage. My older model allows the guard to touch the wood and is pushed up by being in contact. Not bad on 90 degree cuts but if the saw is laid sidewise, the guard binds against the blade. They fixed this problem elegantly on the B model.
They are easy to connect to your drill, and they cut holes well.  I know they were marketed as something for plumbers, but you can use them in other trades.
I purchased the Delta 50-302 out feed table to extend the bed of my Delta 36-L51X Unisaw.  Prior to this I had been using roller stands as out feed support when ripping long stock.  The problem with roller stands is that it is difficult to get them the exact height of the saw table, and even if you do, this won't work when ripping long stock because the stock tends to droop below the table height before it makes contact with the roller.  So now you're in a predicament. Do you continue to force the stock through the saw and hope it rides up and over the roller? Do you stop the saw and move the roller forward to support the work, only to discover that the shortened support distance from the saw table causes the stock to tip up and over like a teeter-totter when the cut is complete? Do you use several rollers in series?  The answer is none of the above, you forget the rollers and purchase an out feed table.
8810	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I can't express how much this saw amazes me.  I needed to cut an 1/8" strip off a 4' long piece of 3/4" plywood, so gave it a whirl.  It was so easy!  I find myself just grabbing this saw for simple cuts rather than powering up the chop-saw.  The pull-cut takes some getting used to but once you get into a rhythm it offers way more control than a push-cut saw.

4913	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought it as a back up to the one I already had which is about 18 years old so these are great tools now I have one *00 grit and one with 3000 grit very happy
3943	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this attachment a couple months ago, and it has proven to be a real surprise.  Since it is an inexpensive tool, with the more inexpensive chisels and bits included, I didn't expect it to be a precision tool, but  it really does well.  I have now used it to make mortises in red oak, white  pine, and southern yellow pine, and am glad that I didn't spend more money  than I did.  The other reviewers are absolutely correct that set-up is time  consuming, but for a hobbyist woodworker like me, it does the job  efficiently, cheaply, and well.  I would definitely purchase this item  again.

Within its limits, this tool does an excellent job.  Irwins 6 clamp is a much larger more rugged version of their&nbsp;, and is better suited to heavier duty tasks.  Given that it can do so much more, the higher cost of the 6 clamp seems appropriate.  If you need a simple slider type clamp, take a look at these two models and see which may best meet your needs.

I suppose they are weaker in some dimension than the wood screws, but how much strength do you need?
8902	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is great, it's like a gateway drug or something. Now all I want is an actual high end Japanese one. But this thing still performs so well I don't have real need to replace it yet.

8926	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I used this to cut into 6x6 pressure treated wood.  It cut smoothly....just like butter.  The other brand of Dado just burned both the blades and wood.
Square cuts right out of the box.  Good set of shims that made adjustments easy.  The only thing I would like to have seen was the marking of the cutters (i.e. C, D, E etc).  Other than that, this is an excellent product.
4686	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this Freud Industrial class blade from Amazon for use in my Ridgid sliding compound miter saw some time back, and it has worked in a championship way. It cuts clean, although it is no speed demon, and one thing it can do well is cut shallow dado grooves with no tear out. I did this when cutting 45-degree angle embellishments on two picture frames I recently built. Standard crosscuts are very clean as well.
The POWER.  It cuts wet framing lumber and quarter sawn white oak with equal ease;

Overall, that's why I still prefer these and recommend them for any woodworker or homeowner.
7457	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Work great and can't beat the price anywhere locally. I previously bought the 1000 pk of 1 1/2". I wish the 2 1/2" came in the 1000 pk too.

- Overall, really happy with it and I recommend the brand to anyone who asks.
 For maximum versatility, consider purchasing a 24" rule to go with your square (McMaster-Carr, $73). It is interchangeable with the 12" rule supplied with this kit. It allows extra measurement range and I use mine almost exclusively. You might also consider getting a smaller square, like a 6". Experiment with your squares, and you'll be amazed at everything you can do with them. You can measure inside dimensions of cabinet openings, run parallel lines, and a million other things. Easily the most useful tool you'll ever own. What else can I say? Starrett is good old American quality built in Massachusetts. Yankee ingenuity at its best.




6946	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I built a shed recently with a wide door to accomodate big tools.  I made this door out of 2x6 tongue-and-groove decking boards, which I needed to clamp together to attach 2x4 bracing.  So a pair of "Pony" clamp fixtures and a couple lengths of black pipe was just the ticket -- or almost.  The decking boards needed a bit of persuasion to get all 9 planks together, and I didn't want to gouge the nice oak.  Some cedar shims against the clamp pads promptly crumpled when I tightened the clamps.  So I left the door until the next weekend and ordered these clamp pads.

2691	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use the heck out of this tool, probably every week.  I've had it about two years and haven't had a lick of trouble.  The on/off switch on mine has worked without complaint.  The speed control has also been reliable and is a nice feature on occasion to lower the speed on more delicate items (although I usually run it wide open).  I don't really have much complaint about the vac attachment; mine wiggles loose sometimes, but not every minute (if anyone honestly knows of one that doesn't every come loose, feel free to buy me one for Christmas; I think it's just the nature of the beast).  Dust collection (with my Fein vac) has been excellent, especially when sanding wood.  I have almost no clean up after.  I've also used this for some moderate drywall work (remodel stuff) and it's been up to the task.  That generates a little more dust than can be controlled with such a small tool, but I was still able to capture about 85%+.
1986	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great Product! I have had my Porter Cable Routers now for 16 years and I have tried them all. The best to go with is the 3 1/4 HP! The smaller 1 to 2 hp are not worth the aggravation, but they help with the smaller Profile router bits for maneuverability, the armature burns out within a year with everyday use. Great for Hobbyist though.
7652	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Top of the line great set
8880	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	While Starrett seems to be producing a lot of new tools that are of questionable quality and accuracy, thankfully, this is not one of them. This is a high quality, extremely accurate tool that is made in the tradition of the machinist's tools that Starrett has manufactured for over 100 years. While you can find a combination square for much less money you won't find one that will feel better in your hands, be more durable or one that you will be more likely to pass on to your children or grand children after many, many years of service.
Now that it has been beaten into submission it works fine.
Two other mentionables for competition are the Porter Cable air driven, and the Dewalt DW160. The Porter Cable air driven comes in at half the price and has a keyless chuck. It does reverse as well. The one drawback is that you don't get the degree of torque out of small air driven tools (monster impact guns excluded), and you need to have air. Lugging the compressor for a big job is not a problem, but for those small adjustments, it can be a nuisance.

- The threaded black pipe recommended for use with these clamps comes with black grease to lubricate and deter corrosion.  Clean this off before attaching the clamps so you won't mess up your wood.

2131	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Very necessary when ripping sheets of plywood.  Directions are poor.  This attachment should be put on before table saw is set up as it says saw should be placed upside down to install.  My saw was already mounted on a rolling stand.  I got it done without taking the saw off the stand but it was a pain in the butt.  This support could have used a little more design time, it works but it is not great when compared to other brands.

7632	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Very nice and of good quality I do a lot of research usually before I buy something and this is recommended by me!
There is no comparison between these handscrews and say, quick acting bar clamps (like Irwin Quick Grip).  The primary difference is that you can apply far more force with a handscrew than with most any other type of clamp you would use in its place.  These are also great for temporarily clamping lumber to your workbench or to a jig while machining.  With a handscrew, you can be confident that the workpiece will not move.
7430	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	This was a necessity for me when building my last house as there were some large beams that my 17" Makita Circular saw could not handle.  The only gripe is the jagged edges it leaves, but it does get the job done.
I own 5 Stabila levels (digital, door frame, long and short) and I love them all.
Problem #1.  The blade was rubbing on the side of the blade hole in the table. It took a bit of manipulating the two screws that secure the table to the bevel gauge but I got the blade pretty much centered.  There is no side to side adjustment to account for this.  That's just not acceptable.
8328	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	good product

4191	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	As a carpenter who cuts a lot of plywood, I was interested in upgrading from a 'wobbly' dado to this system.  In general I was impressed with this set.  The plates and chippers are all substantial.  They are manufactured out of nice thick, flat stock, with large carbide teeth and a nice clean black finish.
3545	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I finally got fed up with my sub-standard circ-saw while doing a large deck framing job that required close precision. After researching all the "pro" saws including the Dewalt I decided to go with the Skil MAG 77. I must tell you, I am not disappointed. This is simply an amazing saw. It tracks perfectly, allowing you to make not only precision cross cuts but do quick job-site ripping by hand. One of my main reasons for opting for the Skil was its superior gauge design. The Dewalt has an raised arch rim on the front of the foot that makes it impossible to site across the blade and the front reference mark at the same time. The Skil's foot is flat allowing you easily to site across the blade and front gauge.  BOTTOM LINE: One of the BEST power tools I've ever purchased - definitely worth the money!

There is a bit of dialing in the cutter heights, but that is to be expected, but once this is done you're able to make fantastic and professional looking raised panels.  I'm on Amazon now looking for different raised panel cutters, so I can do this with some variety.  I highly recommend this set.

To tell you the truth, I owned this tool for quite a while before I ran across an application for it.  I guess I could've used it when caulking windows etc., but at the time it seemed easier just to grab a regular caulk gun.

The on/off switch has a nice snap and weight to it, so it feels like it will last.  We are using this saw/light in a room with poor lighting.  The bulb is plenty bright.

However, I was most concerned about whether a hybrid saw could push an 8-inch dado; some recommend at least a 3-HP saw with this diameter. But it worked great with the 36-717, a 1-3/4-HP model. To be safe, I still make deep cuts in a couple passes, but I've never had a problem.

=== The Good Stuff ===
3. Arbor Length - Measure the length of the arbor on your machine and subtract the thickness of the arbor nut from that measurement. If what you have left is at least 1 3/32" then you can cut up to a 3/4" dado with your saw. If you have 1 3/16" or more then you can stack all the components on the arbor at one time. Still keep in mind that you must comply with maximums that the manufacturer of saw has for dadoes.
Finally--if your wood is really hard, wet it with a sponge before planing. Let the water soak in for about 30 seconds. This dramatically softens the grain, and eases planing. Don't worry too much about the wood getting wet and warping. With hardwoods, the water doesn't soak in much, and the wet wood is removed in one or two passes through the planer. I have used this technique when my blades were beyond sharpening and I didn't have a spare on hand.
4293	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If there's a better jig saw blade out there, I haven't found it.  These blades are sharp.  They zip right through plastics and other synthetic materials without melting the material.  Even if forced, heat does not build up in the blade.  The down cutting design keeps the cut line clear to view.

It only lights about 1/2 page at a time and I had to keep moving in order to light pages. I found a much better light at barns and noble for the same price it has 5 or 6 lights across and can be used as a flashlight too, called a hammerhead by mighty bright.

3935	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I've owned this router for more than 10 years.  It is dead reliable.  I prefer the D-handle version as it affords better control.  The 690 line is still THE standard reference for routers, though the design is aging.  I would expect that anyone buying this router would be quite happy with it, but as more and more routers come available with variable speed, soft-start, better adjustment mechanisms, shaft locks, etc., the decision is harder than it used to be.  10 years ago I would have given this router 5 stars.  The quality hasn't changed, but the market has.  If a basic router fits your usage, however, you've found the right one - and without maintenance worry on features you don't need.
510	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Really nice light, seems well built and very useful.  The clip opens wide to grab onto large item like head rest stem in car for kids to use in backseat.  Great for an audio cabinet or to highlight home bar area during parties.
Another thing to be careful of-- they come with felt pads so they don't scar your face frames, but they are heavy and the outer edges will ding your shelves or whatever surface you put them on if you dump them carelessly.

9804	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I recently puchased one of these 50' hoses for my new DeWalt twin tank air compressor.  This is by far the best 50' hose on the market today without question.  It remains totally flexible in cold temperatures unlike those vinyl coiled hoses on the market.  It also lays flat when in use and does not coil up in places.  You don't have to worry about tripping over this hose.  The couplings at each end of the hose are very high quality and the yellow color is very noticeable to keep others from snagging the hose and tripping on it.  The 50' lenght is perfect to allow you to move about freely and not relocate your compressor often.  This is a great product and the price is right.  Get one of these.  You will be glad you did.
As I said earlier I really didn't use it yet but it seems very nice to me, if it helps, the date on the shipping tag is June 2006. Maybe they have corrected that problem now. I am sorry to hear about the other folks issues though. I too like Dewalt products and have many.

Easy to pull from the box and go right to work.  The air system works well to "puff" away the sawdust that builds while cutting (very good).  The table is true and large enough for all types of scroll work.  Blades are very easy to change----saw is very easy to use---very safe too.  Priced a bit high but there really isn't competition at this level.  I replaced an old Delta that I could no longer get parts for.  I use the Dewalt stand and find this to be a perfect fit.

UPDATE: I decided to build an outfeed table for my saw.  Most designs expect to use the same holes in the back of the table that are needed to attach the big tube to the saw.  As a result, having this blade guard installed seriously complicates attaching an outfeed table.  I ended up using a piece of iron plate (hardware store) to join the wooden outfeed table, using the same bolts that hold the big tube.  It works great now, but it was difficult to design, build, and install.

When assembling the table system, take great care to prevent stripping out the screw holes in the MDF table. Two rules to remember, and the assembly should go without a hitch. Rule #1 - do not use a power tool to tighten down the screws. Use a hand held screwdriver, and get each screw just snug (SNUG means the screw head has made contact with the surface, and you use your thumb and index finger to tighten as much as you can. Do NOT try to tighten these screws too tight - they WILL strip if you do). Once snug, turn the screw 1/4 turn more, and you're done.  Rule #2 - this table assembly is heavy once it has been partially assembled. Have a second person to help you lift, and move the table around as you assemble it. Lay the table upside down when attaching the top, and bracing to the stand. This will give you a much better view, and better control. And again - Have someone help you move it around as you assemble it. This thing gets heavy quick!
5999	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great clamp, well made!
This jig is one of them. One of the legs was bent out of the box, took some creative straitening methods to get it to work at all. Finally got it assembled and working, sort of. This thing is too flimsy to be of any serious use. Doesn't have enough mass to use it on large leg sections. I'm afraid the push tab will bend. Adjusting it by eye is not a big deal, but the flimsy lock mechnism does not instill confidence in a repeatable cut. The whole thing flex's when you push the piece thru the saw. After wasting a couple hours and a few pieces of scrap wood, I decided this jig should go back. Unfortutely it was purchased at HD, who wouldn't take it back, since it had been assembled and used. So on my way out the store, I tossed it in their dumpster. I'm going to make my own out of some hardwood and brass fittings. I know I can make something a lot more useful than this. Can't recommend this jig, except as a model of what not to do.
2189	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I just took delivery of this saw and matching stand, and I am really impressed with the quality of the product...
7988	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Overall, I am very pleased with the WM425. It works as advertized and is very compact. The assembly instructions are terrible at best and should be reviewed carefully prior to starting assembly. The latches that allow the user to raise the WM325 to the upright position are not easliy seen and there is only a brief mention in the instructions.
I may add a blade stabilizer, though Freud claims you don't need one with this blade.  The plate is a bit thicker near the arbor than it is at the teeth.  A 3.5" should do it.
If you are having fit problems with the thickness of the slots, look at the biscuits you are using and not at this machine.  This joiner cuts extremely accurate and consistent slots but biscuits can vary in thickness if they are of poor quality or if they have been exposed to the air and have absorbed some moisture.  The best biscuits I used have been the Bosch ones but they are usually significantly more expensive than the Porter Cable ones. If you use the lower quality biscuits, make sure you check them for fit before assembly time.  You will end up throwing some biscuits (maybe 5%-10%) but that is not bad considering the price difference.  However, if you are doing some fine work, go with the high quality biscuits because the difference may show then.

Shape-wise, the handle of my hammer reach its maximum in the middle section. The hammer shown in the stock photo is thinner, and its handle size peaked at the very bottom.

Adding the big folding table to the hinge was then trivial and required no adjustments or cutting. You also don't need 2 people, because one end can rest on the floor while you insert the screws. My TS300 is on a wheeled stand, so the vertical brace is not long enough. The simplest solution was to just put a wood block under the vertical brace made of glued 2x4 pieces. Problem solved.
Another thing to consider. This is a very heavy router. I made my own baseplate for mounting in a shop-made table out of 3/8" Lexan as I'd seen done elsewhere. Mistake. There's simply too much flex in the Lexan under the weight of this router. Invest in something more solid. There's work involved in making the Router Raizer work with your baseplate, and you're only going to want to do it once.
9767	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So I ended up ordering 2 of these because I've got a Dewalt mid grip drill that is reaaally powerful and it makes screwing really hard. (No pun intended.)  These both arrived looking good.  The metal jacket slides up and down and is held in my a C-clip at the base and i think another on the inside of the cylinder.  I used it to drill a few 3 inch screws into some 2x4's last night to test it out.  It worked great.  The magnet was ok at holding the screw on; adequate, which is good enough to to me.  When the screw slipped a few times it stayed contained and quickly went back on to the screw. No more mared up work!!  It helped prevent stripping the screws too, though it didn't remove the risk entirely.  I still needed to be gentle on the trigger and keep the pressure on the back of the drill.
As it is, this one saw is good enough to last me for the foreseeable years I might need it.

Overall, for the expensive price of this, I expected much more.  The Biesemeyer guard is much better designed and has dust collection.  It may not have the remote switch, but I'd rather have DC and be able to open my saw cabinet.  I'd take any of the others instead of this one.
Tooling Quality - Excellent.  Cast iron platten.  Adjustable height and angle.  Clearly indended for jointer knives.  When teamed up with Highland's jig, the tooling is superb for chisels, plane irons, etc.

I have never had a problem with this & it has never let me down.
It comes in an all-aluminum version, I believe, but since I frequently do electrical work, the non-conductive fiberglass legs are a valuable feature.
UPDATE:  I have used this drill for while now to do some really HD type of screw driving and drilling.  It is one stout drill!  You had better hang on because it has VERY good torque for such a small drill.

The crank style handle worked very smooth and has adequate travel.  The adjustment with the handle was such that either light or heavy pressure could be applied with ease.  The clamps can also be set horizontally on a flat surface allowing you to edge glue pieces for tabletops very easily.

Like a lot of guys, I have been slowly building up ('collecting' is probbaly a better word) a supply of tools over my lifetime.  Most years, my wife gets me a great big plastic toolbox on Christmas to hold all my tools when I need to travel (help grandpa fix a leaky pipe, install a new hot water heater for my aunt, help an uncle work on his car, etc.).  But I noticed a problem.  All of these toolboxes were becoming impractically large.

I had bought a cheaper saw but after a few cuts, noticed that there was no way of getting a straight cut because there was so much slack in the arbor.  I guess it would have been alright for rough in work or framing, but not trim.
8962	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this Dado set on line from a woodworking supply outlet and when i recieved it i went to install it in my Dewalt DW744 contractor table saw. My saw has a 5/8`` arbour but European blades have a 30mm or 1-1/4`` bore, Dewalt overcomes this by supplying an outside blade washer with a 30mm protrusion which locks into the blade bore. I had two options when i bought this Dado set, i could have bought one with a 5/8'' bore or a 30mm bore. As all my table saw blades have a 30mm bore i assumed the Dado with the 30mm bore would fit my saw. Sadly it didn`t, the two outside blades went on fine but when i tried to install some chippers between them they just sat down on the blade arbour. The outside blade washer`s protrusion isn`t long enough to support the chippers, obviously i didn`t try to turn on the saw with this configuration. In my own defence this was my first Dado set so my knowledge of them is limited. Freud makes some assumptions with the instructions on this set, i just don't understand how a saw with a 5/8'' arbour can be fitted with a Dado set with a 30mm bore. I can't speak for other saws that are manufactured for the European market but i'm fairly sure that they all have 5/8'' arbours with outside blade washers with 30mm protrusions. Unless Freud are selling adaptors with a 5/8'' bore with a 30mm outside diameter, i don't understand why they are selling the 30mm bore Dado sets. This problem won't be an issue for Americans or Canadians as 5/8'' bore tablesaw blades and Dado sets are standard in those countries.

 Milwaukee makes a keyless chuck version of this drill, but I do not recommend it. For the types of tasks this drill is designed to handle, you will want no possibility of slippage. The keyed chuck on this drill is as beefy as they get and is up to any task. Milwaukee also makes an 8 amp version of this drill. Such a machine seems like it would almost be dangerous, as this 5 amp version is perfectly capable of wrenching your arm. More amps isn't always better. This drill does not slow down, and would probably blow a circuit before it stalled.

We use this router motor in conjunction with the Bench Dog lift and table to make a "mini shaper" for some special machining. Have bought and installed 5 of these routers.  I just use the motor in the lift.  I have not used the router on a base free hand.  It is heavy.  I would reccomend this model more use in a router lift or for a heavy duty operation like sink cutouts or pattern cutting.  I think you buy this one for its power.  The soft start takes a little getting used to.  With the router lift and table you really need the switch Bench Dog makes to mount on their router tables.  No way to see the switch on this router when it is upside down in a lift.  Bench Dog sells a switch for their router tables that I will try.

2376	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was conflicted about buying this fence until I finally found a review that mentioned my specific router. The answered questions are all over the map with some being quite wrong. So I'm writing this to hopefully clear up confusion for others.
The fence is also very nice, with tool free adjustable sliding MDF inserts to close in around the bit, a T slot at the top for accessories, and tool free hold downs for moving it around the table top. The fence also has a built in 2 1/2" dust extraction port, which in my experience is about 85% effective when attached to my dust collection system. Running the table with no dust collection is extremely messy, as shavings will fill the inside of the cabinet as well as be expelled from the collection port about 2' out if the fence is attached. This is probably the only aspect that is a negative when using the table. There is an obvious temptation to use the lower cabinet as storage since there is a lot of space in there, but it will inevitably fill with sawdust and cleaning it out if there are items in it is not ideal; I have just resorted to leaving it empty.

When I saw that they changed it to a new plastic model I was hoping for more space, but the new case seems even smaller.
First use - On some scrap wood I put a few slots in it and it took a bit to figure out how the biscuit depth/size (0,10,20) was registered on rotating adjustment, once I figured this out, it was off to start joining boards, once the locations for the joint are identified, lineing up and maintaining the joiner on the spot on the wood was very easy.  There is a springloaded abrasive (I don't know the technical term for it) on the face of the tool where the blade retracts that once the device is held tightly against the work surface, it holds the joiner in place for the duration of the plunge and cut.  It does generate a good bit of dust and depending on your position it can end up towards your face.  Eye protection is a great idea (as well as ears) when using this or any power tool.  The cuts that it made (I've used it to make about 100 slots now) have all been very clean and accurate.

Installation was easy, took no more than 10 minutes.  I suggest you wear a mask when you raise the blade to make the initial cut with your saw blade to establish the channel -- the burned composite material of this insert stinks to high heaven.  I used a dremel tool to smooth out some high spots on the support ridge that sorrounds the insert.

The primary reason for buying bigger chop saws is to cut wider boards. A 12" chop saw cuts a wider board than a 10". However, that reasoning doesn't apply to a sliding saw - a 10" cuts about the same width board as the 8-1/2". Another reason for a bigger saw is power and I was skeptical about the 8-1/2 when I set it up. However, I cut primarily hardwoods and have found the 8-1/2 adequately powered. As other reviewers point out, the 8-1/2 only bevel cuts to the left. That is a definite negative, but you can usually rotate the board and compensate. To me, getting the lighter weight without giving up board size and cutting power (small saw with big saw attitude) tipped the scale toward the 8-1/2. The shorter fence bothered me at first - I was accustomed to taller fences - but I have not found it to be a problem and I am VERY fussy on cut accuracy.

4155	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Relatively light, seems very well built.  Have used it to cut rebar, all-thread, tubing.  I am comfortable with it, and it is easy to haul around.  Would recommend to others.
2 sets of rods for attaching the edger to your router, the smaller, shorter rods thread into the larger set if you want a really big standoff.
Get one of two of these clamps! They are simple, well made and make your saw much safer. They can be mounted to the saw in a second, and can quickly and securely hold what you are working on. They have a quick release button and a micrometer type fine adjustment for tension. They swing out of the way easily when you don't need them. The rubber foot to hold the work piece is nice and big.
50	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I wanted a simple travel case to protect my Kindle, but I did not like the cost and bulk of most of the cases sold specifically as Kindle cases.  In searching for a simpler alternative, I came across this case, which is designed for the LightWedge booklight.  It fits the Kindle very nicely, providing protection against bumps and scratches.  It's very light weight, very simple, and much cheaper than most Kindle cases.  I know this isn't what it was designed for, but it works great for simple, cheap Kindle protection.

41	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I searched all around for a sticker book for my children, but could only find junky ones, until this.  It is more expensive than any others you will find, but well worth the money.  It is very well-made and spiral bound, with plenty of pages and just the right size.  The pages are categorized for "food stickers", "sports stickers", etc.  For you who grew up in the 80's collecting stickers...just like we had back then.  Perfect place for all of the stickers that come from the doctor, dentist and the slew that come through the mail from Mimi and Papa on a regular basis!
This will be a step up for many folks from the typical household rechargeable "stick" drivers that typically must plug into the wall to recharge, typically taking overnight to do so, only to typically die after just a few 3" x 3/16ths wood screws into an untapped piece of typical southern pine [don't even think poplar].  Milwaukee, for most in the trade, has been and continues to be considered as a manufacturer of first class but no frills tradeline tools.
First thing first, you need to set the depth gauge. Grab a scrap piece of drywall and experiment a little to get it right. Once you have that set, you can hang a sheet of drywall very quickly.
I have cut my granite piece (1" thick) without any hassle.

6463	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	arrived on time.  product exactly as described.  very satisfied.
The new blades were obviously much sharper and things went back to normal once installed. The Amazon price was the lowest I saw and they arrived quickly, although strangely packed in a big torn-up box.
-  Everything folds up into a single compact unit, so there's nothing else to carry or remember to take, and nothing pokes out to get in your way (like the extension rollers on the Rousseau 2950).
362	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works well, nice and bright....No problems...Clip stays on book when clip it. The last one broke, but only after  years...Its worth it...
I found this product when I looked for Kindle 2 accessories.  There is another Mighty Bright clip on light that's specifically for the Kindle, but it costs a bit more.  This works just fine.  It can either clip to the Kindle 2 or the cover.  It's not very heavy - I tested it on a regular paperback, and as long as you put more than 50 pages in the clip, it won't bend the pages.

1642	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Must have for the Porter Cable 7515 Router, it only comes with a 1/2 collet..

3855	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The Bosch 101AO 20 tooth Progressive blade is just the right jig saw blade to cut through hardened acrylic sheets. I just finished building an enclosure around the drivers seat in a Ford E350 passenger bus. We only used one blade to do all the cuts through 1/2 inch sheets. There were a lot of curved cuts and copes to fit the acrylic sheets around the fiberglass bus bulkheads, passenger grab bars and other odd angles. Chucked it up in an old Bosch barrel grip jig saw and these blades provided smooth, straight cuts. No wandering and the cut edges were square. Slow going but problem free.
Variable speed dial.  What a nice touch!  Instead of relying solely on trigger pressure for speed control, Milwaukee thoughtfully provides a speed dial.  Set it to half and you can pull the trigger back all the way and run at half speed.  Demo work doesn't usually involve feathering the trigger, so this is a godsend.
Bottom line, I am going to buy another set as they are worth the extra few bucks over the other brands.
5868	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I like it
6013	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	No question now as to where that tool is hiding.  It is in the tool bucket.  The 27 pockets of the Bucket Boss Stacker Pockets allows you to put the smaller tools on the outside of bucket where they are easy to get at, and the larger tools on the inside where they can be easily accessed.  Nothing is buried where it can't be seen or is "totally lost in the mess".  There are enough pockets for everything, and enough room inside the five gallon bucket to allow everything to have it's proper place.

Another plus is that it will fit the new 890 series so I didn't have to get another fence when I added this router to my collection.
This is a heavy saw, as I noticed when I first hefted it in my hand. The extra weight, compared to my 7-1/2" Craftsman, is due partly to its slightly larger size, but more is due to the much heavier build. The deck is a thick slab of solid metal (not just a stamped piece of sheet metal like on the Craftsman). Other than the cosmetic grip surfaces, it seems that pretty much everything else is metal, and solid metal at that. Lots of cast parts, as opposed to stamped sheet metal parts.
* when you unbox the blades, measure the chipper thicknesses and label them "A", "B", "C", etc., according to the manual.  There one that's thinner than the others, and it is required for certain thickness combinations; identifying it by sight is almost impossible.  I wrote on them in silver Sharpie and it solved that problem.
My first cut with the dado set was through some laminated MDO for a miter track, which is being used as a fence extension on my table saw. I wasn't able to make the required dado in one pass to the size constraints of my saw(13/16"max width) so, I made several smaller passes. To my amazement, the dado was flat bottomed and the edges perfectly square. I can see now why so many folks at my woodworking forum are using, and recommending this blade. It's an excellent choice!!
690	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Not sure if it is the bulbs or my housing units, but I am replacing these way more often than the brand I used previously.  Thank goodness it was a 10 pack.
5513	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I recently purchased the RT-100.  I have some bad news and some good news. Bad news first.  The directions are really frustrating -- mine were photocopies with the left side cut off.  Also, steps in the directions  contradict each other.  I threw the directions against the wall several  times in anger. It uses a set of leveling screws that come up through the  bottom of the table to balance the acryllic insert, and I find it next to  impossible to set them correctly.  As I slide wood across, it gets stuck  where the acryllic meets the table, or it dips suddenly from the infeed  side.  So I go back and re-adjust the leveling screws, but then it's too  high in the front or the back, etc etc etc.  I am using a Bosch 1617EVS  router, which is a light machine, and still it causes the acryllic to bend  and pull a bit. The table does not come with a miter gauge. The acryllic  insert does not seem to be able to accommodate large-diameter bits such as  those for raised-panel doors (horizontal bits) because the hole is just not  large enough. Now the good news.  They have a system of metal dowels that  are inserted into the wood pieces, which accept screws to join the sides  and back of the table together.  This is an excellent, strong system for  joining wood.  I wouldn't mind incoporating such an idea into my  woodworking. I have bought and used a few router tables in the past:  Craftsman, Porter+Cable, etc., and none of them is as solid as this one.  Definitely, the aluminum parts are very nicely made, and the table top is  also very solid.  When it's clamped to a table top, it doesn't move at all,  even when routing long boards.  Also, the adjustable, independent fences  are very nice for setting a zero-clearance cut (but be careful, you can  actually set the fence to hit the router blade!). All in all, I would say  that the company is honestly trying to make a good product.  With a couple  of improvements, I would say this would be top of the line.
1422	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm using these as replacements for 75 watt xenon bulbs. They are just as bright and don't seem that much hotter.
Since I've owned this unit, I've only had to replace the power cord, thats it, and it was in a production shop environment for 3 years.  I have used it in place of a belt sander at times, with an aggressive grit paper, its that good.  Highly recommended for the serious wood worker.
1739	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for thin plywoods and plastics.  Just remember to mount the blade correctly for the rotation of your particular saw.  Made this mistake on my Rockwell.
The quality of cut is excellent--flat bottoms, smooth cutting, and minimal tear-out. I'm quite happy with the purchase, especially at the price I got it for: $175 on Amazon in March 2006.
My experience?...Very satisfied...but I did some customization.
I love the ergonomics of the device. Everything is where you expect it to be, and everything feels incredibly solid as you make your adjustments, lock them down, set your workpiece in, and especially when you are making your cut. There is NO PLAY in the sliding mechanism, nor is there in the miter adjustment or in the bevel adjustment.
  The great thing about pocket hole screws is their convenience, and strength especially when used in pairs. You will find your self using these more and more often. I even use them on straight joinery by drilling with a forstner bit to create a straight pocket, then go right in with the pocket hole screws. Admittedly by using the kreg jig, and getting an angled installation is stronger than going in straight. The angle prevents tugging on just the threads, but rather creates strength by having to pull the angled shaft through the wood. That is a lot stronger except in the rare condition of pressure being exerted at the direct angle of insertion-not likely.
When mounting in the back of the cut, it always got in the way of the riving knife, blade guard, or pawls...
I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust. This captures about half or more of the dust. Overall, though, it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector: a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard, but spews right off the top of the cut.

In summary, this is a great product if your tablesaw arbor threads are long enough to accept the unit(1-3/8" or over).  If not, keep looking.

5153	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm new at building my own shop. I did quite a bit of homework on dust collectors. Just starting it up for the first time wowed me. You could here the power. After a quick connection with a hose and floor sweep it got its first test. After placing the floor sweep in a pile of sawdust and turning it on, it showed what it was all about. Without moving anything the unit picked up the pile and about another 3 feet around the pile. It was incredible just seeing it happen. I was originally looking at the next model down (since its a small home workshop) But have to say that I'm very happy with going with the next level up. I read it in other rewiews and I'll give the same advise. Spend a little more now. Its worth it. The setup took about an hour and was very easy to do. The bags connect very easy without any effort. One final piece of advise: Make sure your ceilings are high enough so you don't have to take the top off to move. Thats my only mistake. An I'm fine with it. Enjoy!!

Granted, I don't use my band saw a lot and I never had a fence on my 14" bandsaw , so I've nothing to compare it to except the Beismeyer on my table saw. It' not as hefty as that, but is sturdy and accurate and for that price I think a good buy.

I am very happy with this purchase, hope it holds up as well as my other Porter Cable tools.

Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
9143	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This is a great tool that I use all the time. Being able to nail with one hand while holding the wood with the other is great. Not having an air hose is much easier. It is [priced well] to operate. Only drawback is that it miss fires occasionally and seems to do it a bit more after cleaning which is not what I expected.

4194	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I'm very pleased with the way this dado set is working out.  I was concerned with using an 8" stack with a 1-1/2 hp delta contractors saw, but so far it's working out great--even with all the blades installed.  I don't have any experience with other dado stacks, but to my eye the cuts from the SD508 are superb.  Clean, flat bottoms and sides.  No chip out at all.  The only thing that is a hassle (not unique to Freud) is that it IS a dado stack.  Putting the both cutters and the chippers together for a cut can be a chore.  Now I know why Bill Hylton says avoids using a dado stack in favor of using a router to make dados in some of his books.  :-)

The owner of the house is EXTREMELY happy with the install...  For $50 this tool is WELL worth it.  Even if you are just using it one time for yourself -- you can use it and turn around and re-sell it.  The time I saved justified the purchase no question....  Thanks AMAZON!


Anyway I have a 12amp sawzall with a variable speed orbital cut (1 + 1/8th) and the sawzall was up to the job. Given these blades, there is not much that will stop you.
Relate to the massive weight tolerance.
The control handle is ergonomic and very comfortable. Trigger action is smooth and required less effort than other saws I have used. After taking it out of the box on a deck renovation, the first thing I noticed is the large-size and relative light weight of this saw. Upon reaching for the left-hand guide handle, I see that it is attached to the aluminum base of the tool, rather than the motor assembly. This is a detail unique to Milwaukee products and allows for more balanced handling of the tool. The left hand guides the base of the saw... confidence inspiring.

Then I set the side to side screw followed by the front to back screw.  Tomorrow I will make the thin kerf initial cut.  My 2nd or 3rd hand Delta 36-640 contractor saw table did not come with a riffing knife, blade guard or splitter (replacement parts are also discontinued).  I may have found a suitable substitution riffing knife so with safety in mind this is a huge step forward for me.  Some projects will have to wait until I get the riffing knife / splitter issue resolved (no ripping).  I would recommend this item, it is high quality.

learned my lesson
2658	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	this is avery exact stand for the saw. well made,very exact in its fitting together .if only others would do also.
It's most useful when you want to sink the screw right after you've drilled and then go on to drill the next hole, etc.  It wouldn't add that much efficiency if you're drilling a lot of holes one after the other, and then going back to set all the screws.
I love Paslode tools and have nothing real bad to say about this nailer.

5929	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Another 745 user.  This works very well with the usual caution about the spliter.  I use a lot of 1x1 molding pieces for making recessed lattice panels but in pt wood you can only get 1x2 so i use my saw to split them and this helps a lot with spots that may be thinned out due to bark or knots.  Also allows me to carefully shave down other material for making shims and what not.
4024	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I've had great luck with Dewalt tools so I figured I would pay a little extra to get something heavy-duty and will last a long time.  It meets my expectations but be forewarned, when other reviewers say this thing is heavy, they mean it (I'm 6'2", 230 lbs and I work out).  It's definitely overkill for my light-duty, around the house applications but I have no complaints.
6922	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Sorry, I couldn't resist! Anyway, I have a walk-out basement on a fairly steep sloping lot. Before I got this attachment I had to take a hand axe and cut a depression in the ground for one leg of the ladder every time I wanted to do something. I have a natural wood lap siding that needs to be resealed every few years so you can imagine the kind of fun I've been having. Not only does this thing do everything as advertised, you'll find that the strength of your ladder is degraded little, if any. Top quality construction. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend purchasing to anyone.

3573	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Weve used these for a long time at work, as a buffer and as a sander with an 8" pad. I work on fiberglass, and buff on gel coat. This is one of the best tools out there for removing caked up anti-fouling on boats, and all kinds of composite fillers. It doesn't bog down like air tools do.  The key to longevity with these buffers is to blow them out with compressed air once you're finished sanding, and I've never had any issue with them by just simply buffing.  Only time we've had to replace them is when one was dropped and the output shaft bent. We tried several other options because we were strapped for cash at the time, but none of them lasted a full year, kind of a shame too, because it wouldn't have been much more to just buy one of these.

2054	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	No complaints at all.  Fits my Makita RT0701CX7 like it was meant for it.  I also purchased the adapter to use in the plunge base. I think the finish could be more refined but they work. The box they come in will probably not survive long though.

The point is that I put a page from the coloring book on a clipboard so I have a solid surface then attach the light to the clipboard.  I'm partially paralized so this works great for me.  Wish I'd found it sooner.  Definitely 5 stars.

A buddy used mine for rounding, profiling and chamfering ALL the lumber on his fancy Teak deck-project; a job that would KILL most routers. It came back rarin' to chew more lumber, even though he ate-up two solid carbide bits!
Just do your homework if you intend to add to existing run.....

9742	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Smallest bit broke rather quick but i just replaced the fine tip bit with a standard bit. The important part of this is the base the bit goes into that does the countersinking and that works perfect. I don't use the 2 larger bits very often because they make too big of holes for the screws I use. Deducting a star for the fragility of the fine tip bit.

This an excellent purchase.
5772	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The title of this review says it all.  These blades have a separate set of teeth that cut each side of the kerf.  You can actually end up with cuts that don't need sanding!  These cut through everything I have tried them on  like butter.  They are particularly good on plywood.
3076	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I'd buy and adjustable base that didn't require cutting wood components if the price was similar.  Changing to a bigger size means back to base one (as it were).
2334	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great for the price. I didn't pay more than what I got. It does the job. If you ask for more from this product, you should be looking at the price point up. Lots nicer products are available, at a lot higher cost. Happy to add this little guide to my router collection.

4856	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The reviews on this belt sander were dead on reliable. If it suffers from anything, it would be its weight. But I purchased this sander because of how well it was rated by others, and I am not in the least disappointed.

So I chop it out of the package and think the cast iron surfaces are coated with cosmolene, got the kerosene out and washed it.  Nope it's not coated, the cast iron is just that rough.
I also read complaints that the battery cover was difficult to remove.  Perhaps they fixed the design. I had no problem removing it or putting it back.

hard white oak so smoothly without chipping. I started a project with a set of raised panel doors and a economy set of bits, the bits fried ,tore up the lumber and were dangerous. When these bits came in, the job became much easier and less dangerous. I highly recommend the 2+2 cutters, the extra cutters realy help. These are quality bits, given good care they should last for years. The CD included gives a good overview on how to use them properly.

6919	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	You'll appreciate the soft start especially when working at high grind speeds.  That alone would justify the additional cost of this vs. a standard grinder.

The position of  the front handle makes sense -- it is up higher than the front of the  machine, so you get a good position relative to the sanding surface.  The  handle is also designed to give you a lot to grab onto.

  Additionally, this polisher is available at the Makitatools.com site with the side handle only instead of the wrap around handle. The part number on that one is 9227CY. Since the side handle is available as an option, I chose to go with this one, and pick up the handle, to keep all options open.

So - I really like this saw.  If there was a 4.5 star option, I'd go with it.  If it was less or came with accessories (other than that dust bag), I'd give it 5.
9239	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	paslode battery works just like it is suppose to what more can you say. the local box stores are not carrying this product anymore. The TX heat of our trucks is rough on batteries stored in our boxes.

The light is bright and I love that it has 2 settings.  The toggle switch is on the back of the head and really easy to use.  It's an intuitive place to put it as well since you can naturally adjust the positioning at the same time you turn the light on.

7194	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I am not a flooring professional.  I laid my floor with a carpenter.  Personally I've never used a manual nailer, but he says it's a major back saver, which when you do the math (20-30lbs versus 4lbs of hammering pressure) makes a lot of sense.  As to tongue splitting, lower the pressure (the stapler works great with my tiny and very light senco compressor) and--does it really matter?  You can get really close to the wall, which means very little face nailing.

3905	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The multimaster is a great tool but the blades are a real disappointment.  Bought a set of these even higher priced blades with the expectation that they would last longer and went through two of them in a matter of hours.  The teeth are just weak and wear out or break off easily.  I was doing nothing more than cutting 2x4's and some 3/4" pine subfloor and 1/3 of the teeth just broke off on one and the other dulled so quickly that it just started burning through the wood.  So much for spending more.  These blades need to drop in price by a lot or be re-engineered for reliability and longevity.
7878	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Beleive it ! I can't say enough how useful this tool really is. It is absolutely the thinnest prybar available. Where it really stands out is getting behing delicate moldings without damage. Yet it's so tough , you can stand on it with your full weight and it won't deflect one tiny bit. It's designed so that when prying ,just a little force turns into some major leverage. Have you ever had trouble pulling a finish nail or one without a head? No more. A tap with a hammer is all you need to get a firm grip on the shank of any nail with the super sharp jaws. It also works very well at scraping paint,concerete,glue,grout,caulking,wood,plastic,ice , whatever is on it that you wish wasn't. I've used them to lift drywall into place. The list goes on and on and continies to grow every day. The bottom line is this. You need this tool. Everyone who sees mine wants one , so you might want to order 2 or 3 or 30.

it to the moisture of the pine, it was easy to see that the pine would contract after installation (and using Hoadley's formula, to compute the magnitude of the changes - in this case the wood was more moist than the existing wood in my house, so I knew that it was going to shrink by about 1/16, so I took care to jamb the tongue and groove planks tightly together. Had the situation been the reverse, I would have left a slight gap between the planks.)

Make sure you buy the outfeed rollers on the back side.  I bought the 36" one and wish I had purchased the 48".  The outfeed rollers are a must, it make working with the saw very painless.  I removed the anti-kickback which does not work, but does leave a mark on the material as it passes over it.  I bought a mobile base which works well.  I do not move this machine often, but when I do, it sure is nice.  For those who say they won't move this machine much, you will, and when you do, you will be thankful you spent the money on the mobile base.
Working surface is laminate (a plus for me), accommodates a router plate for hanging your machine underneath.
167	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Okay at first, for about a month, then began to flicker and drove me crazy while trying to read on the bus in the morning.  Did not last as long as I anticipated.  Still looking for the utopian little book light.
2129	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Great product but needs some extra attention. I took the advise from other postings and installed a threaded nut on each of the brackets to stop the outfeed supports from moving during transportation of the saw. By installing these threaded nuts it helps lock the product in place either in the open position or closed position.

5006	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	This is a good saw. Its the third one Ive ordered because I keep thinking the next one will have a case.

5564	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Product does what it was intended for and good quality.
6306	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The big benefit to these is that you get true mobility out of them. While holding a piece of work, lined up, in one hand, you use these quick grips in the other hand to secure the work. If it slips while clamping, it is still a one handed tool to release it, and reclamp it again. Enables you to maintain a professional flow to your work. I feel awkward when using regular clamps in comparison. They require two hands. You could use a spring clamp to hold it together, then get another clamp to give it a final hold, but the quick grip saves you from having to do that.

1790	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I will buy it again

As is obvious, Milwaukee did not dicontinue this drill.  A Milwaukee rep told me that dealers went into such an uproar, that Milwaukee decided to keep this beauty available.  I wish I loved all my tools as much as I love this drill.  Buy one!
I don't think you'll be disappointed if you put one of these to work in your shop.  You'll wonder how you ever worked without it.

9339	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Dead on Arrival, except I didn't know that until the first time I used it. The top bit holder piece separated  from the shank piece.  Disgusted.  I was using the Rapid Loader in a brand new Dewalt Drill /Driver.

3572	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this stand for my belt/disc sander and it fits perfectly.  I also discovered it is just right for my bench top drill press so I purchased another.  Nice and sturdy with convenient storage underneath.
4821	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I use these in my Delta Platinum Edition Contractors Saw.  They work very well.  Just put them in place, adjust the leveling screws, move the fence over them (not over the blade though) and slowly raise your blade through it.  Pretty easy.  Wish the price was cheaper.

4945	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	excellent set, worth every penny
3000	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have had this sander for the last year. It has been a true godsend as it is used almost every day for two to three hours. The dust collection piece is great until you get up to the 220 grit which seems to somehow escape the collector. My only gripe is the palm area will heat up after about an hour or so enough to make it somewhat uncomfortable. However, it does the job right everytime.


All the saws and arbors are in one blow molded case. The case is a little heavy, but at least you won't be searching for loose saws. They all stack within one another and it is easy to get to the size you need quickly.

1946	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I bought my first one of these sanders about 9 years ago.  I use it all the time.  It does an excellent job, is solidly built, and above all it doesn't make my hand and arm tired.  I have a small wood working business on the side and I'm in the garage working usually every other weekend. I eventually wore my first sander out; I think it was the bearings that started to go.  I contemplated changing them out but for $89.00 it's almost disposable at that point.  I did however hang on to it just in case I wanted to have it rebuilt as a back up. My second one is still going strong.  The reason I went with the Porter cable in the first place is because I'm still using the 1/2 pad sander my father purchased in 1952.  For the most part you can't beat a Porter Cable.
2981	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	We keep two of these in the house, and one in each car.

7174	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	What else would you expect but quality?  This is my first time making a set of doors.  They came out perfect.  The setup is easy if you follow the instruction video or the paper they give you.  I found it a must, to make a router table sled for doing the rails.  I bought the phenolic sheet and a grizzly clamp off of Amazon.  They got delivered fast and made it a lot easier. It prevents the back of the wood from blowing out.  Make sure to check the speeds on your router.  The back cutter feature makes the set even nicer.
So I finally get setup, I grab my "test" piece of scrap.  Clamp it down (btw the table is WAY too short!  I could only use one of the clamp arms) and start to drill.  At the point where I felt I was forcing things I started to back off, and the entire piece of wood came up with the cutter.  ALL the clamps failed: the "hold fasts", the guide, AND the lock holding the chisel in place!  Four different failures, all on the first cut.  No thanks!  Returned immediately.
6005	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	perfect fit

6518	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Good quality, works perfectly with my Incra finger joint tool. You really need to hold each panel tight & straight. The small size is perfect and the handsscrew action is perfect.
4078	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Had one of these that lasted over 20 years of intermittent use in my farm shop.  When it finally gave up the ghost, I naturally ordered another.  I hope this one lasts as long.  Good machine.
6678	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	Pretty poor and weak tool.  "Might be good to hold a lid on a box of sweaters," but any real work?  Nah.  Can't apply more than a few ounces pressure and the plastic or rubber contacts will slip easily off of everything I've tried.. wood metal, plastic, etc.  Pretty much a waste of money.  I'd give it less stars if I could.
838	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I got these for my tart melters.  I wasn't sure about wattage, but the one in one of my burners doesn't heat the tart enough to throw the scent, so I ordered these 35 watt, which are brighter.  They work great!

7474	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	We use the biesmeyer ones at work and there rock solid. I got this one thinking it would be a nice alternative and save some money. Well like the old saying goes you get what you pay for. The cursors are extremely magnified and it's really hard to determine where your at on the tape, the build quality seems ok it all bolts together where as the biesmeyer has some components welded and seem to engage much easier and tighter. I plan to replace this one with a rockler flip stop or get biesmeyer stop. It works, but would not recommend it.
2766	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This saw is really nice and heavy duty.  Wish the blade was more aligned with the base guides but I was expecting this after reading other reviews.
The one thing to keep in mind with this tool, even if you have used another biscuit jointer in the past, is that you will never be able to use it consistently and correctly without reading the manual.  I'm as guilty as anyone when it comes to using a tool directly out of the box, but It makes a huge difference when you really know how to use and adjust a piece of equipment like this.  Take the extra 15 minutes, read the manual, and you will enjoy this great piece of machinery for years to come.  Several of the complaints you will see listed in various reviews are due to simply not knowing how to correctly operate the unit.  My father has the more expensive Porter Cable model, and finds this one superior to it.  Look around on amazon and you may be able to save even more money by purchasing the less expensive reconditioned model that carries the same warranty!
7723	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Good quality, will be a hand down to my son.
2: I needed a slighty heavier duty "small hand drill" size of drill.
 Inserting the bits into the chuck- it is not as easy as the "twist" that is standard with most of the cordless models, but it still is not difficult.
7138	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used the freud blades for a long time and I have to say, this blade blows them away!
3476	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	These stops work on more saws than what is listed. I put them on a DW713, 10 inch saw. They screw into a 1/4" - 20 threaded hole on each side of the table. As stated in other reviews some saws take a clip to fasten under the saw. The stops on my saw max out at 3 7/8" fron the fence. The stops are larger and heavier than they appear in the photo.
If you have lots of screws to take out and put back in, this tool will keep the blisters at bay!  It ought to be great on sheet metal, too.
You can't go wrong with this purchase.

7637	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I bought a Makita Hammer Drill and Dewalt scaling chisel bit for various projects involving repairs and maintenance of concrete structures around my house.  I had no previous experience with hammer drill or chisel tool but I have done many DYI's around the house to be able to handle this new tool in my collection.  I used this recently to strip the cement/stucco patches from the steps in front of my house using this tool.  It took nearly 4 hours to completely strip all the cement coating from 5 raisers.  In my opinion, it would have been a very tough job without this tool. I have summarized the pros and cons of this chisel below.
We have a car charger for longer car trips, and for household emergencies when recharging on AC isn't an option.
The replacements came quickly.  I love these things-  Just ordered two more .  (for a total of 6 now)  They are the perfect gift that "keeps on giving"....at the right price!  And easy to replace bulbs/batteries.  Highly recommended!
9186	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I have used these batteries before.  This price was much better than at the hardware store.
2252	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Love Dewalt.
Tried alert Amazon of a significantly lower price for several days and get them to better/match the lower price that included free (zero) shipping on this exact same saw with carry case - from a large box home improvement center's website - but Amazon apparently would not do drop their price. So we were forced to vote with our wallet and purchase there. We like Amazon and Amazon Prime but they clearly dropped the ball here...
I haven't yet used to blade and bit product, but if  it is as good as the other two items, this bundle is a winner.

2299	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	So far I have used this saw to cut up to 3/8" Baltic Birch plywood and up to 1/2" maple, black walnut and alder.  In all cases the saw worked flawlessly.  Granted I am not a seasoned "scroller" and probably wouldn't have purchased this saw had I not met my max level of frustration with my Ryobi scroll saw and it's penchant for pinned saw blades.  In any case I am glad I purchased this saw and so far I am very happy with it.  Absolutely no vibration.  I have it sitting on a workbench with a couple of clamps on the front tabs where bolts would go.  Due to storage issues I chose to forego the dedicated stand.

 - more space between the drive wheel and the wheel housing.  I am a rookie with belt sanders and was not managing the position of my power cord properly. About an hour into my project I snagged the power cord and wrapped the cord around the drive wheel of the sander.  I was able to get the cord free of the drive wheel without damaging anything but with extreme difficulty.  I now operate the tool with the power cord over my shoulder in order to keep the cord above the sander and off the work surface.  I also keep the extension cord behind me and away from the sander at all times.
If there was 6 stars I would give it a 6.
4789	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	The cast aluminum base had a hump in the casting 90 degrees to the plunge travel.  Don't expect to get good results with a tool that references the base to a flat surface when the tool rocks back and forth on its base.  Yes the issue can be resolved with enough elbow grease.  Just apply spray contact adhesive to the back side of coarse grit sandpaper,and stick it to the flat surface of a cast iron jointer table.  Then rub it flat, and reattach the somewhat less than sturdy aluminum base plate.  I just don't like having to do makeshift finishing work on a poorly manufactured tool.  And no, I didn't send it back for an exchange (not purchased from Amazon).  It only took the better part of one day to flatten the base.  It would have taken two weeks for an exchange, which may or may not have been from the same production run with the same exact issue.  Who knows?

By the way, if you experience a lot of noise, the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise.

Since I bought it to replace an Estwing hammer that's been by my side for around 15 years, I can testify to what marvelous hammers they are.  I have tried other tradies tools and while a few other top brands come close, this one is well and truly the pack leader.

1795	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could purchase the identical sander as the one I purchase 25 years earlier because I burned it up from much use. I was going to switch to another brand, and ended up sticking to this one because of how slick the paper holder works. It doesn't have those wire springs that can be painful on tired fingers. It uses a "key" to open a spring held brace that secures the sandpaper on either end. My old one never loosened under 25 years of use. I also save money by purchasing the larger single sheet paper and cutting them into quarters. I also never replaced the pads because they were so durable. I used to snag and rip the paper on splinters but the pad wore very little. This sander is not as light as most on the market, but I feel that it aids in sanding because it adds the pressure you need to do the job. The motor doesn't bog down very much with heavier pressure. The weight of the sander also helps to keep the sander in place and not jump around on the object. The cord is very heavy and the overall sander looks and feels very commercial. The grip is great even for my small hands. This review is written by a woman.
8214	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I finally broke down and spent the money on this protractor. It works great. Wished I had bought it earlier. Easy to use.

This guide is more substantial. It has larger contact surfaces, great adjustment and some weight which helps you maintain control of the router. I don't feel that it's awkward weight, just something substantial that helps control the tool.
6109	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Works well. Wish it had a better seal to the garbage can. Sure makes emptying the sawdust easy. I added a grounding wire from the 4" hose to the metal garbage can.
Amazon needs to get on the ball with these counterfeit items. I had a similar experience with a belkin USB cable, where it was supposed to be belkin, yet the cable was absolute garbage, extremely generic and anorexicly thin.
This is an ideal tool-upgrade for the dedicated woodworker with a 2 to 6 thousand-dollar cabinet saw. (Powermatic, Saw-Stop, General, Steel-City or top Taiwanese saws.)

The chief reason most of us would buy one of these routers is to use it under a router table. In my opinion, the best way to do that is to mount the motor in a router lift device. This enables you to adjust the router height from above the table, without lifting the router and router plate out of the table top (They're heavy and the handles nearly fill the opening, making removal awkward!) or struggling to work under the table. I recommend a router lift that can raise the collet above the table top to simplify bit changes. My choice was the Jointech SmartLift Digital. The JessEm Mast-R-Lift also raises the collet above the table, but I've never used it.

6653	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	Simple to use, and very low cost. It is made of plastic so I am not sure how strong it really is, but for the uses I employ, it works excellent.
If you don't have a drill press, you should probably go with 7/16" on the holes to allow for a little misalignment (except for the two holes on the corner for the rubber feet.

This smaller diameter hose makes it so that you can reach long distances without pulling the vacuum into the side of your paint job. This is a perfect accesory for your shop vac.
It does have one downside. It rings like a bell on every strike. I usually wear noise blocking (like earplugs, not active noise canceling) earbuds when doing construction and I can hear that ring on every strike. I assumed that it was just easier to hear with the earphones in, but after taking them out, I found the ringing to be pretty loud. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it rings with the all steel construction.

8613	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	This hammer is fantastic! Ive been a carpenter fir over 20 years and this is the best trim hammer I have ever owned. Its a little shorter than the 16 oz hammer I believe which makes it nice because it doesnt bang on you're legs as much when its hanging from tool bag.
  I have left them on at times...and after a couple of hours...turned it off. It was still burning pretty bright. For what its worth...I have been using the Sanyo Enerloop rechargable AAA batteries...and it works fine with those batteries (even though they are 1.2 volts and not 1.5 volts each)
9539	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Works, no complaint.
Be it basic around the house light work, trim work, or heavy nailing, the 16 oz will do it. I highly recommend to anyone wanting a great quality, American made hammer.
It is also a bargain because it does not have the "new and improved" features that so many neophytes seem to crave. I've seen "boutique" hammers that cost well over $200. That's ridiculous when you consider what a hammer does. Some newfangled hammers claim to develop greater head speed because of aerodynamic design. Bull. Test those hammers for yourself to see whether or not they actually drive nails any better. Some have special magnetic holders for nails that allow you to put the nail into the holder, then drive it into the wood with one blow without holding it in your other hand. That is supposed to make nailing faster... Well. have you TRIED THAT?
5039	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	1.0	I really like my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw, and got this bag for it when I started using the saw in my garage shop (as opposed to outdoors projects) for dust control. It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it. I would say the dust capture is 20% at best.

4442	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	NEG	2.0	Bought it to throw into my helper's tool bag. Definetly not for precision work. Lock is flimsy, blade is thin, takes a lot of effort to set the blade depth to just where you want it. If you want a real block plane, go Veritas or Lie Nielsen!
Contrary to the description, I don't think that this model is equipped with soft start - the saw starts with a loud bang! The motor is also deafeningly loud, which came as a surprise, given that Makita's circular saws run pretty quiet. Good hearing protection is a must.

But then came the "precision fence".  When I unpacked that box, I was just plain p*ss*d off.  Instead of being assembled, and lacking only attachment to the table and perhaps a little setup, what I found was a box of parts.  Not assemblies to bolt together.  Just parts.  Kreg does not build precision fences.  Kreg sells parts kits for people who would like to build their own precision fence.  Which might be okay, if they said that loud and clear in their marketing materials.  But they don't.  They tell you that you are buying a fence.  Not a box of bits and pieces.

800	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	The first time I purchased replacement bulbs for my under-the-cabinet lights - they cost 2 for 9 bucks at Home Depot. I have 6 lights - so that's 27 bucks. And for some reason, those lights only lasted a month. I just let all of the light bulbs blow out and never replaced them b/c it was too expensive. Amazon has become my go-to place to find weird stuff at a bargain - and low and behold one night I decided to look for them here - and I found them. The EXACT lights - but more than a 2-pack! It's been 2 months. They are still working and have the same brightness the expensive bulbs have. And this is why I love Amazon.
  Pertaining to the 6 or 12, I chose the 6 first because I saw that one being used in higher end woodworking books. Authors even photographed themselves using the starret setting up the table saw blade for example. When I got it my first impression was, boy is that tiny. It probably will be the one that I use the most. I just don't want to be limited when I need to use one on lengths greater than 6 inches.

  Pocket hole joinery is a nice addition to your arsenal. You will find yourself incorporating it more and more into your projects, and the Kreg system is the best. Highly recommended.
I overcame the problem by building a frame for it out of plywood, and using a bungee strap secured to eyes mounted in the plywood to hold the entire setup down. Now the lid won't fall off, the bucket won't fall over, and I can wheel the thing around. For good measure I mounted my micro shop vac to the side, so I've effectively got a portable vacuum cleaner with built in separation so I hardly ever fill the little shop vac. It's also handy because I can run the micro shop vac and my table saw at the same time and still come in just under 20A, so I can run them both off one double receptacle.
8473	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Awesome dado stack at a reasonable price. Lots of possible configuration for precision dados. Comes with 2 outside cutter blades, 3 chippers, 3 spacers and a variety of thin shims in a range of thicknesses. I bought this to use on my SawStop pro and it fits great. If you have a Sawstop you need the dado brake and you will need to adjust the spacing every time you switch back and forth, which is not a huge hassle after you do it a few times. This would be the case with this saw and any dado stack. I like the blade holder it comes with. Make sure to hold on to the paper that comes with it because it shows you how many blades, spacers, shims, etc you need to achieve a give width of cut. Make sure none of the carbide tips are touching and are staggered when you install the stack so as to not chip any of the carbide teeth. My only complaint is that there are no detailed instructions on how to use a dado stack so if you are a beginner and never used one before I recommend watching some youtube videos.

One of the nicest aspects of it is that it is so clean and simple - just air pressure pushes the back end of the tube and nothing really gets caulk on it.  It's best if you have your pressure regulator (you really need one for this tool) near where you're working so you can fine-tune delivery as necessary.
2925	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	I have owned this saw for a couple months. I have played with it enough to get a feel for it but I have not worked with it enough to be an expert.

6152	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	4.0	So I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't figure it would have the performance of thien baffle as its a simple stamped plastic lid. To my surprise it works pretty darn well. Id say it stops 90-95% of the sawdust. My dust collector is very slowly adding material but I have a trashcan that is just about full. With the vacuum on, the lid stays sealed tight against the trashcan
  All of my gripes are very minor.  This product is clearly a 5 star.  It is constructed very well.  All the pieces have a very solid feel.  The bottom line is that you can make very accurate chop cuts without much effort.
3) The router plate gets screwed down with 2 screws only (from the top), in opposite corners.  If for some reason the plate ends up sticking up in a corner without a screw, there is no way to make it flat.
2.  Attaching to the side of my drill press - Basically the magnet would not hold the light in this position.  Only if I flexed the neck so the lamp itself hung straight down would it even hold itself to the side of the drillpress - and then it was so wobbly that I was afraid to turn on the press for fear that the light would slide right off...
The quality is good. It is resistant to oil and contaminates. It cleans up easily. No kinking problems at all, as some hoses are so flimsy.

6817	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Everyone know that Rigid makes excellent equipment. These 18" pipe  wrenches are no exception. They are lightweight and durable. I was a field  engineer working on industrial furnaces for a while and trying to carry all  of the tools you need everywhere you go can be quite cumbersome to say the  least.
4838	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	If having a red insert is important to you you might have to look elsewhere- the two I received are both a powder/cornflower-y blue. Made no difference to me; the inserts themselves fit my unisaw perfectly, the leveling screws easily brought it to dead level and I get zero tearout. Bought one for my dado stack and one for my thin kerf, but might shell out for a couple more. Much better than a shopmade insert and cheap enough to forgo the effort. But...not red.
I highly recommend these blades to all finish carpenters and woodworkers.  They are top notch and this is a very good price!
I went to my local Sears that happened to stock all three saws and compared them. First thing was that the Milwaukee came with a case which I was looking for , and once you put the three saws side by side, the Milwaukee just had great features.
It worked great and I never had any problems with it.  The depth settings worked great and the tightening screw held tight, so no problems with the depth changing on me.  The deck I used this on was large and I used a hard brazilian wood so this received a lot of rugged use, and held up fine.

8405	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Pamper your power tools...they deserve it.  Buy at least 12/3 for your short runs, and 10/3 for longer than 50' and for higher draw (over 10 amps) tools.  This is especially true for air compressors, table/miter saws, etc. If you've ever experienced your power tools bogging down, try a better (heavier gauge) cord, you might be surprised.  As mentioned, the lighted cord end when it's plugged in is handy/cool, as well.


I then disassembled the parts and started assembling it directly to the table. The pieces have a lot of adjustment built in by using slotted holes, so as long as you get the 4 holes drilled in the right place on the table saw, you can get it aligned. Precise alignment (as suggested in the original instructions) was not needed. You do have to be careful though to align at least one slot for your miter/cross-cut slide. I don't need both channels, but if I did I could cut out a section of the stationary table top with my router.

4868	Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5	POS	5.0	Bought this belt sander over a year ago.  Principal use has been to prepare sub-flooring for installation of 3/4" oak. That required removal of significant irregularities and this sander certainly ate up the high spots quickly.  Have also been using it to prepare the new unfinished oak surface for finishing.  Again, it is up to the task.  Yeah, I know renting a floor sander would make the job quicker, but I am doing the job in increments and find I can sand with this sander much faster than I could install the flooring in the first place. This machine produces little felt vibration and is well balanced and its ergonomic design let me use it with little fatigue.  I'm collecting the dust in a bucket under a dust deputy and am amazed how fast the bucket is filling up.  Some of the dust will be mixed with the urethane finish to use as filler in the narrow cracks between boards caused by uneven expansion/contraction of the wood.  I use Walkers Game ears for hearing aids and their sound compression feature advertised to reduce muzzle blast works to reduce the 84 dB sound of the sander.  It is comfortable to use and quickly smooths out irregularities.  I do not use the dust bag.  Shop vac pulls almost all the dust into the dust deputy and I have not yet had to clean the filter or empty the vac. It took a while to locate dust hose fittings to fit the dust port but I managed to cobble together a system that works.  My principal criticism of Makita and all other dust machine makers is that the dust collection hoses, and hose fittings are not standardized and the actual dimensions of such fittings are almost never given.  I would love to see it mandatory that all such product descriptions include an accurate inside diameter and outside diameter of the fitting.  Looks to me like this field is an opportunity for pvc pipe fitting manufacturers to expand their market by offering pvc pipe fittings that would fit dust ports on all dust collecting products.
