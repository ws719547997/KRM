9804	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I occasionally dabble in reupholstering furniture, so a good staple gun is a must. And frankly, a "good" staple gun is hard to come by. I have been through three in the past two years. They either jam up, fly apart, or won't shoot a staple into anything harder than a sofa cushion. So, my expectations for this gun were pretty low. I have come to view them all as "disposable". I don't know how long this one will last, but I like the fact that it is made in the USA, and so far, it has performed as promised.
If you just want something that is crafty and looks DIY, then these will do. I was hoping for something professional looking. Good luck friends! ....if anyone happens to find something better, please do let me know.

At the moment it is entirely too small to write any more than a check's worth of info, and the chrome grip makes it as hardhard to hold as a pen made of ice. The pen wouldbe worth the price if not for its total lack of converter. Not only is this pen too small for even the smallest converters, Cross stated that they have no intention of making one up. Also, good luck finding cartridges when the slim size isn't sold locally.

It's about as simple as it gets as to mouse pads, but yet its all I need and personally I feel Belkin got it all right.  It's the perfect size and shape for me,. and, the gel pad is has been flattened at the top now, as opposed to the rounded type that I see on many of them.  The flattened style has the gel part coming in contact with more of your wrist and is even more comfortable and supportive...(The rounded gel pads eventually flatten with use anyway.  This one just gets it right from the start).  Also, even though there are some reviews that talk about its "compatibility" with an optical mouse, I have used nothing but optical mice for years and never even knew there was any form of compatibility with a mouse pad, good or bad.  In any event, I have had no problems and my mouse works perfectly on it...

I could be wrong, but I think the idea is to bridge physical notebook users into the digital realm. Many people love to take notes on paper. With mixed text and sketching, it's really difficult to duplicate the efficiency of taking notes on a laptop or portable device. There are times when you're mainly typing, and that is highly efficient, but there's just something about writing it down that is satisfying. But then you have a digital world, as well. How to get those notes into Evernote for safekeeping, tagging, and later retrieval? In this case, you simply take your note(s) and using Evernote's built-in page camera feature, snap a shot of the page. It then gets imported into Evernote and is synced across your devices.

5235	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	If you are a project manager, this notebook is for you. If you are a "free thinker" (aka you can't be boxed in with lines and boxes when you record your notes and ideas), go for one of the many other moleskine selections better for you. This notebook wasn't for me because I am not a project manager and have terrible note-taking styled. I opted for the graph paper notebooks and love them. (At least they keep my writing looking neater!)
7986	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This is an awesome calculator, it has loads of functions
3299	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love that these letters are much thicker and more opaque than most. I've bought others that once you get them on the wall you can't see them. These you absolutely can.
5563	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's handy to have a tiny notebook sometimes -- something more sturdy than a tiny memo pad, but smaller than a traditional moleskine. This is the answer to that problem.
Yes, you can find fancier journals, but you won't find a journal you're more likely to take everywhere and always have on you when good ideas spring to mind. Authors, inventors, artists, theoretical mathematicians, and other obsessive or creative thinkers should never be without one of these. Highly recommended!
I can't tell you how much fun this calendar is.  As a bonus, on the back of each day there is THE DAILY EXTRA which cites quotes, words of wisdom, puzzles, household tips, etc.  So, actually, you are getting two treats each day.

4081	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I had been looking for a large polka dots embossing folder for my Grand Calibur for when I make half fold cards.  This puppy absolutely fit the bill.  Not only is it massive in size, you get two beautifully polka dot designs in one folder.  I've only had my Grand Calibur for a few months now, but I'm thrilled with it.  I get clean, beautifully cut and embossed designs with one pass.  I recently bought some very intricate Christmas dies, which required two passes to get a clean cut, but less intricate dies have only required one.  Be advised that this folder requires the raspberry (D) spacer/adapter plate.  Really looking forward to using this folder for my Christmas cards.  LOVE my Amazon Prime account!  Free shipping and the orders come SUPER fast!

1640	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have four packets in different styles now and have given them as gifts.  I love them.  My friends love them.  Very helpful is the arrow on the back for marking a specific page if need be.
2557	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Great map in very stylish colors from NG. The only reason I give it 4 out 5 is that laminating plastic is little bit thin so when I stick it nails, it tore further up so I had to keep it tension free.
Because it's essentially steel that's been wrapped in silicone, it's also very heavy duty... as such, I've also used it to smash up roasted chickpeas, even avocados.
2501	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The colors are excellent and there are a good amount of cities listed.  I'm using it on a wall in my den to glance at if someone mentions where they live.  I'm only giving a star off because the lamination is so thin. However, maybe that's good because so far I just have it stuck up with scotch tape.

5203	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Moleskines live up to the hype.  The size of the hardcover pocket notebook is perfect, the journal opens flat, the pages are a DREAM to write on, it feels good in the hand.....(and smells great).  I'm a firm believer that if you love your writing instruments (both pen and paper), you will write more.  A good writing setup inspires and lends focus.
1928	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for our home library. We bought these along with library cards for loaning out books. Great for craft projects, too.
4599	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We used these on onesies for a baby shower and they worked really well! Great variety of designs.
9603	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	The hand rest is sort of comfortable, but it doesn't conform to your hand shape. Reason: This is not gel. It has foam inside it. I didn't like the pad all that much, so I cut it open and well, there was foam inside it. Belkin, please don't lie that this is gel. It's not. I have uploaded two pictures of the pad. One of them shows the material inside the hand rest, which is clearly foam.

4268	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've been keeing a journal for years.  When I needed a new one, I bought this one.  It has a clear plastic sleeve/book jacket to protect it.  The pages are lined with a scripture verse on the bottom.  The top has a small line near the top of the page for either date or topic.  I write quite a bit, so I may use two pages and the topic line looks a bit odd just hanging there empty.  Otherwise it's a nice journal.
1124	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	If you purchase a Catholic Catechism, you have to get these tabs!!! There are tabs for each of the major sections, so you can navigate the book with ease. You will be the envy of all your friends when they see you quickly opening your Catechism to a section while they fumble through it hoping to find the table of contents to find the section and pages they are looking for. (If you know someone who has a catechism, these tabs make an awesome gift.) I do alot of bible studies and I need to be able to access my support materials and info quickly. These tabs really help me find things fast! The one piece of advice I must give anyone who purchases the Catechism tabs, or Bible tabs, is DO NOT just start sticking the tabs on the pages. If you do, you may end up with a messed up tabbing system. You want to be sure to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. If you do that and use the tab line up template guide that is provided, your tabs will be perfect. Even if it seems weird to start from the back of the book or whatever it tells you to do, just go with it. It will work perfectly. (It's an exercise in faith! ha ha) Once your tabs are in your Catechism will be accessible and your searching time will be greatly reduced!

I received a discount when buying this set, for my honest, unbiased opinion. Of course it seems as though any review written after getting a discount would be biased, however, I can assure you that I do not hold back when giving my opinion. I read reviews before buying, too. I hope this was helpful to you.

4080	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff. It obsorbs so quickly and you KNOW the hydrocortisone is getting where it needs to be rather being spread all over the clothes and other stuff you hands touch after putting on traditional cream cortisone.
The big plus for me is the amount of pages- no other watercolor journal this size and this quality has as many pages- 36 sheets, 72 pages. There's enough pages to "edit" your work and use pages for things like testing colors, etc without worrying that you are using up precious space/paper. You CAN use the pages front/back, but I tend to just paint on one side and journal a bit on the other side.
4054	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.

It comes in gray and in white and is very high quality. I can't get over the price...$26.99 and free pick up at store!!!! I PROMISE you won't be disappointed! (I hope it's ok that I post this here.

3. Pay attention as you put them on. I was trying to hold a conversation at the same time I was putting these on, and didn't realize I put two tabs in the same position at first. Got about 10 tabs into it before I noticed my mistake. It is possible to remove the tab once it's on, just take it slow and carefully. But better not to have to in the first place.

3440	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Extremely upset. This package did not come with all it said it would. There was a sheet missing or something. I did not receive any days-of-the-week label cards or the number 1. These things are kind of necessary for the calender's use....
My ONLY complaint about the Moleskine Reporter is that it is only available (as far as I've been able to find) in black. So many Moleskine pads are available in a wide range of vibrant colors and it is so much easier for me to misplace small black notepads than ones that are brightly colored. I have lost at least one Reporter partly because its dark profile made it easy not to notice. Please Moleskine, do offer the Reporter in at least ONE bright color (red, orange or yellow would be my choices).
These have a heavy bottom, which helps prevent tipping. I guess they could be better if they were unbreakable and self-refilling, but we don't yet have the technology :)

I've given these out as gifts to my forgetful friends as well though I can't account for how well this works for them, for all I know they might have forgotten where they put this list in the first place. It has a magnet on the back so you can stick it to your fridge which is very convenient and useful.

1380	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These pens are pretty kool.  Has everything a child could want in a scented pen.  And they are child safe.
4349	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are double sided vertical book tabs. They are brightly-colored, multicolored tabs. Easy to apply with the Tab Placement Guide. I would caution you to take your time when applying because if you place the tab crooked, it will stay crooked. The adhesive is excellent and that is a good thing, but you can't pull the tab off and realign it. This will more than likely tear the fragile page. The manufacturer does include two 'practice' tabs so you can learn how to properly apply them (on another piece of paper) before you put them on your beautiful bible pages. Also, bible pages are thin, so be careful that you don't have TWO pages when you put them on.
9295	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Just what I wanted.

Although we haven't tried most of the suggestions, we did flip through it and it's a great book.  It gives enough detail to be valuable for years to come but not so much detail to be overwhelming to a child.  I would think this book will last her until at least age 12.

As you can see plainly, compared to the competition, the Tabbies are strinking & elegant. Their pastel backgrounds compliment the white pages, where the dark competitor's actually make the text hard to read in non-perfect light, and look klunky-almost bolted on. After doing many tabbies sets, I can tell you that the reviews/compliments of those that see them is all positive.

Yes, this is a relatively expensive product but bear in mind that you never regret having the best (at least not once you have finished paying for it).  This roaster is actually a pleasure to clean (and I don't say that lightly).

I searched for another one to replace it, but found one difficult to come by in my area.  So, I decided to buy up and purchased an HP 49G.  What a mistake!

I bought this little pack of three to carry in my handbag. I make notes of websites I want to check out, addresses or phone numbers I need to remember, things i need to add to my "to do" list, and on and on. My memory takes a beating with all the details I come into contact with each day, and it's a relief to me and my poor brain to have a place to jot it down and put it out of my mind until i need the info. These are small, about the size of my hand, and they tuck into a pocket easily. Easily decorated if you like to do art on your notebooks.

1098	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This CD set by Harry and Rosemary Wong is great for the veteran teacher as well as the teacher fresh out of college. The ideas are so simple yet they are so complexed in their delivery and results. Coupled with the classic "The First Days of School", this CD is worth the money and then some. The main idea: You will be effective and sucessful if you develop procedures for your classroom. Tell the students what you want them to do and then model for them how to do it. Ordering this CD allows you to listen to the lecture anytime anywhere:at home, in your car, at work. I highly recommend this for any teacher regardless of years of experience.
4672	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	For years, I've been a devotee of the little Moleskine journals, small books of nice paper (with lines or grids or nothing at all, depending on your preference), bound in a bit of colored oaktag cardboard.  For some reason, these little notebooks were much handier and always had a space in my pocket or purse, at the ready to take down an odd phone number, a task that had to take place, or an appointment to be transferred onto the "big calendar."  No notepad or spiral bound booklet did the trick: it had to be one of my favorite Moleskine booklets.

They don't need a cover though, but it is really nice looking and can be refilled endlessly with this style/size of moleskine cahier.  My dad keeps a journal with him all the time and this is his favorite size as it fits easily in his pocket.  He has used these for years and they survive well over time.

3784	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This credit-card-sized motivational bottle opener is great for on the go situations.  Personally I do not put it in my wallet, as it is a little on the heavy side and I like to keep my wallet minimalist.  But it is a perfect fit for my zippered pouch in my purse.  The fum graphics remind me not to forget about working out (rarely do I need to be reminded to sleep and eat).

832	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Each Beatles record was an advance and a revelation of some sort.  Each album introduced something creative and new. Sgt. Pepper, however, rose above the rest.  It represented a quantum leap beyond what had gone before, beginning with the cover.  It was an explosion of imagery and artistry and innovation from beginning to end.  (That might not be apparent now, over 40 years later, as the innovative techniques which the Beatles inspired and pioneered have become commonplace.)  The lyrics, the tunes, the voices, the harmonies, the instruments, the orchestrations and the technical wizardry of George Martin all conspired to reflect the spirit of the time.  This might be best embodied in the aural perfection of the closing "A Day in the Life."  The album continues to amaze me.  When you buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, as you should, turn down the lights, turn up the sound, and just listen.  It's a trip!

9424	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Just what I needed. I'm happy with the purchase and the color too.
I have the version with the singular green button on the top left [see photos]. Other product photos may show otherwise. The buttons are laid out in a tall rounded rectangular shape, with color-coded buttons grouped in an intuitive way. The singular green button gives it a spark of personality, and the curves all around it feels very nice to hold in your hand. Included is a white plastic double-sided shortcut sheet on how to use all the functions.
4167	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Bought this for our 5 & 6 year old. Use the blue tack to stick to the walls however the roll in it makes it difficult to keep flat on the wall. Does what it is intended to do. Made from fairly durable materials and should hold up for years to come.

You won't go wrong with this notebook.
It has different sections, and some I like and some I don't.  I'd like to have some ruled pages, for example.  The alphabetical index tabs are set up like an address book.  Every letter has the same amount of space.  I can overcome that, though.  In my address book, the "W" section always overflowed; I just put in "see 'L'" for more of that letter.  There are some stickers tucked in the back you can use if you want.  The most useful are for labeling tabs to personalize the functionality of the journal.  The outside cover is pretty decent, and the 3 ribbons are handy for flipping back and forth - you'll get what I mean when you buy yours.  Too big for a pocket, but still a handy size.
  50-50 on ordering again
For the pages that aren't printed with yearly, monthly and weekly calendar, pp3-16, on how to use the AD system to plan, a PDF file provided with purchase would save paper and make the planners slimmer. I will be removing those pages.  I also find the address pages useless, I store contacts and addresses in my phone.
As for using cartridges from clone manufacturers, my experience has been that they often require far more "priming" than the original manufacturer's product.  As a result, you're wasting ink and saving less money than you may have thought.
5240	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I love the size of these notebooks, and I love the grid paper...my only complaint is that the pages are thin...I use these as junk journals, regular daily journals too, and I find I have to glue two or three pages together so my ink doesn't bleed. But they're still amazing!
6811	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I had a pen like this years ago. This one is very similar, but cannot remember if the end had a black tip or not. When you have a nice pen like this, it is not good to say yes if someone asks you for one on the street. A guy once dropped the old one, plus some people may try to keep it. May be a little safer with a relative or friend. I decided I needed my own, because even when I am over mother's place, she has some, but can never find a good one.  I decided I needed one to keep in my pocket. When I go past a church while taking my hourly walk, I like to write down the scriptures they have outside on the sign. Before, I had to just memorize them. Cross is one of the best permanent pens you can buy, so I recommend this one.

5026	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The perfect size notebook to take on a trip to enter trip diary notes in. The quadrille "lines"  will allow sketches as well as text. I like to draw little cartoons of things I see. The  pocket inside the back cover will hold the paper ephemera that one picks up on travels. Paper seems thick enough to handle writing on both sides of a page without bleeding through. Cover is a nice warm grey color, and the whole notebook is flexible, yet firm enough to write in without support underneath.

6567	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Poorly designed and all togeather impractical, basically a waste of $20. The days of the week are so narrow that you can't even write a single word. It has the days plotted out by hour, which is impractical when you need to jot down a list of things that need to be accomplished. As a student Saturday and sunday are extreamly usefull days of the week, but the planner just gives them tiny sections. I threw mine away after I bought a $5 one from my college bookstore, hopefully it can be recycled and provide some use as paper towels.
5380	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Still the best you can buy!
I was happy to see this new "dishwasher-friendly"alternative in black handles, a larger "man-size" peeler and good ratings. I bought this set for a gift for a recently married son who does most of the cooking in his household. He loves it and says the peeler feels good in his hand, the paring knife is sharp and we are sure these will last him for many years to come. I expect he will be buying other pieces as well. Highly recommended
4541	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Just tried this to organize my folders, and it works great.  It's sturdy,
9691	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Yah.  Same part number, but cheapened out like crazy.  I was a huge fan of the original (like others), but this one is a couple inches shorter in length, about 60% in height, and narrower as well.  The foam is not nearly as soft.  As I type in the "home row" position, my wrists are mostly on the edge and not on the flat part.  Totally different product and not comfortable.  I can't understand why manufacturers can't figure out how to make a decent wrist rest.  They seem to only care about cost and making a cheap product.

8230	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have a card software package and make a lot of greeting cards.  They come out really nice on this card stock and I've had a lot of compliments on my cards.

2881	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Good strong sturdy  materials. I even like the slightly sassy sayings on the folder. I'd give them 3.5 stars if possible.
I have also tried the dotted -Field Notes- which I liked for their light weight BUT prefer the hard cover of MS as it provides a firm support for writing on uneven surfaces like my lap or holding it in my hand. I also like this paper better than FN as it gets my hand less tired. Its slight yellow tone makes the dots contrast less, compared to a white sheet (as in the FN). I consider this a good thing.

Seriously.
3812	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	good quality.
The paper is a nice cream color. which is really easy on the eyes. Depending on your pen/marker, of course, it doesn't seem to bleed through the other side of the paper, which is a D-R-E-A-M! I wrote August in with a prismacolor marker and THAT bleed through, but those are really art markers that require thicker paper, so there's that. I posted photos of the backsides of some pages to show you :) The second to last is that back of 005 prismacolor art pens, muji pens, and pilot 05 pen :)
2584	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Not what I thought it would be. Put it down. Finally picked it back up and I am into this book. It was a better day. Open heart, open mind, open ideas.

4712	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love using these notebooks for school.  Also, read carefully as this is a three pack.  I ended up with 9 notebooks.  Be warned only a few pages in the back are detachable.
3589	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	bought 3 of these, works great
4964	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I love the quality feel of the notebook itself, but the paper seems to be very thin to me. I think it would be 5 starts definitely if the paper was just a little bit thicker. With the current thinness, it feel like I would be better off using a pencil which I really do not want to use. However, I bought this to take notes and write down ideas at work, and it is serving me very well.

If you have an induction range, (e.g., I have the Viking Induction) note that the skillet does not contain much inductive material, and it heats considerably slower than carbon steel or cast iron. On the other hand, that is convenient because you do not want to accidentally ruin a nonstick finish by overheating the pan.

107	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	So glad I ordered this!  It carries everything I need, bible, notebook, reading glasses, pens! : )  I can even slide my phone in the front pocket! : )
The package included three new batteries which would have cost me a couple of bucks apiece locally.
5.  Organizer starts in JULY which wasn't a problem for me, but most folk probably don't think about organizers until December...
3. The squared grid is dotted instead of solid lines.

5192	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It has a satisfying weight and pleasant texture on the cover and paper but the cover gouges and scratches very easily. It's nice if you're trying to go for that heavily-used look but it would be nice to have a little more durability. The paper is a bit smooth to the touch which makes it a little harder to write on with lower quality ballpoints which is what gives this a four star.

All in all, it IS a great notebook, and despite the few shortcomings, I highly recommend it.
3168	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	All of my boarders fit with the length. I can't close it because I overstuffed it. I do like it better them the long cardboard box I had for years.
Thank you, little moleskine notebook, for all the memories. Note taking will never be the same without you.
I do however love the note pages in the back of the planner. So another useful alternative would be to take those 18 useless printed pages and make them blank or grid.
5686	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm a notebook and journal fiend. I have more than I need and I keep buying more. Moleskine however are the best and highest quality notebooks in the industry. This one pairs great with Evernote, another favorite product of mine. If you love organization and want to combine electronic with written this is well worth the price.
I rate the TI-83 Plus 5 out of 5 stars.
4365	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	As expected.
9384	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Liked this product a lot, and it does great things to ease the challenges of carpal tunnel syndrome. The mouse operating area is plenty big for a normal mouse. The only reason I knocked off a star is that the gel pad is just a little higher than should be. Makes things a little awkward, but very do-able
Please note that I did receive these Thank You cards at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Honestly, I couldn't be happier, they are a quality card and I would absolutely recommend them. Excellent product!
5453	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This notebook is a great way to carry your notes around. The cover is made of a hard plastic, so the book won't get crushed in a bag or pocket like the smaller Moleskines covered in brown paper. The pages are large enough so that your writing doesn't feel cramped, and you can draw things out big enough to easily share with with others (example: I diagrammed a football play for someone sitting across a small table, and they were able to follow without holding the notebook up to their face).
- Unobtrusive.  Simple, ignorable black cover.

3501	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have tried a million stools for my day to day work at my office. I have tried stools in all price ranges (up to $700) and they all break or have major flaws. This one though, is just great. Not a whole lot of padding, but I have never been uncomfortable on it. And best of all its durable! I have had it for a couple years now with no problems at all. I love it. I'm ordering 4 more for my office mates.
6609	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This planner is out of this world awesome! So awesome I am going to do a vlog on it!
8545	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The calculator is perfect for 7th graders and up. My daughter always uses it for chemistry and algebra. At first I didn't like the calculator because I thought that it didn't have all of the keys needed for algebra, since I didn't go to school in America I didn't know what kind of calculators were needed for school.
One thing that's different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes. Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs, and this envelope size isn't always easy to find. The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface isn't glossy.
6603	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Pretty sure title should say it all! I absolutely love this planner. I'm glad I purchased it when I did because I have quickly realized that few years into college, and harder classes + job shadowing + 3 job juggling + making time for fun all are important!
61	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love this blue bilbe cover and it goes along with his bible so nicely.  Love the idea of the pockets and the carry handle my son carried it to church for a while it even had room for his kindle fire to go in it.
This baby (TI-89) is FAST!, I can say its way faster than my old HP, specially when dealing with a big matrix or table.
3454	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	They have a plastic feel or coating so they would be more durable than the cheaper paper type. I've put one on my girls cell phone and it's still sticking. It seems that I could unpeel and use again. So overall, a good sticker for those that like or love strange looking owls.

Definitely worth the price~~~
2- I have had it in my office for months now and the color is as vibrant as when I put it up
8978	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I had an old one just like this one and didn't realize how dirty it had gotten until I spilled water on it.  Out it went and I replaced it with a new one.  If you haven't changed yours in a while...it's probably time.  Great price.  Great product.  Great support...soft yet firm and forms to your use.  Highly recommend.
333	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Pretty great quality
4278	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a beautiful book. I like that it has the gold edging on each page, with a Bible verse at the bottom of each page.  The red ribbon bookmark is a nice touch.
8553	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very inexpensive and solar-powered.  At under $13, you cannot beat the price.  If your needs are modest, this may be an excellent choice for you.
2333	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nice little book. Stores a lot of info.
1115	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	these are great tabs.  they are much more sturdy than the other bible tabs available.  can you guys make some tabs for our bible study?
The notebook itself is extremely well made.  All the details, from the little pocket in the back, to the detachable pages and the elastic bookmark were well designed and implemented.  And the cover feels nice and is really tough.  As a contractor, stuff I used every day needs to take a beating, and this little notebook does just that.  The paper is nice too, perfect for pencil, and pen, but a sharpie will bleed through.  Though, for it's size, a sharpie is too big anyway.  The reporter style is perfect for my needs because most of what I use it for is lists.  Writing the quantity of an item in the spine of a regular notebook is frustrating.  You have to crack it open to really use the full sheet.  Oh, and no spiral binding makes this truly comfortable in my pocket.
1377	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	You get a large variety of colors and smells. The pens write smooth without skipping. The smell lasts on the paper. I have ordered these pens three times now and always satisfied.

I use a trackball mouse so those of you with regular mice might have more movement issues with smudging ink or the like.

2964	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are exactly as described.  I am glad the dimensions were included.  It is easy to read and a great deal of fun to hand out.  I have ordered more because I am going through them so quickly! As fun to give as they are to receive, I have yet to encounter a recipient who wasn't thrilled to get one.  Everyone could use some encouragement on any given day.  This product helps me quickly provide encouragement and amusement to others.
7911	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This printer family is wonderful if you do a lot of printing. The printers are pretty costly, but because you can replace each color of ink separately, and replace the printing jet heads for each color separately also, you can save a lot on replacement supplies. These ink cartridges hold a *lot* of ink.
239	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It serves it's purpose.  It's a little flimsy, but to homeschool my pre-kindergartener it's fine I suppose.

345	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a great tool for my classroom.  Got it laminated so it will last for years to come.  I only wish it came laminated.
It was easy to use, my son helped me make mash potatoes and he was able to use it just fine. It is made out of stainless steel which is another feature that I liked about it, but it isn't the strongest stainless steel. It doesn't seem heavy duty as it is advertised to be.
1759	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Goldistock National Parks calendar pages seem thick and may not curl as advertised.  I'll see at the end of 2018.  The pages of the Sierra Club 2017 calendar we had curled badly. The spaces to write notes in this Goldistock calendar are large and not cluttered with large messages like some other calendars.  I can't figure out why some other calendars clutter their days with large messages since the whole purpose of buying calendars like this is to write notes for the days.  I wish this calendar was spiral bound but we'll see how it works as is.  So far 5 stars.
Still love it!  I makes perfect beans, perfect soups, high quality, cleans really well.  So worth the price.  It is the "Cadillac" of pressure cookers!  I really enjoy it.
5795	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a first rate product; very high quality and a pleasure to pull out and use.

8747	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works great
5086	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	The paper is fairly thin, and the ribbon place mark is rather flimsy. If this were made with slightly better materials it would be an out of the park product, but for me as is it's only a 4 stars.
* Quality of paper is OK, I would liked to see a bit thicker paper. This is the one thing I did not like.
9715	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	perfect

7817	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My son must eat calculators because I seem to be buying them constantly. You can never go wrong with Texas Instruments. This had all the little doodad math buttons his class required. I have heard no complaints. He says it is working well for his class.

The issue for me was hard cover or soft cover?
 I am a pen person, never written a review before but felt this was too bad to be true.  The very best refill i've found and been using for years is the Schmidt...the make refill for every pen from not expensive to top of the line pens...they write like a dream and last for a long time.  I highly recommend the Schmidt for any pen you are thinking of buying.  After all it's the ink that matters.  The pen is just the container.
3540	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are really great knives. They came razor sharp out of the box, are well balanced, and super light. It is worth mentioning that the light weight of these knives, and the lack of a guard on at the beginning of the blade can also be a downside to some, as it is likely a lot easier to accidentally cut oneself with these knives than your average knife.
3.  I found it easy to use and I liked the layout:

4662	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Despite my love of computers and digital devices, I still think there's something special about a good notebook.  For years I tracked daily accomplishments and goals in date books, until I switched to a PDA.  Something was missing, though.  It's fine for appointments and tasks -- after all, a notebook won't beep at you -- but the things that were really useful to me: recording data, events, and work done... that just didn't fit well in a digital setting.
Otherwise, I'm still very satisfied with them!
The back has extra note pages. You can also download templates from moleskine.
Now that I'm in graduate school, I ran out of all of notebook space I've used throughout high school and undergrad, so, being spoiled by Moleskine, I thought about getting these folio versions.  Why didn't I get them sooner?!

Cons:

 Very Soft and Beautiful Cover.

3351	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this book for my 6 year old daughter who is in the first grade. She is having so much fun with this book and learning at the same time. The instructions in the book are easy  to follow for parent and child. She is learning map skills, landforms and bodies of water, continents and oceans and about animals that lives on the different continents. There's  a map of the United states of America showing all 50 states with their names. To the back of the book there are two posters that you can tear out from the book and stick on your wall. The two posters consists of continents and oceans, and lands forms of body of water. Overall this is a great book and my child is learning so much. The only thing I don't like about this book is that some of the exercises are cut and paste and pages have writing on both sides. So you can't cut the words out and paste it because there are writing on the other side of the paper, so you would have to photo copy it, draw it or write it on a piece of paper and then paste it in the book.
There is a pocket inside the back cover that doesn't quite along with the back cover, so the glue eventually fails and it just flops about, but it doesn't bother me enough to fix it yet with tape or glue.
This will come in handy on our fishing trips and in my home tool kit.
1. The cover is beautifully embossed with the Evernote logo and icons from the splash screen.
5799	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nothing fills my heart with quite the same joy as an empty kraft-covered moleskine notebook. I love the brown covers especially (because I like drawing on them) and love the paper and love this size book particularly.
Before this journal, I'd track things, but forget to collect various details. As a result when I'd go back to review I'd be wondering what I meant about some of the stuff I'd written.

8061	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this calculator after having used a TI-83+ for a few years. The power in this little machine is incredible (and in fact uses the same processor as the Macintosh Classic computer from 1991) and the display resolution is fabulous, especially compared to the older calculators. While I have yet to use some of its more advanced functions, the ones I've used have been great. Some of the functions from the TI-83 are moved and take a bit of adapting, but after a few weeks you'll love the menus so much you'll never want to use a TI-83 (or a regular scientific calculator) again.
4781	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	The A4 style should cover the bases for all kinds of writers and artists. Its a great take-a-long work book, or permanent repository. I just wish it (and this is true of the entire Moleskin line) were not so expensive.

Rhodia paper is some of the best in the world (they're owned by Clairefontaine, whose paper is to die for). With the Rhodia paper you will not experience bleed through. You will not experience show through. You will be able to see the inks' shading characteristics. And even the wettest blob of an inky line you can lay down will not feather. Yes, the Webnotebooks are twice the price, but they are one hundred percent absolutely worth it if what you're after is actual quality, not a fad.

Prior to using this spray, I feared that it would have a chemical or overly harsh scent.

I would recommend this spray to anyone but particularly to those engaged in any type of exercise or sports activities.

8322	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I am and education major and I bought this at the advice of my professor (I am a Math Education major) because she showed how you can use a simple key on it to perform permutation and combination evaluations.

7346	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I bought it for  a project. However it was a great reminder that so much of what we see on tv lacks context with the rest of the world.  In todays world trouble spots are spread across a number of continents.
4654	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Useful for just about anything you want to keep track of, remember, draw, etc., especially when you're out and about.  Small, thin, flexible, lightweight, fits into a pocket or purse,--and did I say totally cool too?  To-do lists, shopping lists, absolutely indispensible to me!  I buy these in all colors, and use them at home too.  I label the covers for reference, for instance: Guests/menus (so I don't forget and serve the same dishes to the same people!), Computer (tips, things I want to ask about), Garden (what and when I planted or harvested with notes), Auto (repairs, oil changes)--you get the idea.  One is labeled for each of my kids (notes of what they'd like or what gifts I gave them, etc. etc. etc.).  I like this better than computerized lists; these are just more available, always, a forever reference!  A great and thoughtful gift, people love them.
I am not letting the app color my review of the remote. The remote itself works great. It's just the price of the clicker that seems outlandish to me, but at least it has a fairly decent resale value, and to their credit, i>clicker makes that process very easy.

8062	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Perhaps the ultimate compliment is that after agonizing over which one of these super handhelds to buy I was pleased to discover that with the TI-89 I made a very good choice.  I have already become fairly proficient with it and I'm a non-mathematical person.  The supplied manual walks you through each environment with examples that orient you quickly.  I was able to use it for what I wanted it for suprisingly quickly.  Before long you begin setting it up and using it with little if any reference to the help.
2600	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love how I can adjust the height of the bars for my charts. The shelf at the bottom is perfect for holding materials I need for Circle Time.

306	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is the perfect little notebook to keep in your purse - I often find myself searching for a piece of scrap paper when I need to jot down an address or phone number (as my memory is awful!) so i I usually have to make do with the back of a recipt. Clearly, having an actual notebook is far preferred!
Ok, that was a little rant, sorry.  But this book is just lovely.  I took some images to give you an idea of what you're in for. But there are 128 nice thick pages for you to read or skim to your hearts desire which is nice for an art book with techniques.  And there are loads and loads of images to help you get from one stage to another.  In one technique where she paints some lovely little birds she has 6 pages and there are 20 images.  Other techniques might be a page or 2.  But they are all inspirational and with so many new items being released every time I turn around it is fun to find new ways to use things.  You don't have to be rich to art journal. Dina even shows you how to use butcher paper in your journal.  She also uses a sewing machine in a couple techniques.  You can't go wrong with this book, even if her style isn't your style.

3. The Font - The old Dilbert calendars had an easy to read font for the date and day of the week. They used a bold black font on a white background, something that everyone is accustomed to and can read easily. Now they have a thinner black font with a white highlight on a lime green background. It actually is harder to read, especially when you wake up in the morning. The obnoxious orange seal on the bottom right of every page with Scott Adams name only adds to the visual aggravation.

Overall, the Pantone GP1401 Formula Guide is a very expensive purchase, but does a necessary job.  It is common to have a color on your computer screen look completely different than the final printed product, and this type of color guide is absolutely critical to have in that situation.  Even though this set is a little delicate because of the thin paper, it is really due to the huge number of colors that would become much less portable with heavier paper stock.  If you are looking for a good set of Pantone color swatches, this one is worth consideration.

Baked some chicken with the skin on and the grease made it easy to just peel the tape off. No,we didn't eat any tape. Just baking the chicken made the tape loosen.

I feel like it would be more handy for it to open from the bottom up??  I really don't understand why anyone would want it to open the way it does.  But I make it work.  It's very sturdy.  I also don't like how slick it is because it falls off my seat.  Perhaps rubber bottom in the future so it sticks to a surface?

452	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I don't know why Amazon can't put the actual and true size of this map on the site. Is it really THAT HARD? I couldn't figure out what the size of this thing was and the 31.5" size indication with other ridiculous numbers is the height - so beware this thing is BIG. approx. 60" wide and 32" tall. Besides the size problem the map looks faintly printed and feels really cheap in general. It's not what I would call "laminated" more like "coated with a nano layer of plastic". Also, the slightest accidental bending while handling this huge map will likely leave a permanent crease or wrinkle in the map. Returned!

855	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a recording packed with loads of good old fashioned Beatle lore.  Paul-is-dead-lore, The Beatles are the next Mozarts lore, The Beach Boys scared the Beatles back into the studios lore (this is true...just ask Sir Paul McCartney, who is of course alive and well, thank you very much, and on his gazillionteenth tour with Lady Heather and baby Bea in tow)...and in the Days of Vinyl it took turns being called "the greatest" along with "Abbey Road".  Being knee-high to a cicadid when the Beatles were at their height, but nonetheless a huge fan, I knew them from AM radio, not albums.  So I never knew which songs were on which lps until high school, when our team-tought humanities instructors (see my "So You'd Like to be a Pseudo-Expert in Western Culture" list) gave their infamous "Sgt.

Without wanting to guild the lily by buying a huge curriculum given our concentration on reading and math in Kindergarten, I did need a little bit of a framework to use as a jumping off point for our geography studies next year. This book will do just that. It is laid out in a systematic manner with lots of activities and ideas, but will also let the user add and expand upon the ideas without interfering to much. Very pleased.

I chose this red one for Scripture studies, and it's no different than the standard, black stiff-covered Moleskine.  Good, portable size despite it being the large version, and the rich, poppy-red hue gives the owner the sense that there's just no way to lose it.

Not only is this good price-wise, but it's durable, comfortable, user-friendly and transportable. I take a pad with me everywhere (bought 3) to ease up the strain of my wrist's carpel tunnel syndrome. Bought some more pads as gifts during this Black Friday shopping time.
5246	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have been using these notebooks since early 2007. They are an integral part of my to-do list system, which I describe in more detail here:[...]
1485	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It's hard to tell from the pic but this is not 3 dimensional as it looks. Flat book.  It is nice with all the little extras but if you need just a plain day planner you can do better on the price. I wanted something a little nicer looking and this is definitely cute but there is no wow factor.
If you're looking for a step up in quality without a hike in price, definitely buy these. Buy more than you need as well, because they're not often in stock with Amazon.

9783	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm kind of surprised to see so many negative reviews or this stapler. I bought one (locally) and have had it for two years now and use it very often and it's very rugged and reliable. Yes, it is heavy, but that heft helps make it stronger, I believe. Also, yes, it takes some force to drive a staple, but it's not something a child or the average grandmother should be using--their are lighter-duty staplers for people that don't want a heavy-duty stapler (Arrow actually makes a nice lightweight version).
6418	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	They're too light to be used for highlighting.  Don't buy them, you'll be unhappy. I acn't imagine why I have to write six more words.  I hope this is enough

I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register).  No drops, no abuse.  The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic.  The keys feel hollow and light.  The available functions are great.  This is a classic calculator.  But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...

Miscellaneous
After being so disappointed in this stapler, I did further research and discovered a much better option built by Tacwise: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091CECNE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0091CECNE&linkCode=as2&tag=todmedblo-20&linkId=GSK2JZM2LMJEI2U4

I throw it in my purse (a large one, of course) and it goes everywhere with me.  I use this everyday, multiple times a day and it takes a beating.  Mine is well worn but there is still an element of class when you pull out the black, leather-looking notebook.  It always looks professional even when some of the stuff inside isn't.  ;)
996	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I really like this world map that we ordered from Amazon.  I ordered it so that my son could put stickers on it for science.  It came packaged in thick plastic, a cardboard tube, and a rectangular box, so it was very well packaged.  There were no scratches, folds, or other imperfections at all.  The map is very large, which is exactly what I was looking for.  It is well labeled, also.  Another thing I like about this map is it's neutral colors.  No hot pink countries here.  It is nicely laminated, so I am hoping eventually when we are done with the science stickers, they will come off.  If not, it wasn't very expensive, so I'd order another one.

7287	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's hard to find an acceptable printer paper for an HP1022 Laserjet because most papers I have tried have a problem with heat curling when printing large documents. The heat curl sometimes destroys the printer's ability to print the 2nd side of a 2 sided document if quite a few pages are being printed. Received this paper today and immediately put it into my printer and tested it and it passed with flying colors. A big plus is that not only was the cost of the paper extremely affordable but it came in just a couple of days with prepaid shipping.
8658	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Really great.  Excellent support for your wrist.

1180	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are simple yet elegant Thank You Cards. I am always writing thank you notes for friends, family and business associates. When I was offered these simple thank you cards at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review, I was happy to do just that. These cards arrived on time and in a nice clear, solid package. There were 12 Thank You cards, blank inside, made out of a premium grade linen cardstock. These are definitely not your average Thank You cards. I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. A quality I always look for when buying cards, it seems so old-fashioned, not to mention unsanitary to lick an envelope shut! I am very please with the quality of these cards and will definitely put them to good use. Never underestimate the power of a thoughtful, well written & hand written Thank You note. It's an extra added touch that shows you took the time out to write the card, therefore, you really care. I would definitely buy these again. In fact, there was a Thank You note included with these cards thanking me for my purchase and a coupon code to use at the website for an 18% discount and free shipping on my future purchase. Now that is something I can appreciate. A very thoughtful gesture.

Never in my life as a student or engineer have I had a defective calculator that did not calculate correctly.  Well, there is a first time for everything.  My college student daughter kept getting the wrong results when using this calculator.  Her classmate tells her that the model of her TI calculator has been known to have defects.  She looks it up on Google and finds other bad reviews.  So although I never had issues with my own TI calculator which I've had since high school (35 years ago) and still works perfectly, I DO have issues with this model which may be unreliable.  My daughter has since dropped out of engineering and I hope it's not because she was doing so poorly in Calculus with her defective calculator.  Ugh. I got her a new Casio scientific calculator and so far so good.  Crossing my fingers...
1503	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great product, I have several of them. The meter helps me determine when some of my plants really need water (other than watching them wilt in place).

5547	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	As the treasurer for a small community organisation, I needed a Moleskine with a bit more space, and a page with a bit more structure. The Extra Large Dotted page fit the bill perfectly.
664	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Smaller than expected but great for a cozy kitchen. The design is even cuter in person and the cards are lovely.
Overall, I can't recommend these things enough. They are by far the highest-quality notebook (pocket or otherwise) that I've ever used. You can rest assured that Moleskin will be my notebook brand of choice from this point forward. The top-notch design combined with the superior quality of construction creates a harmonious symphony of a premier product and customer satisfaction that mirrors Moleskin's dedication to their customers and to their craft. Plus, at $6 for two notebooks, you can rest assured that you're not paying through the roof for your notebook!

4097	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My absolute favorite knife (Wusthof) that I had for years went missing. I was happy when I found what I thought an exact replacement and I did. These knives are sharp, light and the best I've ever had. It's easy to use and not at all bulky, something I grew to value when my original went missing. I use this knife for everything from tomatoes to meats and all in between. It makes kitchen cutting chores a breeze. This is the knife to have.
So far, I haven't noticed any issues with this difference, but as I use them more, I have a feeling the folded areas will start to peel. (The other kinds rip at the folds after many uses as well, so I'm not sure the quality is going to be affected.)
5458	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my work bullet journaling. Compliments my personal 12M agenda perfectly.
3276	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This was a bit wrinkled and folded during shipment (I was surprised no protective cover was put on it), but we had planned on cutting it into smaller flashcards anyway, so it really wasn't too big of a deal for us.  If you're intending on using it on a wall, you might reconsider having it shipped, but then again, maybe our experience was unique.  Either way, it's a great little chart for my 7- and 8-year-old daughters to start familiarizing themselves with their basic multiplication facts.  We cut ours out and put it on a ring, so they flip through the cards and quiz each other.  It's a great car activity or activity in the grocery store... keeps them busy, learning, and having fun!
For our first project, we built sentences. It soon led to the kids creating a whole bunch of their own cards (using index cards, cut in 1/2). The creativity that this tool inspired, made it well-worth the (very reasonable) cost.
2087	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very nice bookmark, love the beaded tassel.
I really am so pleased with the Calphalon pots that I don't think I'll ever have to buy pots and pans again!  I have enough for my cooking needs and honestly expect them to last at least another 30 years!
8136	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought these to print Christmas cards, and they did not disappoint! The cards were easy to print on, and the photos I used came out beautifully. I might even consider using them for my professional photography. :-) A good buy!
450	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very nice map. I put it in my office and it really enhances the appearance of that particular wall. I have just obtained some map pins to identify places I've been and it should be a good addition.


886	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nice map but check the measurements - it's HUGE.  I had trouble finding a space and if I had looked more closely, I would have purchased a smaller one!
4296	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I got one for me and gave several as gifts. It's very good quality. I got a good pen to go with it.  I think everyone should journal because it leaves something behind for your kids, or family or whoever reads it.  Plus you yourself can look back and reflect on what you were thinking, how you've grown or need to grow, etc...

8739	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A good buy
3798	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These came packaged in a nice box.  They are really cute and made a great Christmas gift.

BANG.  IT BREAKS.  THE SCREEN SHOWS ZERO INSTEAD OF -512 AND YOU CANNOT ADD ANY NUMBER TO -512
6939	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Full disclosure, I haven't bought this pen yet from Amazon. Mine was a gift and is still going strong, but I love it so much I tracked it down to write a review for other pen connoisseurs. I will buy another when mine wears out. It survived a deployment to Afghanistan as one of my two daily use pens, and has continued strong for the five years I've used it since.
I would tend to buy this as a small gift item. For something like that, this is definitely recommended.
4646	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Easy to install - be careful to remove all tape covering the contacts - the printer recognizes the new cartridges and the color is fine! All is well!
3619	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	All these reviews are correct. They are in fact adorable. I must've been the only customer that received a pepper & pepper shaker (they both have the brown around the eyes). I don't eat salt/pepper much, but.....it's always a 50/50 chance I'll get it right.
9494	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great for school. An essential calculator for any Actuarial Science major.

I would also point out that the spaces are VERY small and limited; so if you take anything like dietary supplements or want to keep a more detailed account of what you're eating, this simply isn't going to cut it unless you have tiny, diminutive hand-writing, this is just useless unless all you're writing is single words in each space. Not one of Knock Knock's best.
1388	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Picked this out for my daughter.  She absolutely loves the colorful pictures and will probably keep the calendar even when it's expired.
Nice soft moleskin covering.  Good price.
7361	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this calculator
  I prefer the reporter style with the flip top for my TO DO list that accompanies my daily planner.  If something does not make it into this TO DO list ... well, it just does not get done.  I have tried numerous other "TO DO" items from ring binders to high-tech handhelds ... NONE have worked as well as plain old paper and pen.
9791	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I'm not really sure there's a definition of "heavy duty" for me to compare this thing to. But it seems well made. I stapled the bejesus out of some pine bed slats during which which it performed admirably. I never had any jams and the staples penetrated the wood completely, but others have complained. The loading mechanism is weird and is an excellent opportunity to pinch your finger, but overall it seemed to be a fine staple gun to me.
1475	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Fun color.  Good for easy hanging and for clothes that have hanging "issues".
3682	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love the way my hair feels and smells. Adds body. Have used for years.
7471	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love this calculator. I have bought the same model multiple times since I was in junior high. My son is now in jr high so it was a no brainer when he needed one.

The binding is nice, the paper quality is fantastic (both lined and blank). I was very surprised at how great the paper was with graphite, charcoal, and ink given the price. This is definitely a great value for students and art enthusiasts on a budget. The size varieties are nice, ranging from pocket size to full notebook.
You know you want this.  Get the Dymo LabelWriter and order these clear labels!  Also, I recommend the extra large shipping labels to label cartons, packages, folders and CD holders/sleeves.

116	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Met my expectations.  The only thing I would like better is an outside pocket for quick access to notes.
The handle does need considerable pressure to release a staple, so for those who have difficulty griping items tightly this tool could be problematic, but for me it performed quite well.
Just a caveat about the lids- the glass lid for this 2.5 quart shallow saucepan is slightly greater than 8", so it will not fit the omelette/fry pan, which is annoying.  However, I checked at a brick and mortar store, and the 8-quart stockpot lid is interchangeable with the 10" omelette/fry pan, and 3 quart sautepan.  But, it does NOT fit the 10" stir fry pan, arrgh!  Unfortunately, they do not carry the 3.5 quart saucepan (this item that I am reviewing) in-store so I could not compare lid sizes.  In fact, when I received this item from Amazon, it came in a box marked as something like 'special add-on gift for you', which suggests to me that perhaps this isn't a regularly sold item at your local store.
7891	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Came packaged as promised however have not used it yet but assume it will work as promised as well.  Too soon to know for sure if will perform as expected, however have no reason to believe it won't.
5793	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	These little journals are a perfect size for your pocket at work. I wish I read that they don't have lines, but oh well. I also use one to jot down recipes.
6479	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I searched all over for a planner that works like I think.  This is it for me, and so I bought the for the second year (2017).  I find the introduction to calendaring at the beginning inspiring and helpful to getting the most out of the planner as possible.
Best of all, these come packed just as well as the KEF speakers. The box has foam cutouts that fit all the pieces, and the bases come wrapped in cloth just like the speakers.  Assembly is a snap (2 screws, and they include the Allen wrench you need). The speakers attach very easily as well -- just remove the base (1 screw) and mount it on the stand.
When it arrived, I first noticed how heavy it was for its size . . . .a sign of being well made I hope!.
I plan to keep it in the car when not camping so I can have the glass break tool handy.
870	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We've owned and used many wall maps over the years as students, military officers and business professionals.  This is a big, beautiful and well detailed map that was a fantastic purchase at $6.95 PRIME. It arrived in great condition and went on the wall with only surprisingly minimal curling issues to deal with.  After rolling it in the reverse direction that it was shipped, it laid nice and flat against the wall.  The colors and details are great and the map is functioning as an attractive and useful aid as we learn about the world in which we live and track the news of the day. FYI, the finish is flat, not glossy,  It takes pencil marks well and erases with minimal damage.
Nice things
2366	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Exactly what I needed for my nice pen
The binder and the section dividers which have pockets are very attractive.  I do wish the dividers were not pre-printers with section titles.  Their choice of titles is all wrong for me and I wish they were blank.
2239	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Exactly as pictured.

7563	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Its an older style calculator that I purchased to replace one just like it from a very long time ago.  Works for what we need it for.
1324	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I bought these at a book store and they were recommended by the sales person. I really enjoy these gel pens but wish the scent was stronger. I have a hard time picking it up but I like the way the gel pens write and color. I could have just gotten a bad box or maybe they were sitting on the shelf too long. The one that really stands out is the watermelon one and it smells great!

The to-do, delegated tasks, and projects lists are pretty useful; however, I end up using delegated for notes more often than not. So, not perfect... but, a good substitute for those looking for ways of keeping track of their to-do list in an organized fashion.

6317	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased the  smaller form of this book and the large size is just as nice, and works when you need more space per page to record your notes. Good price for the great quality of this product.

3152	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This numbers chart is inexpensive and a great value for what you pay.  My daughter loves it.  I recommend getting your child a pointer when using it.  It makes them get more involved and excited about learning their numbers.  This chart does come rolled up, however, if you unroll it and put something on it for a day it quickly goes flat.  Worth it!
It will take fountain pen ink, but not very well. Water based inks from fountain pens tends to bead up slightly due to the almost waxy finish. Graphite or sharp charcoal pencils will also work although the smoothness of the paper will tend to smudge easier.

4611	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great stencils but you really need to use a fine point pen or market to get into all the corners and get it to look like the shape. Luckily I bought a case of fine point washable markers so we draw on our dinning table that handles washable markers beautifully. There are so many stencils. I've only used a few so far. Love that it comes with a case to hold all of them.

4953	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I've always heard about Moleskine notebooks, and this is the first one that I've ever had. I really like this, and now I'm always going to use nice notebooks, instead of the budget notebooks that I have been using. This is extremely high quality. I carry it around everywhere and I use it a lot. It's extremely comfortable to write on, and the spine holds up no matter how much bending or pressure that I put on it.
Also, one of my Bibles has veeeeery thin pages and it still works great. I love those tabs and totally recommend them. :-)
A colleague has a similar mouse pad in gray/blue and it shows so much grime from use.  This black one does not- so that was a major plus!  What else can I say about a mouse pad..... it got the job done.

They are good... very good
5593	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I don't understand why the Moleskine pocket planners are so bad for most fountain pen inks, when this little jewel works perfectly for most of my fountain pens I have, including one with Bay State Blue, the worst bleeder of my current inks!!  I was not expecting much because of bad experience with the mini planners, but this is a keeper for my fountain pens!

7065	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a genuine HP printer cartridge at a terrific price - less than half of what I could find it for at other places.  I put it in my trusty old HP4 and it's printing like a dream again!  Would buy again - grat price.

Back at home, I emptied, rinsed, and sat down to look it over closer. Really nice little bottle. When it arrives it is rolled up and secured with an elastic band. I expect the band to eventually fail like most do, but it won't really matter because a new rubber band can be easily placed if you want to roll it back up. Taking time to examine it, I wondered how strong it was because it seemed pretty thin and flexible. So I filled it up and started tossing it around on the furniture and gently to the floor.... no damage of course. So, out to the porch where it became a substitute for a bowling ball and a basketball. No problems at all... So it is pretty safe to say that it will survive all normal drops and abuse.
5151	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have bought one of this notebook but in a smaller size a year ago. I like the color and the quality of the notebook. It is classic and well designed.
1208	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	On day three, but love it so far.  Very clean and simple, but effective.  Sticking to the pomederos has been helpful to me.  Love the clean layout.
6260	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I purchased these to start my Bullet Journal journey in an affordable way. I love the Moleskine Cahir Journel set. I am using one as my planner, one as my collections notebook and I haven't started the third one yet. If you are considering joining the BuJo craze, this is an affordable way to test the waters.

1510	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I intended to take this multifunctional tool with me on a camping trip.  But sadly it did not arrive in time for the trip . . . arrived about 2 weeks later.  So I haven't been able to take full advantage of all the tools and features.  But I have been using it around the house and it has been helpful!
566	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I find that the "pockets" are not as deep as I would like them to be.  I have an older Carson Dellosa on that I like better.  But it does work and is durable and will last a long time.
Previous reviews indicate there may have been shipping issues that resulted in damaged maps.  I'm pleased to say this was NOT the case with my order (and more recent reviews also indicate Amazon has fixed the problem).  The map arrived securely rolled in original plastic wrapping inside a very strong-walled shipping tube.  PLEASE NOTE: I purchased directly from Amazon... so I can't speak of how any third-party seller is shipping.

1339	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Overall did not write that well!
So far, I'm pretty happy in the Moleskine. The quality and the texture of the paper isn't particularly excellent for the price though; production in China is not up to par there. If you pay a premium price for a Notebook, you should expect premium paper, so look for these on sale.
1162	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I find everyone likes to hear 'Thank You' when they help or do something for you. Storing up on as many interesting and well designed Thank You cards is important for me. I was happily surprised to see that these were well made and include an embossed lettering that makes it stand out. They are made with heavier card stock and well made envelopes. I hope they design additional interesting thank you notes in the future.

The negatives - it's not laminated, now if I was buying this for myself that would be fine, but the paper is also some strange form of paper that attracts and holds small sticky fingerprints. Being maps, little fingers are naturally attracted like magnets.
Even if you have a TI83 or higher, I recommend having one of these in your bag just in case.

269	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Does the job.  It is big enough for my purposes and the fold flat or fold and stand is great. And I can turn it on it's side or lay it down, opened up and there is a lot of surface to work with.  Being two sided is also a net feature.
5535	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this item to use as a family diary.  I just jot down a few things here and there as they occur.  I first record the date and then a short 1 or 2 line entry.  As this volume fills up, I will purchase another and I hope to enjoy looking back through it someday.  It is nice how these notebooks come in so many colors.  I like the small size of it and that it has an elastic strap to keep it closed.  It also has an attached bookmark to keep your place.

7536	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It is so hard to know what exact calculator the high school teachers want. I lucked out and one major points and getting this one. My daughter said it was the exact one she needed for high school geometry. There's also a great price on this calculator as it seems to be much less than some of the other ones with more letters and numbers behind its name. Even better, I was able to get it same day with the qualifying order. That makes it much easier than running out to the stores looking for one. The calculator itself is nice and sturdy and has a slide on, slide off protector or cover. This cover also has some directions inside of it for solving different calculations. Overall the perfect buy!
5650	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great notebooks. I like them better than the Field Notes brand. These are the same size, but have a little pocket in back to hold business cards and similar items. The second half of notebook pages are also perforated for easy tear-out. Great product.

3720	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	At 11.5 gauge, these hangers are extremely sturdy.  A lesser gauge, such as 13, would be a sturdy hanger.  These would support the weight of a heavy overcoat and snow pants without flexing at all.  Unless you have a special need, these are overkill.

Allows for quick use, and I don't have to look down b/c I can feel, easily, if I pressed the button I wanted or not, and keep it moving. I love that I have a free hand and can stay focused on my placing in a list while I use it. And I use it about 30-1000 times a day.

UPDATE: 5.6.17 - This planner is seriously helping me change my life. I love the section for tasks and the weekly layout. I don't use the time slots much, but I do list things that I did on any give day in those areas. I bought the 8.5 x 11 for work, and I don't like it. It;s too big and not spiral bound. I can't wait to order spiral bound ones for the new year. I am very picky about planner...I mean - extremely picky. I've tried to use them for years. I've tried bullet journaling in a all sorts of notebooks, and have tried a variety of planners. This - THIS - one gets my stamp of approval. Bless you folks for producing this. I'm getting my life back on track, and am feeling productive again in my personal life.

5310	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I was very hesitant to drop this amount on a simple notebook, but the 3 months of premium swayed me.  So glad I did!  The notebook is both nice looking and well constructed, and I love the Evernote theming of it.  There is a whole system to integrate with your Evernote notebooks and create automatic tags/sorting via the stickers they provide - I think it's more gimmicky than particularly useful, but I did confirm that it works well.  The photos that are taken of the moleskine pages come out super sharp on Evernote too.

The map is not as "old" looking as what it appears on my computer screen but is still a great item.

My suggestions:
7639	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Good calculator
4720	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Is small enough to be portable, but large enough for on site sketches. Size is 5 x 8.25Great with pencils (and erasers), pen and ink, Sharpies. The paper is a little heavier and absorbs the ink without bleed (165 g/m - 111 lb paper).
9701	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	fantastic!
5405	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This was purchased as a gift and the recipient really enjoys it. What I love most about these Moleskine versions are the little things that can be find throughout the book. One cool piece included in this is a quote on a long piece of paper.

2851	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	As a teacher, this has been a lifesaver. I used to make gigantic lists. Lists everywhere!  While this helped me keep track of everything I needed to do, it  was a bit overwhelming. This product forces me to limit the things I can do in one day. It forces me to realistically look at what I can get done. That way I now plan accordingly and still manage to feel accomplished. :)

3872	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	My boyfriend bought me this knife because I kept complaining about how my knives wasn't sharp enough. Instead of buying me a knife sharpner he bought me this Rachael Ray Rocker Knife. This knife as a nice grip and very sharp blade. I love to cook and I have used this knife to chop up my vegetables and cut up a whole chicken in pieces. I love this knife so much that I order another one and also bought some of Rachael Ray cookware. This knife is made of good quailty and very durable. The only thing with this knife is you can't put it in the dishwasher, other then that it is a keeper.  I would recommend this knife for anybody who is looking for a great  sharp knife .

7645	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This HP works really well and is very handy, powerful, and flexible financial tool. If you are an engineer you will probably have to get used to a change in notation. It appears the calculator is laid out more for financial professionals day to day use than engineers studying engineering economy. Probably should be that way. One of the great things about this HP and most others is that there is a quick reference guide printed on the back.

There's "The Beatles 1" CD, the one with the #1 hits. A good value for a lot of songs. No bad, but, for the Beatles and a few other bands, getting the original album is a better choice. The songs are best heard in context, in an odd way, like a Pink Floyd album. Besides, on "Sgt. Pepper," the songs are all incredible. A bit funky, but intensely enjoyable. A compilation won't meet the need.

About 25 pages were crumpled in the corner due to inadequate protection in packaging - the corner got dented. Paper is less likely to get jammed up in my printer due to weight. Inkjet printing looks good on it.  For me, it is definitely worth paying just a few dollars more to have better paper, and delivered to my home 1. for convenience, and 2. so I don't get caught up in impulse buying at Office Depot.  Needs better packaging.

Quality of the 3.5 quart saucepan is excellent.  There are 3 big rivets holding the cool-V handle in place, and there's an additional smaller handle as well, but take note that the smaller handle will get hot when you cook.

It comes with everything needed: paper (any 8.5x11-inch can be substituted), protectors, and dividers with sticky labels that can be applied to the tabs to customize categorization.

4667	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love Moleskine products, quality made and nice looking.  It is about the size and weight of an average paperback book but with a hard leather-like cover.  The new series they have called "Passions" is such a great idea!  This one, called "Music",  is one of 6 (the others are recipes, wine, books, wellness and film).  It has 6 tabbed areas to fill in which can be personalized, plus sections for music notations, blank pages, adhesive labels and an inner pocket for small keepsakes (ticket stubs, paper clips, etc.)  I can't wait to collect the other products in this set.
6487	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Like this planner alot, I do wish it was a bit bigger but for the price and the amount of detail, I can deal with the size. There's a column for weekly tasks, as well as tasks delegated to your team, in additional to time slots throughout each day.
Pros:  Great size... it's big enough to easily identify all states and cities.  The coloration is very well done; it's colorful without being either too dull or, to the other extreme, obnoxiously bright.  Lamination indicates you can write on / wipe off with with a dry-erase marker.
Raises wrist to an acceptable level, keeps it neutral. Took some getting used to, but once adjusted, I'm happy with the results. Relieved wrist strain.

3982	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I am a long time calendar keeper...I have had them all through years of office and sales positions.  I am retired now and still prefer paper, at least as a backup to the electronic on the computer.  (This summer the computer crashed and all was lost...)  I purchased this to jot down the important things like vet and dental and recurring birthdays so they would not be lost again.  I am enchanted!  The book is a great size, the paper is very nice and I love the weeks, which includes a listing at the beginning for any major projects or reminders about the weeks' focus.  I am able to actually keep my to-dos in the book and cross them off during the week.  This has minimized other note cards and means I can also jot down my grocery list as the week goes by...I only have one note and that is that while I am able to clip my rollerball inside the wire spiral to keep along, and there is a front pocket for some things, it would be lovely if the front pocket had a flap to keep things IN...there is a tendency when handling the book for slick things like calendar sticker pages (such fun!) to fall out.  Maybe a flap with a tiny round velcro?  I also would like another insert somewhere that has a folder on the bottom of each side.  Like a mini report folder that my grandkids use.  This would allow for other documents, pictures and what nots to be added and carried as needed. (I would like to be able to carry my medical emergency docs in this too, just in case I should fall out in the store and the paramedics want to know the details)....Other wise, it is cute, not too heavy and fits right in my bag.  Oh, and if ALL manufacturer's would stop writing things in Yellow Ink, like the memorable quotes that are completely lost (is it ONLY ME?) due to the inability to actually SEE them.  I really don't have time to sit and try to sort them out every week.  Who Does????  And for a side note, why do restaurants always use brown ink on a brown paper now?  Same issue.  CLARITY, People.  If you want us, the consumer to buy it, make it easier to read and use.  Anyway, for a go-to book that really does help keep one organized and is useful enough to save other paper lists, I still give it 5 stars.

906	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very happy with this laminated map. I got it to help visualize/plan several trips this year as we are in the college search process. It is fairly thin, but I have not found that to affect the quality of the product. I use vis-a-vis pens to map our routes, they are easy to see and wipe off cleanly. The map is big enough to easily see major cities in each state and see the state boundaries, but is not large enough to map out routes on specific roads...you'll need a more detailed map for that. I like that there is also plenty of room in the border for me to make notes as to length of drive time between our stops...it just gives a handy overview of the plans.
I especially like the red cover. I use this one for notes on Ferraris - one of my passions and a subject I write about for Forza magazine.

It can withstand watercolors, Gellyroll pens,  markers, etc. without coming through on the other side. I use this notebook  as a fauxbonichi  type journal and I am amazed at the quality. Thanks for such a fabulous product!
That being said, here are the pros and cons:

1934	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	ok
The overall thickness of the book is greatly reduced from the moleskine sketch which makes it much easier to slip into a thin bag, such as an ipad bag for example. It is a very thin sketchbook. The horizontal accordion folding makes it perfect for extended panoramas. Basically, you are no longer limited in width of page since it may be extended on the go. About the paper: it appears to be equal or slightly thinner than the moleskine sketch paper. Sakura Micron pens or similar are the perfect media for this paper. You can saturate a bit with the Microns and not bleed through making the back side of the paper usable.
It should be noted that you can use regular Moleskine notebooks in exactly the same way with the Evernote page camera to capture notes. So, while I think the green elastic and embossed cover make it worth it for me, you'll have to decide that on your own.
1060	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	We are military and buy the gazeteer for every state we live in, hunt or fish in.  This one is huge!!! And it is still the same price.

458	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I understand that these reviews should be based on the PRODUCT, but people just need to not purchase this particular map from Amazon.  As other people have complained about, I received the darn thing in a plastic bag. It was crumpled and creased beyond repair so I sent it back.  When I find someone else selling this map I will purchase it from them, hopefully they understand the benefits of cardboard tubes.  The map itself was exactly what I wanted.

Love these for mechanical engineering classes and degree I am working on. The 36X pro is allowed on the FE exam (Fundamentals of Engineering). So just another plus for this calculator
I fully recommend "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."

Because the world changes so rapidly now, I decided to order maps large enough for a 6 and 10 year old to look at and comprehend, but cheap enough to be replaced once the borders of various countries are re-done.
5570	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works perfect for my travel book.
7977	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Difficult to navigate and void of features that might separate it from the usual TI-30.  Many of the buttons on mine were this cheap, imitation-metal plastic that gleamed in the light and didn't have any print on it - hard to see or use under the eye of an exam clock.  Take a deep breath and go for the graphing calculator, TI-84
- Much thinner than expected; even with the lamination, no heavier than some inexpensive folded paper maps I've gotten in the mail.

That aside, I can remember the first time that I heard Sgt. Pepper as though it was yesterday. It was a Saturday afternoon and I was at home listening to music.
This album/CD virtually screams out THE BEATLES!!! and I cannot think of a better Classic Rock investment which one could make.
I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.
7773	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Easy to use.  I like the built in cover feature with the removable use guide.  The buttons are big enough to key info easily and the overall size is small enough to fit in a coat pocket.  All this for under $10!  Can't beat it.
I have never oiled the unit or maintained it in any way. I know I should but I don't. I had to call tech support one time when I thought it had died. Turned out I just had it in the basket wrong. And I got through to tech support quickly --- even after I was out of warranty.
If you purchase this product be careful not to stick the tab to the other side of the page until you know that no other pages are sticking to that page. That happened to me a few times but the stickers were easy to remove and place again. Another thing to be careful of is to carefully remove the stickers from the peel off sheets and to evenly fold the stickers when placing them on the Bible pages.
4780	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Cute little notebooks. Item as described

The calculator is encased in a protective plastic cover that removes from the calcuator and can be either placed to the side or slid onto the bottom of the case to avoid losing it. The keypad has good feedback, nice feel.
Just be aware that the D-shape handle is designed for right-handed people only. Similarly, like most Japanese knives, the blade is ground with a right-handed bias. Shun also sells a left-handed version, but this is not it. Amazon should note that in the description.
8113	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I needed and works perfectly.  It was delivered fast and has gotten me through my classes.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a graphing calculator for school!


7151	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	total crap.  didn't last at all in my fax machine, which doesn't print much.  save your $$$ and buy generic toner for like $18.  It will be the same crap but much cheaper.

9284	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this after I realized that the base of palm was beginning to ache.  The pain is now gone, and I am confident I have avoided future problems.  A wise and economical solution!
5633	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I'm a big fan of Moleskin products, in general, and so my first impression was "Where was this when I was working on my PhD a few years ago?" However, on further examination, I realized the product was lackluster. Here's why:
3205	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	These are awesome for helping my three-year-old during our daily "learning time." I just use post-it notes in the pockets to easily change from numbers, to letters, to colors, to shapes. My son loves that he can throw them around, and they make "learning time" more fun!
5454	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Moleskine notebooks are known for their construction and the quality of the paper used within them. These Evernote Smart Notebooks are no different in that regard. I use Moleskines daily for note-taking, journaling, and sketching. Love them.
2904	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Cute note pad. I used it in a saran wrap ball.
7341	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great for my nearly 4 year old who has already traveled quite a lot in his life. He can now see where all those places are on the globe and he loves to show to everybody where he was born, where he traveled, where he lives now etc.

8672	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Smaller than expected but it does the job.
The week being laid out on one page, with a corresponding page for notes, provides the perfect amount of space. I used to have a larger calendar, but found myself writing EVERYTHING in it. The smaller size of this Moleskine helps me keep focused.
There are a few  things I love about this device:
5724	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Moleskins are quality binding and paper
8463	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this paper for my grandson to use for finger painting. The write-up says it is heavy construction paper. It is not. It is very flimsy paper and I returned it.
9002	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love this.  It has saved my wrist.  It is so much better using this than not.  The mouse works much better, too.
1299	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Really cool and bright colors.  Mix of pink, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple with one of each, plus some had 2 of that color.
932	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	It's a great map with lots of detail. The details get lost when looking at Alaska, but otherwise it looks very nice. The gloss finish is also nice, though it would be better if it were laminated. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good wall map of the lower 48. Alaska would really need its own map to do the state justice.

3898	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a great deal on this coffee especially w/ subscribe and save. It is a very mild coffee and if you have issues w/ reflux it is very low acid and I have not experienced reflux w/ this coffee. I ordered the medium roast and started mixing it 50/50 w/ another brand of organic decaffeinated coffee that I purchased locally. If you are a french roast or Starbucks fan, you probably will not like it being so mild. I do have to use more beans w/ this type which I did not when I used this brand's Peru decaffeinated light roast which I also found to be low acid.
5960	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great art book, hold ink and graphite really well. Good for everyday sketching and mabye even inktober

9590	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Excellent. Comes in very handy.
5632	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I've always loved reading.  I can't remember not reading.  Like many, when I was young, I read certain authors, then certain genres.  But then I ran into a problem.  I was reading too fast for the good authors to keep up, and sometimes did not know what I wanted to read.  So I got myself a subscription to Entertainment Weekly, and used that plus emails from my local library to read book reviews to decide what to read.  I've gone through several spiral bound notebooks over the years, keeping a list of books to read.  Once I finished reading, I crossed the book off.  This served me well, or so I thought.

4095	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love Shun knives, and this is one of my favorites, the edge is razor sharp, the handle is solid steel and the entire knife has good balance and a nice weight to it.  In addition the dumascus steel folding on the blade provides a nice aesthetic bonus.  From personal exprience with this knife (I bought mine around Christmas last year) I can safely say that it holds an edge well and makes difficult tasks like qubic butternut squash fairly easy.  This 6" knife is perfect if you or your sig-other has small hands, but makes it less than ideal for cutting a watermelon or fabricating meat.

7378	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered another calculator to replace this one. I'll keep it as a backup but the shape of this thing is horrible, it rocks around due to the curves when sitting on a desk and trying to use it, and is not ergonomic when holding it. Also due to the extra width and slippery shiny plastic, it is impossible to use one handed as when you reach your thumb across to hit a button on the far side, it slides out of your hand because there is no texture to it.

I suppose the only reason I've used so many of them was because I just wanted to a good notebook and they sure *seem* like they'd be good when you pick one up in the store.  Like Mulder on the X-Files, I really wanted to believe in Moleskine.  And I wanted to give the product an honest chance before giving up on it.  But now I'm convinced they are not worthy of my good notes.  Maybe I'll use the ones I still have for mundane stuff like shopping lists or something.  They COULD be a good notebook if Moleskine could just build a durable binding.

My problem came in dealing with Chefs, the seller.  When I was shorted a carafe, I called Chefs to explain they'd made an error.  No big deal, we all make mistakes.  But the CSR did a horrible job in dealing with his company's mistake.  At first, he refused to believe me.  I asked to speak to his manager.  He put me on hold for a good 5 minutes, then told me his manager wasn't available.  So, I asked for the manager's voice mail, since the CSR was being difficult.  All of a sudden, the CSR believed me and told me he'd ship me another carafe immediately.  I finally received it about 3 weeks later and missing the event I'd ordered it for.

8071	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I got this as a junior in high school.  I'm now a junior at one of the service academies.  I think I've had to replace the batteries once in that 4 year time frame.  I am an operations research major (read applied math...), and this calculator has absolutely everything needed for any technical major.  Being able to integrate is real helpful when you want to prove something works to yourself, or just check your work.  The 3-d graphing is also amazing.  I used to have all the games on it, and they work fine.  Don't get this to pass time in class... a palm pilot has better apps.  If you have any aspirations of being an engineer or math major, this calc will help tremendously.  Definately worthy of your hard earned $$.
7663	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have a few HP-12C's. I use them as an assessor and some quasi-appraisal functions such as amortization of loans and valuing cash flows. The newest one I have is much faster than the 25th anniversary version. It's not because of one having old batteries either, I switched them back and forth and the results were the same. My 25th anniversary edition uses only 1 battery, while the newest one uses 2. So it's not the exact same calculator from the 80's anymore, it's the same layout and functions, but the newest ones are faster, they do IRR's on 20 cycle cash flows instantly.

5160	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very well made product, with a very nice attractive color. I'm all about the details when I'm paying a premium price for a notebook. The truth is, you don't need to spend so much if all you care about is something to write in, am i right? But if you want something special, this is money well spent. So, to the details: For me the paper remains the most welcoming of any of the notebooks I have. Yes, there is better/thicker paper, but the Moleskine paper is good in its own way. It's 120 sheets of paper in a tight package. Because of that, there's some see-through, but it's not bad. The light-cream colored paper is opaque enough and the narrowly-spaced, ruled lines are sufficiently dark so it's not annoying when you use the back of a page. The pens that I use make a nice bite into the soft paper. I like that. It's one of the small pleasant details. The yellow orange is my current favorite color, even more than the red. The black notebooks can hide in plain sight, but this one isn't hiding anywhere.
The book is the size of their standard large journals and is embossed with literary terms.  Very elegant!  It comes with the standard Moleskine pocket (where the stickers fit nicely), elastic band, a Moleskine book mark for your current reads,  and 3! ribbon book marks.
3611	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	So useful for filling baggies and jar and everyday things.  Who knew?
"The paper has the perfect weight for card stock.  The paper fed through my printer with ease each time (not too thick), and it worked well for double sided printing with no bleed through.  Both black and color ink printed perfectly.  I would purchase this brand card stock paper again."

The only thing I don't like, but fully expected for the price, is that I believe this to be faux leather. Still, it's not cheap plastic or vinyl. This feels very durable. I'm very confident in saying this.
9808	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	If you're a baby boomer you've encountered this staple gun somewhere along the way.  Reliable, heavy duty, and does the job.  Sure, there are refined versions of this stapler out there from different manufacturers, but the fact is this gun gets the job done at the lowest cost, given those competitors.  Would I want to use this all day?  Nope.  It takes a strong pull to bang that staple home.  But for the price --- and reliability --- it can't be beat.
7497	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	It doesn't feel the same quality in my hand, but I could overlook that if I didn't have problems right from the beginning.  It works for a while and then shows Pr Error; I reset it, but that only works for a few minutes.  I have been using the same HP 12C since I went to work for FDIC in 1986, almost 30 years.  I never once had any problem with it.  It has been a dependable workhorse, but finally gave up the ghost.  So, I'm incredibly disappointed.  I did, even though it came with batteries, order some new ones for a backup.  I just put those in and in the 10 minutes I've been using it it has been okay.  I am NOT going to be continually draining it with a dime in the battery case.  If I have to do that, I'm returning it.  I want to use it.  I don't want to think about it.

You will see a number of reviews for this and other sandpaper where people complain about either the disks coming off the sander and/or the media not lasting long.  Consider what they are sanding and wonder what they are doing.  All hook and loop paper tends to get hot in use and this weakens the pad on the sander to the point that IT won't hold the sandpaper.  This can be made worse by putting a lot of pressure on the sandpaper which causes it to "load up" which in turn causes more friction and more heat.

The paper is the same, it is exceptionally sturdy as all Moleskines and the very roomy pocket makes it nice for storing other artwork flat.  I loved this so much I also purchased the A3 size pockets which are great for flat storing smaller paper works!  Do yourself a favor, take the hit and give this sketchbook a try.

A final note.  Moleskine notebook apps have recently been released for the iPhone and iPad.  The app design is not yet there, in my opinion.  But I have high hopes for the future, though I will keep using the books, too.  It seems a good idea to download them now while they are free.  You will likely be "grandfathered in" to the improved commercial version when it appears.

What makes this pan so much better is that the edges are extended on the ends to provide sturdy, rigid handles. This makes it easy and safe to remove hot pans from the oven.

5209	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I'm so happy I got this notebook. I'm in ceramics and this is the perfect size notebook for me to do my sketches and jot down my ideas while working in sometimes messy environments. The quality of the paper is awesome, and I can jot down stuff in the notebook with wet clay hands. My old composite book would start wrinkling if it got wet.

6125	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I bought this because I was tired of working hard on my sketches only to find that the paper I was sketching on wouldn't last long. I feel like this is probably the most high quality paper you can get for art. I feel like this book will last my entier lifetime, by this I of course mean the quality, there are only about 100 actual pages in the book. It is a beautiful hard back that has an awesome texture of leather to it. You really feel like you're drawing in something important when you use this book. The price may seem high, and in all truth it is, but compared to others, and for the money, you really get what you pay for. I'd say this is as close to perfect that you can get if you want a high quality book to keep with you over the years and sketch in.

I think I'll take a chance.
This map is absolutely beautiful and looks awesome framed and mounted. It shows many cities and towns in every state, it also show rivers and relief.  It identifies the major mountain ranges, shows most (if not all) National Parks, National Recreation Areas, National Monuments, mountains with their elevation, and much more. I can't express enough at how great this map looks and it was only $10.xx!  We've traveled to most of the US and are embarking on a 22 state trip during the summer of 2014 and we found out a pack of 100 map pins is not nearly enough.
All this means that when I head out into the field to take notes, I've always got a pad I can count on to perform. A when I finally fill one up, the old one goes on the book shelf with my journals (something I'd never do with cheap, "fall apart" flip top note pads) marked with "Beginning Date - Ending Date". These can be hard to find in bricks and mortar stores, so when I do need a new one, I hop on-line and order another one ... or more. My most recent one arrived when I had only 2 pages left in the old one.

As a bonus, the Belkin mouse pad has a fairly small footprint, so it fits well on the limited space available on my keyboard tray.

There are two design shortcomings. First, the sides of the skillet are too vertical. It is not possible to "toss" well while sauteing. If you only "stir" this is not a problem. It would be better with more angled sides. The second shortcoming is that the handle has a small, awkward loop, which is hard to hang on a pot hook with any other pans.

6543	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I've been using this Action Day calendar for several years.  While I find no calendar perfect, this one is excellent.  Normally, I would give it five stars.  But, the cover material has changed, and I don't care for it.  I think the cover might be more water resistant now, but it is harder to open/close the calendar.  The cover gets caught on the wire binding, and I have to fiddle with it a bit.
1700	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered three of these calendars. Have been buying them for years. This year one of them had the first 6 days missing! I don't know how hard quality control is but it was embarrassing as I gave this as a gift to someone in Italy and it is kind of hard to return it from there!

9789	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Like I said, this is a pretty decent stapler. Fairly easy to handle and they last pert-n-near for ever. I've had one for many years then the spring that pulls the strip of staples forward got all kinked. This one is a little different so the spring cant get all stretched or kinked. The one drawback is its power. For the longer staples it doesn't drive them all the way in sometimes. So you have to carefully tap them in with a hammer which can leave hammer head marks and pretty much defeats the purpose of using this stapler to avoid leaving hammer head dents in your project. If it was a little stronger then I would give it the full 5 starts.
3265	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great for our homeschool schedule.
If you're an Evernote Premium user anyway, and you like note-taking, then this is a good choice for you -- the 3-month extension gives you some of your money back.  But otherwise, I'd say that there are many other notebooks available that do the same thing for cheaper.

8146	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love making cards from home. Nice quality paper.
4995	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Nice paper quality. Love the paper color as well--it's not that white that makes your eyes feel uncomfortable, and it's not a too yellowish shade which may make your handwriting blurring. I know I can always trust Moleskine. Highly Recommend.
They're thick, their durable, and they totally look legit enough that non-medical minded people will take a double take. I have a few official letters after my name which adds to the realism.

4761	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It's a nice little pocket "reporter" notebook. Medium-gray hairline ruled .234375 in on cream paper. Stitched binding. Pocket on inside back cover for whatever. Best use with ballpoint or pencil, rollerball will show through. (As usual, pricey for what it is as are all Moleskine products, no doubt making a killing as they're all now made in China for pennies on the dollar.) Yep, I bought it anyway, mainly for its small form-factor.
6796	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Typical CROSS quality. I honestly am amazed that these are viewed as inferior to MONT BLANC pens. I have both and the CROSS writes better, has a better feel, costs far less and is metal versus plastic. The twist mechanism is smooth and the size is just a bit larger than the original CENTURY.

3145	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I wanted and needed. It is bright and colorful. I love that it has real world examples i.e. Circle and clock and pizza. It really helps a visual child put it all together.
My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g., has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times.
MY RECOMMENDATION
In summary, you will be very happy with this map.  And we will try to remember to come back here and post a picture or video of it once we get it up on the wall.  If not, it will be on our web site.

I got one for my Mom's stocking, and then reordered one for myself. The plastic, protective sleeve it comes in will keep it around a long time, even when it's not between the pages of your latest read. And putting the whole thing into a plastic bag for secure shipping in a padded envelope makes it even better. Recommend.

They show women and people of color frequently throughout the months. There's lots to look at and read, including many fun facts. It also features important historical events in space science as well as important events for sky-watching. I'll definitely save it after the year is through.

The 49G may be powerful, but using it is extremely counterintuitive...and the manual was sketchy at best.  The 12C, on the other hand, does what I need in a way that makes good sense to me.
1985	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I like this planner. It has a few extra lesson plans and examples of class and board work. Plenty of room for writing plans.
The gel pad is covered with a nice low friction material, is wide enough so that your wrist isn't stuck in one position, and is neither too hard nor too soft for comfort.  The part of the mouse pad where the mouse runs wild and free is also covered with the same low friction silky material so the mouse can be moved easily.  It is also cut wider at the top so that the mouse has more room to move, while your arm doesn't have to move as much.
8758	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I liked t his pad a lot. It has a slick surface so the mouse glides easily and it is very nice to have wrist support.
2137	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	They do what they are meant to do. It's nice that they came in an eight pack because you always need multiple bookmarks
5039	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I don't know how or when I found Moleskine products but when I did, it was love at first sight. Everything about their products says "quality". As a writer, the wonderful way the paper feels in your hand and how it takes ink and pencil lead makes me want to write.
4589	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Have these since Xmas and they still disappoint.
- As all other Moleskine products, binding quality is top notch (that alone justifies the higher price of Moleskines, I think); this notebook won't come apart in decades at least, no matter how rough you treat it.
2. There are only 30 meeting notes pages.
I highly recommend this for anyone with young children. If you need super thick stencils, try the Melissa and Doug ones made from wood. My daughter has those, too- but they are SO thick that she has a hard time getting her pencil in all the nooks crannies to accurately trace the object. I honestly think these are the best stencils out there for kids and I have looked all over town for something similar to add to my daughter's collection and can't find anything like it.
6792	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	A little heavy
It's solid, it's dependable, it uses a great notation format (RPN vs Algebraic) and I really like for form factor too.  If you really want to get into it, you can add programs and set up all kids of custom features but I don't bother with that.  The basic calculator does what I actually need and it does it VERY well.
8752	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Works nicely
I'm no expert for all of this, just someone willing to share his relevant experience. My personal preference is either the 12 or 18 month layout depending on what I know about my next 12-18 month projects. The great thing is that you are buying a product that will last for much longer than 18 months so durability is not an issue. My next preference is pocket vs. large (pocket is perfect size for my uses and large at 10 1/2" when lying open is too much for desktop, portability, etc. To the contrary, the notebook/journal/diary is perfect in "large" but not the planner.

3659	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have bought a few sets of these Majestic Brushes. I try to buy when the price dips a bit. They are very well constructed for the price. And they are versatile. I am a beginner, so cannot yet justify investing in more than just a few quality brushes--until I develop skill and good brush hygiene.  All of these majestic sets seem highly reviewed.  I need to learn WHAT sizes and TYPES I most use for each media. So, these Majestics, and also the Aqualons and Supremes from the same company offer lots of sizes and types, for media across the board. A good way to gain experience, without breaking the bank.  I have bought a few Escoda, DaVinci and Silver brushes, so I can experience what a really good brush feels like.  I also like the Princeton Value pack with the orange handle.

4295	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is the nicest journal I have ever seen.  The journal is about  inch thick and the pages are outlined with gold.  Each page has a different scripture at the bottom and isn't too tiny to view nor too large and takes up  of the journal.  The front and back look like real leather, although it is not and it has the names of Jesus etched in black on it.  It even comes with a nice vinyl book cover too keep it looking nice.  I got this as a present for a friend and they absolutely love it, I plan on buying many more for family and friends.
5586	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Moleskine Volant Notebook are great notebooks. This set is small enough to fit in a pocket or a purse. Works great as a little travel notebook
6886	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Cross is always excellent.
6695	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I have seen many people in Bible study and had to get them for myself. Makes finding verses in the Bible very easy. The tabs were very easy to install, and they come with a guide to help you get them in just the right spot.
These Thank You Cards from pretty.simple.cards are blank folder over note cards. They are 3 1/2 inches by 5 inches cards when folded over and 7 inches by 5 inches when unfolded. On the front of the card is a simple "Thank You" in the lower right corner and inside they are blank. Being blank on the inside leaves you the entire card to write a message. The cards come in a plastic holder so that you don't have to worry about the cards being loose and getting messed up. The cards are made from card stock paper that has a slight texture. The back flap of the envelope might seem odd to mention here but there are two things about this flap I wanted to point out. First, the flat is not the typical triangle/pointed design but more of a rounded rectangle. I think this gives the card a more expensive look. Second, the flap is self sticking! You peel off the strip and stick it down. This is a wonderful feature to add to these cards! These are quality cards and have the look of expensive, boutique cards.

7556	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Feels a little cheaper than the original but still essential equipment and I am very happy with it.  Would buy it again.
When I opened the package, the calculator itself had a coating of battery acid turned into powder form. Unfortunately at the time, I didn't know that's what it was. The calculator was also emanating an odor. I put it to my nose and whiffed. This may sound unbelievable but I subsequently must have inhaled some small particulates of the residue and my throat started to hurt within minutes. Long story short, I ended up calling the poison control center.
4888	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I bought this as a gift.  She loves it!  However, would I buy this for myself? No.  At 4/5 stars, I would say it is worth the price for most people just not me personally.  It just does not go above and beyond to amaze me.  And it probably has to do with my field or work and my way of thinking which requires a lot of reworking the problem.  For such an expensive notebook, I am a little scared to run through the pages so quickly.
5110	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the wrong size.  It's a great little book; just not my size.  My mistake.  Other than that the product is good.

3483	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I wanted some cheap coasters that wouldnt stick to my glass and these fit the bill. Other types of coasters will stick to a sweaty glass but theres no such problem with these. Theyre black, dotted and made of a sturdy rubber material. For the price they're hard to beat.
5489	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I set out determined to find a journal with several important qualities -- it has to have lined paper, a usable bookmark, a durable cover, and a handy size for journaling. As most of the product reviews indicate, this one has it all and I plan to be a repeat-repeat-repeat buyer.
8780	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love this wrist rest for my mouse pad. Helps when I'm using my laptop (I like a separate mouse for my laptop) in my room without any hard surface to put it on. The mouse pad is very useful.
2793	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Simple, just as pictured! Coworker loved it!
879	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	First, this thing is very large - 4 x 6 feet. Heavy duty paper, shiney, but non-glaring, finish. Arrived without a bit of damage, well packaged in a heavy plastic tube inside a sturdy box. Since it is heavy paper, it is not hard to manuver dispite its size. It's an attractive wall hanging. Very detailed, but remember it's not a road map, major roads only. The type is easy to read without reading glasses. Our driving limit is 500 miles at a stretch, so this full size map makes it easy to rough out a cross-country road trip without having to flip pages or use more than one map. It is also interesting to see where stuff is relative to the rest of the country and our home. If you like geography, maps, or travel, and you have a large space on the wall, this is an asset.
The learning curve is a slightly steeper (but only ever so) with this calculator, but if you need a calculator that can perform time value of money problems in a fast and efficient manner, this calculator is a must.
8447	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	my kids love art and this paper is a big hit for their desks.  Now I am writing to fill in space.
769	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	great selection
1923	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great for my journal:)
8506	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Very good and easy to use. Although it is different from what I used before, it still very easy to do calculations for my chemistry test. Like it.
I have found these miniscule glasses, however, to be ideal as special jars to hold some of my make-up implements, including brushes, eye pencils, and other such tools. I have scattered them about the house to hold writing instruments, as well, and other miscellaneous items. They are delightful to look at, and in their service as containers of otherwise mundane items, they transform the ordinary function of storage into an expression of ornamental art.
3196	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Great quality, has many different uses.
4330	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I generally love the calendar. The blocks are nice and large, without lines, so I can write or draw whatever I want. Love the pocket and that it's the school year.  But the stickers are lacking in some areas and go overboard on others. I just setup the calendar for 2018 and I counted 42 birthday stickers, in addition to 21 party stickers. A sticker for every single day of spring break, assuming your break lasts exactly as long as the number of letters in the words spring break." But no holiday stickers - no Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Mother's Day, etc. and no first and last day of school.  Every year I end up using plain stars for just about everything and throw away 90% of the rest. That's the only thing I'd change, and I keep buying it year after year so it's not that big a deal.

6368	Office_Products_5	NEG	2.0	Was excited to get these for my bible. Found that all colors but yellow bleed through the pages, not just a little, but a lot. So where I highlighted, the back side of the page looks like I highlighted that as well. The yellow was the only one that did not bleed through, but I think that is because it is almost dried out. There is hardly any color with the yellow.
8841	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Good but wish the mouse area was a tad larger
The biggest concern I have about this is that it looks like a pocket knife/multi-tool.  While this shouldn't be an issue, the fact is, I work in an airport and will travel to other airports from time to time.  I don't want to be carrying anything that is going to be considered suspicous.  That being said, nobody has said anything to me when I do carry it and use it even post security in the airport.  In the 2 weeks since I got this, I have been though 6 airports security lines and not once has it been flagged for additional screening.


8028	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I got a fabulous image from NASAs Hubble Christmas card page, and made a few modifications and used this paper to print Christmas cards, and it worked beautifully.
Overall, this is a very useful notebook that can easily be adapted to different uses.
214	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Our 2 year old girl really loves this book! She doesn't watch the show often, but loves pointing out all the characters and saying goodnight to Peppa and George.
7929	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	THE PRODUCT IS OF EXCELLENT QUALITY. It is COMPATIBLE WITH THE TEAM. PRINTS ARE VERY GOOD ONE SHARP. I highly recommend it.
9498	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	It works well and I can use it in my accounting class as well (since it isn't scientific but can do amortization and annuities) My only complaint is that we had to configure the settings step by step with the teacher - if I hadn't been in a class I wouldn't have known how to do that at all. It is a reliable calculator that has worked well for 4 tests so far, as well as regular homework.
These are pretty and cute. Not a bad purchase.
218	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A bedtime favorite - everyone loves Peppa.
9797	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I'll be using this staple gun for odd jobs around the house and occasionally reupholstering chairs. It will be perfect for holiday decorating and such. It's lightweight, easy to handle, and hasn't jammed on me once.
The paper makes for smooth writing with pencil or pen.
5031	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Love these notebooks! The graph design is printed in a soft grey color, so it's not overpowering, but still very visible. I cut them down to fit into a standard size Midori Traveler's notebook, and they work perfectly.
1553	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This pic turned out fantastic... NO MIXING so I loved that....
If you or someone you know is an artist and wants a quality sketchbook to carry around that's durable and attractive, check out this one!  It's great!
1. Not for anything but basic math functions but is fine for my needs.
3869	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This cutting board is so pretty. I bought it because I have been redecorating my kitchen with red. This one was perfect. It appears to be well made. The pattern is great. The red tomatoes are bold and that is what I wanted, but the greens are vivid as well. Very pleased.


1524	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Its tiny, but so super cute!!!
6.  Overall size was big enough for write good detail, but no so gaudy big that it wouldn't fit in my purse.
1955	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	A really nice (small) "book" full of examples of beautiful zendalas, some strings, and patterns. If you're going round, this is the way to go.
3044	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	I'm a huge fan of pretty much anything paper related as I make all lists, plans etc the old-fashioned way - and Knock Knock pretty much has the market cornered to a T. Not only do their product cater to whatever function, interest or humorous penchant you might have, the paper is also excellent quality - not flimsy like other I've bought. I own probably about a dozen different variations of this particular type of product (meaning the size) - ranging from the basic to do list to packing view decision-making etc. I also have post-it versions and smaller lists. To date, none of these Knock Knock notepads have ever let me down and as a product I would rate them a solid 5/5 without hesitation.
1656	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	This was for my staff as a thank-you for all you do... They loved these book marks.. but they are a bit small!
8266	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great.  Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant.  I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.
510	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is awesome.  Does not take up much space.  Can be hung with just some thumb tacks!  Very lightweight.  I use it to file the disposable grocery ads each week, and to keep a folder of grocery coupons I may or may not use from time to time.  Or, to hold on to magazines until I throw them out.  Or, perhaps to hold random pages of magazines I've ripped out, to remind me of the next hairstyles I want to try out on my husband.  :)  Election mailers and voter information stuff that I collect until I really delve into them...Or ongoing coupons to Kohls or Costco...you get the idea.  The bottom files are for the kids to put some of their school documents in, so they always have a spot to put stuff they don't want to lose, like upcoming field trip permission slips or homework they are working on, or whatnot.  It has never fallen down off our wall, in over a year, despite the load we have used it for!  Anyway, it's not really attractive at all, but super functional.  Love it.

5840	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I use this for journaling and I love it. Looks and feels like a Moleskine.



Original March 30, 2014 Review:
517	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a great set! However, I highly recommend laminating it and attatching Velcro to the pieces! My preschoolers love this weather panda!
9.  Well written manual.

A few of these I will use myself, but the others I'll save for Christmas gifts since they make great stocking stuffers, and maybe tucked inside a gift book.  If you love books, you'll love these.  They come in animals, flowers, even a peace sign bookmark.  A fun item to mark your place when you put your book down.

5184	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	If you don't know about Moleskine, you should.  Each of the many varieties comes with a pamphlet telling the "Moleskine story"; how writers and artists used to choose this notebook during the 20th century to record ideas, sketches, poetry, whatever.  The original company that made them in Italy stopped making them a few decades ago; a new Moleskine company began making them in 1997.  They come in endless varieties of the original notebook:  ruled, unruled, grid paper, music notation paper, etc, in a variety of sizes and colors.  The square bound notebooks have a hard cover, band and ribbon bookmark; Moleskine also produces various sizes of "soft cover" notebooks which are staple bound.  The paper is always acid free.
All-in-all, the picture on the Samsung had a good picture, but it did not have near the picture clarity and color vibrance that the Panasonic has.  Additionally, this Samsung model has and "electronic program guide" - not to be confused withe the "TV GUIDE" version.  Needless to say, the Samsung version did not work and requires each channel to transit their program information and that just does not happen.  The Panasonic TH50PX500 does have the "TV Guide" version and it worked great.  Finally, the split screen cabability and integration capability with other Panasonic products put the Panasonic over the top when compared to the Samsung.  One last thing, the Samsung remote is very minimal as far as capability goes.  Panasonic has this beat hands down.
6580	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I am so happy with his calendar. I've been using calendars for 25 years and this is the first year I've tried this one in particular. It has a short section at the front for goalsetting and time saving ideas. Pretty cool and unexpected! This is also one of the best efficiency manuals I've ever seen. It has an elastic band that keeps it together which I love. It is black and sleek and fits into my book bag well. The pages are thick and the sections are divided well. There are two pages to a week and I see everything upfront. It allows me to plan out my life on a daily weekly and monthly basis. There's also a section at the cover that allows for yearly planning. This is for sure one of the best, if not the best, calendars I have ever used and I plan on getting another one next year.
I've been using Derwent's Inktense pencils on this notebook, and the paper allows the pencil colors to really shine. I love how bright the pencils are on this paper. The paper has a bit of teeth but when you add water, the inktense colors smooth out and you can't tell that the paper is not perfectly smooth.

My only complaint is the advertising picture shows a ream
The ribbon pagesaver is very handy and the elastic keeps it reliably closed.
4241	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	use it daily

7703	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	I love it as much as anyone can love a calculator
9207	Office_Products_5	NEG	1.0	Where's the gel? It's a cheap dollar-store mouse pad.
6852	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	Can't beat the price!
6091	Office_Products_5	POS	4.0	Nice ruled and small enough to fit in a purse. I bought it for my tangle sketches but it is better just to use as notes since it is ruled and the paper is too smooth for sketching.
2985	Office_Products_5	POS	5.0	This is a good gift for anyone who takes their library seriously.  It is also a bit interesting teaching children how these work.

3 levels in total and by that time I expect they can read cooler books like Mo Willems.
