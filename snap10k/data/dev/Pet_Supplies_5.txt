After I brought her back from the vet I filled her two litter boxes with Yesterday's News. The pellets are a little larger than I thought they'd be for a cat, but Samirah adjusted very quickly. I completely changed out the litter in the boxes after three days, washed the boxes out and put in fresh litter. I'm very impressed. I poured the used litter into a garbage bag and the weight was lighter than clay litter would have been. The sides and bottom of the litter pan was a little dusty.  Clean up was a breeze, very easy. The pellets absorbed the urine and swelled up slightly. Solid waste was no problem, either. No large soggy clumps to scoop out. I would highly recommend this litter, especially for single cat households.

-No more bending down to pick up the ball with your hands! Yes, you still gotta bend a little bit (if you buy the short version), but not all the way to the ground anymore.

Also you do not have to have the chuckit balls to throw you can use regular tennis balls.  However if you want the longevity of the ball I would by the rubber chuck it ball to keep launching.

Cesar's corrections consist of a noise "shhhh" and a brief tug on the leash. Cesar works with the type of collar the owner has on the dog. That may be buckle, choke, martingale, or pinch/prong. None of Cesar's corrections are physically damaging to the dog. Incidentally, the prong/pinch collar is not a cruel device when used correctly. It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a "beep" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.

5649	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I prefer the pocket launcher over the full-sized one as I can throw it in my back-pack or even put it in my jeans pockets when we go places. If your dog is just a back-yard dog, you may not need the smaller size, but for an active adventure dog, this is a GREAT product. I use it with racquet balls a lot for my medium sized dog, since tennis balls are like sand paper for your dog's teeth. Less dirt/sand swallowing, less saliva, higher bounce.
This price offered for this is very good too. If you buy it from you vet, it will probably be at least ten dollars more, so it is worthwhile to purchase it here.
The Chuck-it is perhaps the best dog toy since the Frisbee, especially for dogs who love to run long distances to retrieve. That describes our golden retriever, for one, a dog who almost prefers chasing tennis balls to eating. Now anyone can heave a ball a long, long way so that your dog gets a satisfying workout and a more challenging retrieval. Just pick up the supplied colored ball (or a substitute, as chances are you will lose it) raise your arm high over your head and back, then fling it forward, with a slight punch at or near the top of your swing. The ball will travel far and fast. It may take a few tries, but it's not too difficult to learn. With practice, you can aim the ball well, and control the distance and trajectory with fairly good accuracy (much more so than hitting a ball with a racket). The Chuck-it is flexible and I've never broken one. Of course, for very short distances, or for a more intimate connection with your pet, you can still pick up the dog-soaked ball and throw it yourself. Highly recommended!

Pros:
4375	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	Great toy to throw balls for the dog. He loves it. It is a bit stiff which makes it great for throwing long distances but more challenging to throw short distances. Still does the job. It's better than bending down to pick up the ball and touch it.
Third: this works well as a front-attaching, no-pull harness! The front ring is in a good position, just high enough on my dog's neck for me to clip it to my her collar (for safety) at the same time when we go for walks.

To get your cats to accept the new litterbox very fast: set it up with litter beside your present box, but leave it unplugged. Manually scoop it for a day or so. Be diligent. Don't scoop the old box at all. Then, plug the Littermaid in, and turn on the switch on to rake, and off when done. Do this for a day or so. Then start leaving the switch on for a few hours and off for a few hours. If the cats go in the Littermaid while the switch is off, go turn it on after they are done and admire their progress. Continue to keep the Littermaid clean all week and leave the old box smelly. Cat naturally prefer a clean box.

Now another reason I took off a half star is because of the price. It's ridiculously expensive.  I can buy a 50 pound bag of junky dog food for 4 pounds of this.

The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours. But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before. I'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half.

It is covered in little bumps that look very easy to chew off, so I was a little skeptical on how this would hold up, but I like it because it cleans their teeth. I gave it to the occasional chewer, and she sniffed it before slowly grabbing it, chewed a little while, and left it alone. She hasn't chewed on it much since. The crazy-mad chewer likes it, but not as much as the other bone. He was chewing it one night and from the sound I thought it would be gone in the morning, but no, it is still holding up pretty well. A few of the bumps have come off, and some are stretched, but overall it is doing well for my dogs...and protecting things I don't want them to chew on.

3064	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is such a great product. I had ordered the medium size, but ended up giving it to a friend that has MS and could not walk her 2 dogs. Now she can and loves it.  I highly recommend it. I have carpal tunnel and am a bit uncoordinated :-)  I kept dropping the leash so much that I thought I could not walk my dog any longer. But after I bought this, well, lots of walks. I bought the extra large size so my 85 year old father could also use it and at times walk my dog. He is much larger than me. The extra large can be made much smaller so it fits me also. Great product.  I am now thinking of buying an extension so my dog can at times wanderer more.  At this time, we connect another leash to the system to give her more length... and that works great also.

3733	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I've found. They are much sturdier (you won't stick your hand through) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up. These are pretty good sized, so it's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.

The seller rated this product "good" so I was hesitant but ordered anyway because of the great price (under $8 for the entire first season). I was ecstatic when it arrived only a few short days after I ordered it and in my opinion was in "nearly new" condition. I appreciate the sellers honesty regarding the condition of the outer casing and would not hesitate to order from this seller again. I greatly appreciate the speed and integrity in which they demonstrated with this fantastic DVD series.

3093	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	we got this to have hands free jogging w/ our dog.  it does what is says - but the clip that attaches to the dog's collar actually broke easily once it had a strong pull.  in the end this is just a leash with a belt - so you can make your own if you already have a leash and a belt.

I never go on walks with the dogs without a couple in my pocket (and often an extra one or two to share with those dog parents who just maybe didn't think about the fact that they should pick up their dog's business).
3669	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is the best poop pick up bag around.  I'm kind of a germaphobe and very squeamish when picking up after my dog, but this bag provides plenty of protection so I don't accidentally touch it with my bare hands!  Easy to use - goes on like an oven mit, then just pick up poop and pull hand out, thereby turning the bag inside out, then twist and throw in the trash. It's big enough and easy to pick up several pieces at a time.
I decided that since they love Lambchop so much, I would try to give it a face transplant.  I sewed a piece of chamois cloth over the face and used permanent markers for the facial features.  It may not be as cute, but it doesnt tempt the dogs to rearrange the features either.

He is very close to remission but may not reach it because of the dry food for the last few years. too bad- if I had only known sooner. He has lost at least one pound as well.
Program is a pill your pet takes once a month for preventative measures.  The Capstar is a pill you give your pet at the first sighting of a flea.  It says it starts to work within 1/2 hour, mine worked even faster.
Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.

And even though I've only been using it for a short time, I'm very happy with it.  It was definitely worth the extra money to get this ramp as opposed to any of the others.
1636	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Arrived on time and in good condition.  Looks to be a good quality knife at a fraction of the cost of a forschner.  I plan to use it for filleting salmon.

My 70-pound female Golden Retriever had a hot-spots which the vet said could be coming from food allergies, recommending we switch to no chicken, no wheat, no corn in her food.  She eats this dog food with gusto, but then she eats everything with gusto, so it's probably me who likes the brand more than she does.  The ingredient list starts with lamb and ends with vitamins. I believe it is very good for her skin and recommend the product to friends.  Also available on Amazon subscription, which makes this Prime shopper very happy.
1658	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This is a well-made, fairly easy to use flexi-leash.  What I don't like about all flexi-leashes is that it teaches the dog to pull; therefore I won't be using it.  However, for those of you who like flexi-leashes, this is a well-made, one-button leash for large dogs.  The unit is kinda heavy, but has to be if you're walking a 100 lb. dog.  I never really got used to the button for stopping and holding the leash because I used it 3 times before putting it away.  I have trained my dogs to walk without pulling and by the third time on the flexi-leash they were all starting to pull--not good.  I will go back to carrying a 20 ft. training lead for when they want to off-road; it's not nearly as heavy and I have an easier time on recall. The 4 stars rating is because it is well-made, retracts quickly but is heavy.
5977	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This feeder is a good product and much better than the feeders that I have tried in other brands. The motor is quiet and the construction is durable. It is a little bit of a challenge to get the lid open the first few times you try but after that it is easy. However our cat sitter has never learned how to master the thing and leaves the lid off and feeds by filling one tray at a time when we are away. I would recommend this feeder to anyone.

After measuring my back seat multiple times, I concluded that the cover would fit, but it would be tight.  Turns out it's about 4 inches short, about 2 inches on each side.  Not the end of the world, I can live with a couple of inches of seat uncovered.  Cause my dog isn't going to hit those exposed inches on either side of the cover.
Another advantage -- you don't need much litter and it goes much further.

9252	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	This product is NOT GENUINE! I noticed that the kibbles were 3x the size they normally are from the exact same bag I get at pet smart. My cat would eat then violently throw up afterwards. I had to take her to the vet because this gave her an allergic reaction and was having problems breathing! My vet figured out that it was the food. She said ahe gets a lot of issues from people ordering off of Amazon lately. There must be some scammers on here. I love Amazon, but this really hurt my cat and cost me a ton in vet bills. I bought blue buffalo from pet smart and my cat loves it and hasn't had any problems at all. Buyers beware on Amazon!
The difference in the " pro " is the handle has a nice grip that doesn't slip in rainy weather etc ! I like the 26 too but the 18" is my favorite)
Only thing I wish was different is the material on the back feet, is is like a mesh and holes appear there before anywhere else on Lambie

Even though we tried to keep them separate, our cat sprayed a wool area rug in the room where we moved her scratching post, to warn the kitten to stay away. We tried to get the smell out with various carpet cleaners and the steam cleaner, but it remained. We then treated it with the Bissell Pet Stain & Odor pre-treat stuff and steam cleaned the rug again. Voila! Odor gone! I was otherwise going to have to throw out the gorgeous rug that I designed the room's decor around, so I am thrilled with this product. Thank you, Bissell, for saving my rug!!!

I laugh -- one cat I have insists on coming back inside to use the Littermaid. He was a neighbors cat and disappeared when he was a year old. He returned a year later and adopted me.

6735	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I'm so happy I found this.  My breeder mentioned pine bedding so I bought that and then read about concerns about pine fumes.  Worse than that fear was the mess everywhere- the pine shavings would stick to my lionheads fur, spin about the room, get in the water bowl, etc etc etc.  I was sweeping the laundry room twice a day to gather the shavings.  This is SO much better I couldn't be more thrilled.  No more bits everywhere unless they do a binky or get startled in their litter box and this litter comes out with their kicking, which is rare.  My girl bun did try to eat this at first but now seems to know its not tasty and not food.

6485	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I decided to buy this scratcher after I read the reviews here at Amazon. I picked it up from my local PetSmart, and boy, it sure does work! I put a little bit of the included catnip on it, and my kitty jumped on the scratcher like, well . . . like a cat that's smelled catnip. I've had it a few weeks now, haven't added any catnip since that first day, and she still loves scratching. I think she's clawing the sofa and bed less, but I'm not sure, since she can be very sneaky and could be doing it when I'm away. However, when I am home, I just pat the cosmic cardboard scratcher, and she pounces on it and picks on it like a good cat. In other words, I give it two thumbs up, and my cat I'm sure would give it two paws up as well. Oh, and one more thing, I think I will buy the refills, but it seems like the current set of cardboard will last at least a few months, but like I said, I just recently bought this and can't say for sure. Hope this helps.

Well it's ok.  Still have to clean it out because it does not pick up all the waste.  When my cat goes in the corner the waste is not picked up at all. It also takes a lot of litter out when it cleans so litter has to be added often.  However, it is better than cleaning a regular litter box every day.  All in all I like it better than a regular litter box.

1) The belt is relatively thin. The first time I put it on, my dog (a lab) got really excited and decided to pull really hard, which left my midsection feeling a bit bruised and battered. A harness (for the human) might make it a little more comfortable. On my dog's end, there are no complaints that I can tell. :)
4261	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	The Chuckit is great - makes throwing the ball for your dog SO much easier, and the ball goes further than we would have thrown it.  The only complaint I have is the ball itself that comes with it.  My dog (50lb Cattle Dog/Husky mix) was able to check the ball apart.  If you have a strong chewer, throw away the ball and use regular tennis balls.
9648	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	As a veterinarian, I can tell you that cats do better using their litter box when they have enough space. This works quite well for that.
1639	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My cats have been on this food for 14+ years they love it and I don't have to buy too expensive or too cheap. This is just right and keeps them healthy.

1042	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	The Droll Omni Seed Tray easily screws into the bottom of the Droll Yankee tube-style feeders, and collects the spilled seed.  It's great for a new feeder, too, since you can sprinkle a bit of seed in the tray to attract birds to your feeder. Cardinals prefer the added perch that the tray gives them, so I was pleased about that, too.
3514	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product!
6268	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product in both forms for several years with my now 12 year old Labrador retriever! He has arthritis in one of his elbows from an old injury. I often take him south for a couple of months in the winter and I think because of the humidity, he could hardly walk by the time we got back. After using Connectin, he can take several hour long hikes each week and never is sore or lame afterward! This product is amazing!! I did start him on the "initial dose" for the 1st 2 months then went to the maintenance dose. It took about 3 weeks before I started to see results.
One of the best features of the launcher is that I no longer have to handle a soggy ball.  When she drops the ball at my feet, all I do is scoop it back up in the launcher and throw it again.  At the end of the session, I scoop it up and it lives in the launcher until the next session.  This is such an incredible bonus they should charge extra for it.

My dog went for it with gusto, though I know there are dog owners out there whose pets are a bit picky about food they're unfamiliar with. My dog has literally never been hesitant to dive right into any food presented to her, and this was no exception. But I felt confident that she was getting a healthy meal here - we almost always serve grain-free as a rule (and absolutely always corn-, soy-, and wheat-free foods).

She's been on this two month now, and I have noticed a definite improvement in my hip/joint issues.  She's much more perky and playful again, will run, jump for hugs, and just generally is happier!  And all of this has helped to contribute to some exercise for weight loss.  Highly recommend!

Our kitty has some really big, sticky output that the last one would get stuck in and either just sit in stripping out its gears or reverse and run back and forth. This one doesn't even sound like it's straining and just powers through.
6862	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I mix this with my Lab's dry kibble a few times a week in an effort to keep his weight down. He loves food in general so I can't rate it based on if he'll eat it or not. The ingredients look fine for him, therefore 5 stars.
6222	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is great dog food. It's what our vet recommended when out Boston Terrier was a puppy and he's been eating it ever since. We change up the flavor that we buy occasionally, but he really seems to like the chicken. It has normal kibble and then larger pieces of chicken mixed in that he goes crazy for. He's a very healthy little guy.

This is what all my cats do every year--and they're INDOOR CATS!  I have no clue how they get fleas, but every year we go through the same process and they start to drive everyone crazy with their insane licking, their disgusting slimey hairball slugs and their tufts of hair all over the place.  However, this solution actually works:  Advantage Topical Solution Flea Treatment.

Love this but my dog loves it even more!! We call it Chuck. I say where is Chuck and she runs to the garage where we keep it and then the game is on. Have had several of the balls too like the orange ball that whistles real loud the best..
8872	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog has incredibly strong teeth and loves to chew rubbery toys - to the point of destruction.  The Kong toys are the only ones that can weather his chewing... and this one is particularly strong.  The grooves in the rubber seem to feel really good on his teeth because this is one of his favorites - he will go to his toy box and pick this toy up first most of the time, and just sit and gnaw happily on it.

My only complaint with this bag is that the retaining strap used by the seat belt is on the wrong side of the bag.  When placed in the car with the strap to the rear, the air panel faces the back of the rear seat, not the front of the vehicle.  In order to use this successfully in the car, the seat belt now has to strap over the front of the bag, so my dog can have visibility and better air flow.  Sherpa products are great, but this one needs a moment of thought for a simple redesign.

7659	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My two cats eat this food like there's no tomorrow. I bought the chicken selection and they lick the bowl clean. This is un heard of especially with my older cat who is a gravy eater. She licks up all the gravy and leaves the food, but not with this brand, she scarfed it all down! The best part, no intestional upset with the change in diet. I'd like to think it's because of the food, but I have had my cats on a daily dose of ProViable for a few months and I think it makes the difference. Either way, I'm glad I tryed this brand, it seems like quality food that they both like.
9127	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	My cat absolutely would not eat more then one bite of the Mixed Grill and eventually pretty much stopped eating them all together. preferring to eat the dry kibble all together. the only way I can get her to eat and finish what is left is to mix it with the flakey bits that have more gravy. The pate is just to pasty and doesn't go down as well as the gravy variety and on more then one occasion would get caught in her throat causing her to gag and vomit. If left for any period of time it would dry very quickly making it nearly impossible for her to get off the saucer should she try to come back to and I usually had to throw more away then she could eat and I only feed her 1/4 can in the morning and at night with dry Friskies and water available to her 24/7. Left overs don't store in the fridge well either and must be chopped up as once refrigerated it clumps together were as the flakes of meat in gravy do not  I can also find it cheaper at the local Kroger's and with a bigger variety of flavors unlike being forced to buy 3 specific flavors and one of which she won't eat at all. The flakes in gravy don't smell as strong as this stuff either. And I care enough about my pet that if I wouldn't eat anything that smells as bad going in as it does coming out then I sure wouldn't eat it and there is no way I'd expect her to do the same. I know she sounds like a finicky cat and maybe so but sometimes the smell of this stuff in the morning would make me gag as well.

I'm glad I bought this, if only for the ability to drop the leash from my hand sometime and still know the dog can only wander off but so far. That said, there is one issue with this leash that causes me to short it on perfection. The leash rotates to far around the belt (as in all the way around) that it makes it hard to train the dog to remain on one side of me (as recommended in dog obedience). Therefore I wind up holding the leash with my hand most of the time. And because the actual loop is on my waist, not in my hand, it isn't the easiest thing to do when the dog starts pulling.

  With Propac, what you see on the label is what you get. No substitutions. Period. Chicken meal and fat, ground corn, flax seed, beet pulp, yeast culture and vitamin/mineral supplements. The ONLY preservative is vitamin E. Since my pooch isn't a 'working dog', she eats a fraction of whats recommended on the label. One cup twice a day maintains her svelte 75 lb figure. This dog food is a rare find nowadays: a reliable, quality product with the right price for my wallet.

The Pocket launcher is great for our back yard , with little effort I can toss the ball over 100 feet. We have a mini-Schnoodle that is crazy about playing fetch, he could keep going until my arm fell off.  In larger spaces I prefer the longer Jr. Launcher which I have no problem hitting the outfield fence from the pitchers mound of our local little league field so I can only imagine what the full size launcher can do!

This one he prefers to carry around with him and toss about rather than sit and chew on. He cannot resist the "oh, no!" sound it makes, and a person squeezing this toy sends him into a frenzy until he manages to get it.

For those of you who still have a Litter Maid and hate changing the trap, I discovered a method to make the task easier and much more pleasant. I'd simply use one trap over and over again, and use a regular grocery bag as a trap liner. When the trap was full, all I'd do was lift the grocery bag (leaving the trap locked in its position), tie the handles and toss, and then replace with a new bag. The same plastic trap would last for several months (and I'd only end up tossing it if it got dirty). Since you never have to deal with removing the trap, it doesn't get cracked and you never have to buy replacement traps (I still have about 8 of the 12 original ones that came with my Litter Maid)

I inadvertently adopted three puppies within three months--all abandoned at my place of work. They are now 11, 13 and 15 months old, but when I found the last, they were 3, 5, and 7 months, and one of my big challenged was finding a toy that all three could play with and not destroy instantly. We tried rope toys, but those last about a day at best. Fabric toys were good for five minutes. I tried some of the softer puppy Nylabones, which were great for the littlest--a thirteen pound Dachshund/Chihuahua mix--but terrible for the other two, a thirty pound Red Heeler mix and a sixty pound Rhodesian Ridgeback/Pitbull mix. I would label all three of my girls as medium-aggressive chewers, and these things have saved my life--and my stuff! They do break pieces off, and I sometimes have to pick little white bits out of my carpet, but I've had no medical or tooth problems (as reported by others) and it's great to have a toy that everyone can play with! Every couple of months I order three more, and they're always delighted to have fresh new toys. Plus, you can't beat Amazon's price!

Shedding has decreased significantly. I rotate between the Chicken & Sweet Potato and the Lamb. I also feed the Wellness Kibble. They absolutely love the food. They are healthy, energetic and shiny. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. No garbage in the food. Pure. Natural. Wellness has us as a lifetime customer.  I used to cook chicken breast, carrots, apples & sweet potatoes (mixed) for my Pugs daily. I have serious mobility issues and not always able to cook for them, leaving them to eat Purina One kibble.

The ball itself tends to crack along the seam, at which point my dog can't help but tear off the fabric. I find it frustrating that they break, but I have not found a better ball for my dog that is safe indoors, safe for him, and lasts even a couple of days. My dog is small, and these are just fine for his gymnastic catching routines.
The last point I want to make is about the comment of his technique.  Some viewer regard it as old school.  It is probably true but then it will always works as long as following the leader is still in the DNA.  This is still true today for pack animal such as lions or elephants.  In fact, all those so called new technique does not work well for abused dogs.  I believe Cesar's method covers a much more variety of situation.
I like that they are biodegradable so I am not adding to the landfill problem.

Recommend this product because even though it isn't produced with top of the line ingredients it isn't the worst when it comes down to it.  It smells rather nice for a dry dog food and even though he is very picky, he will tolerate this brand mixed in with his dry food instead of running and hiding.
I tried several other launchers but none one close to this one!

2111	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I hve 5 dogs and I would like to think I love them all the same but it's not true.  One of my dogs, Prue, has seriously made me question whether all dogs go to heaven or some dogs have a special place they get to go instead.  I still love Prue, however, and, once a year, I buy her a special gift.  Every year, Prue gets a new "Toy Toy." Toy Toy is a stuffed lambchop toy that the dog adores.  The dog can jump up and bite my nose repeatedly most mornings (I wish I were joking) but she has a special fondness for this 10" super plush stuffed lamb that I cannot figure out.  She carries it around.  She squeaks it's middle and it's paws.  She cuddles it's soft plush head.  She is very protective of it and won't let the other dogs de-stuff or de-fuzz or de-squeak it.  This goes on for months.  She carries the toy, which is almost bigger than her, in her mouth until, inevitably, she turns her back for too long and our meaty 18 pound de-squeaking monster of a dachsund grabs the toy and runs to a place where Prue can't get to Toy Toy.  For weeks after, Prue will carry around the empty carcass of Toy Toy until she brings it outdoors and it can't come back inside because it is dirty.

The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the "max fill" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.
5361	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I have gotten products like this before and they were terrible. This one actually picks up the balls and man can you launch those balls. My dog loves it
It does take a bit to get used to as far as the noise of the rake and what it takes to do a through clean.  But, as I like them so much for what they do that I don't mind the maintenance. Which isn't as involved as it would seem. It's actually rather simple to clean with a wet handrag and the occasional vacuum or dustbuster (which can be said of almost all litter boxes)

5994	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this feeder after my cat broke the LeBistro brand feeder I had by repeatedly sticking her paw up into the food dispenser to coax more kibbles out. The design of this feeder prevented that, but it was clunky in other ways. I had to remember to fill it again every few days by guessing when I had last done so, because you cannot see which of the hidden trays are empty. Since I could not figure out how to lift the tray cover, I had to rotate it by battery power - very slowly - tray by tray - to refill each one. The batteries lasted several months, but when they began to run down, I could not for the life of me get the center console with the motor in it to "lift" out (as per instructions) to put in new batteries. I pried it with a screwdriver, rotated the cover to each tray in turn, shook it - nothing worked. After two frustrating days, I finally sent it back to Amazon with the dead batteries still installed. It was useless. I would not buy this model again.

Other dogs I know who are on it are also quite healthy.  When we run out of it our senior dogs seem less comfortable.

5926	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	I had to use customer service as my "advance button" wouldn't work (it happens) and they were phenomenal!  I did test the feeder to see how well it would keep wet food cold and it did a pretty good job.  I would suggest you 1) fill the ice packs with water and a touch of rubbing alcohol and freeze them well in advance.  The rubbing alcohol SHOULD give the ice packs a bit of extra "cooling" life, 2) put paper towels (or the like) under the ice packs when placing in the feeder; as condensation will form 3) mark the feeder slots, so you know which one is to be used when you are setting the feeder timer/turning it on and which one will be the 1st feeding (which the feeder will open to IMMEDIATELY after turning the feeder on).  4) fill the latter feeder slots with wet food, add some water and freeze, those in order to ensure they will still be cool, but not frozen when it's their time to open.  5) ENSURE to test the feeder with your pet WELL in advance of when it will be needed with you not there.  There are a few Cons: 1) the timer can only be set in 6, 12 or 24hr intervals and as soon as you set the time the feeder "opens" to the 1st slot and starts the timer clock.  This can be an issue if let's say you need to leave for the airport at 4am and your pet normally eats at 7am (and 7pm).  Basically you would have to have to set the feeder on the 12hr interval, to open at 4am/4pm as there is no timer delay (AGAIN as soon as you turn on the feeder the 1st meal portion is opened.  2) the ice packs top is a push down top and should be a screw top as getting them off can be difficult.  I found getting them on is easy IF you fill the packs, put the top on, use the under side of my kitchen counter and push up to close it.  3) My pet hasn't done this but others have commented that their pet has figured out how to move the top of the feeder to get to the other portions, before the timer moved it (plus some have mentioned the pet has even moved the entire feeder, probably when trying to get to the food).  4) the flip top to the timer don't lock or snap shut, but I haven't found this an issue (and if I do I will just put on a piece of tape or the like before setting the feeder. 5) The instructions were printed very small, so I went on line and printed our a larger version from there - plus the instructions are so-so, as it wasn't clear how to access the ice trays - FYI - remove the timer housing, remove the white cover, then separate the feeding portion tray from the bottom (there is a line) and presto you found the ice trays.
First, multi cat homes need checked daily, not necessarily changed, just checked.  A large cat can't aim the center of the box, especially portly cats.  They being large cats end up hitting the very end of the litter area with urine then the machine sweeps and it then clings a clump stuck to the plastic.  This only happens once in a while when the cat is facing the machine area and his hind end toward the hopper.  Otherwise, the other reason is a not totally clumped chunk of whatever that gets caught in the teeth then rides back to the original position where it dries and then becomes like concrete.  A good brand of litter helps cure some of those problems.

8089	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My puppy loves it! Was shipped quickly and packaged well.
The opposite happened with my kitten. None of the cans were dented, but she often walked away from it and begged for something else. I know it's not the chicken - she likes everything else with chicken. She does like the dry version of it though. Wellness is a good brand, just not what my kitty likes to eat.
6515	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Wow!  First of all, this was at our door two days after I ordered it.  That was great.
We have three of the wretched creatures: Amanda, Sissy, and Rags. They're finicky eaters, and, moreover, their individual preferences are out of sync. A fair amount of left over wet, i.e. canned, food goes down the garbage disposal. (Dry food is generally less problematic from the standpoint of acceptance, but that's another story for another time. If Amanda fills an empty stomach on dry, she often throws it up. Last week, it was on the window sill and into the groove into which the open, vertically sliding window would come to rest when closed.)
Through trial and error, Everclean litter is a great alternative to the brand that littermaid sells ... sold in pet store and amazon.

When I was filling my feeders the other day, I accidently bumped one of my feeders and knocked it off of it's high perch and on to the ground.  Oh, oh, I thought I surely would have broken the seed catch, but not a scratch was found on it.  That's some tough plastic.  Thanks Droll Yankee.

Recently, it just does not have the power to get over the hump to get the waste into the receptacle, or it catches and "things" go flying everywhere.

The items that come with the two kits are as different as night and day.  With the beach body 21 day kit you get videos and a recipe book.  These may be useful, but I am not sure it is worth the extra money.  This kit (healthy packers) says you can visit their website for a personal meal plan and recipes.  I think this is all you need to make this meal plan work.

6143	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Edit a few years later - yes, they finally changed the photo to be a ramp the front seat, when the photo I purchased from showed a long ramp to the back of an SUV, which is probably why they got 35% reviews under 3 star.  So-they changed the photo to be more true of that size and acting like no other photo ever existed.  I did order the longer size and it did work for the back.  Just a hassle to ship back and so on.
This has probably been the only item I have ever used on a daily basis and still have as much need as I had the first day I bought it!  I have recommended this item to friends and they seem to think a ramp is  ramp.  Some of their ramps are too steep (short) for an SUV - some are too narrow for our 65 lb chows, and some get either slippery in the rain or hot in the summer.  And some are hard to put away.  This ramp doesn't have any of those limitations.  I am pleased with this purchase and hope you will be too.  And FYI - I paid about the same price 10 years ago!

He seems to like the resistance to his teeth and with this around he won't even go for the tennis balls. They fit perfectly into the plastic launcher that we purchased with them so we never have to touch the slobbery balls or quit throwing. Win for Ted and my family.

Anyhow, going by the label, the ingredients look good. To me, it does not smell awful. When I get the chance I am getting rid of it by feeding it to stray dogs.

My other cat V is thin and just a nibbler, and is very curious and athletic, her seperate, open food dish is up high, so L can't reach it, and so V can nibble all day. If I put V's food in this timed feeder, I have no doubt she would outsmart it and/or break it open in a day.

8507	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	Only one of our 6 indoor and chubby cats even made an attempt at eating this! I was shocked because their diet is usually dry kibble, and if they get canned food it is usually received as a treat and gobbled up. But the other five just sniffed at it and walked away! I must say the food was rather chunky and I tried mashing it up a bit for them, and it didn't have a very appealing smell. Now I am left with about 20 tins of this stuff and only one cat that will eat it. Must say I am very disappointed and I wish I knew what it is that is turning the others off this food :(

4) minor problem is that the capacity doesn't allow for you to use lotsa litter, since the rake can get stuck.  so if you have cats that pees a lot (like mine) the litter can get used up really quick and you would have to refill almost daily.  also the removable receptacle is really flimsy.  so it's kinda hard to reuse without breaking.  forces you to buy refills.
2086	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Made very well. Our dog has not been able to shred, pull apart or pluck out the fur. Quality squeakers, our dog has not been able to bite holes and damage squeak noise. Very good for small breed. Durable.
7706	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	I have been feeding my 17 year old bichon Wellness for about three years. After the first year, people told me he was looking/acting healthier than ever. Knowing I could get it shipped by Amazon has been so helpful and the price is good. Lately, however, I have been receiving NUMEROUS crushed cans within a delivery. The whole case is NOT damaged. The cardboard is perfectly intact, and the plastic wrapping is pristine. When I start to take out the cans, however, I find ones that are so severely damaged, I would NEVER use them! I must admit, I have NOT contacted Amazon about this issue, but I will. If they get their act together on the mangled cans, I will give this a five star rating!

When my husband and I first opened this new bag of dog food, we both said "oh gosh, what is they smell??" It had a STRONG smell what I keep labeling plastic. I can't put my finger on it. I thought it was just us being weird. I proceeded to feed the dogs, they didn't eat. it's been a few days now, and it seems as if they just hate this food. They eat what they have to and are done, whereas they usually clean the bowl. I've tried it with coconut oil, their vitamin mix, and even cheese and they just will not eat it.
If you have a dog that destroys toys, well I don't know if this is really gonna hold up for you, but with mine it did. Please keep in mind I can see no explanation for its durability, the stitching is nice, but it's still a plush stuffed animal. By all accounts they should've destroyed it by now.

And our pup is  not an aggressive chewer - all of our other stuffed toys are intact.  :(  I fear this must not be well made for it to have come apart so easily.

5580	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog is obsessed with balls and playing fetch.  She is also a really tough chewer.  The tennis ball that comes with it held up as well as any other tennis ball; not at all.  I also purchased the Chuckit! glow ball which glows super bright and holds up to her tough chewing.  Zoe has trouble dropping the ball for us but has much more confidence in letting her ball go to the Chuckit! so we don't fight her as much for the ball which was a unexpected but major benefit.  Other than that, it works as described; it picks up the balls easy and goes really far.  I wish I had gotten one years ago.  The price on Amazon is fantastic and the free two day Prime shipping got it here as promised.  Best investment ever!

1294	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I have a friend who has a Littermaid, and has had no problems with it, but mine broke within a couple days.  However, I did buy mine used from a yard sale, so that could be part of it.  It worked fine at first.  One of my cats likes to use the litter box right on the edge of the box, and the Littermaid doesn't clean that area very well.  My other cat digs A LOT in the litterbox.  Whenever he went, he would pile up all the litter in one big pile.  I think that's what killed the motor.  He also was used to more litter than what you're required to use for the Littermaid.  He likes to dig deep.  I have a CatGenie now, and I absolutely LOVE it.  I know it's much more expensive than the Littermaid, but it's worth it for me.

1123	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it won't work with my, and my cat's, favorite litter.  Yes it's a clumping litter.  Also the tongs on the rake are very wide.  This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin (even with the smallest clumping litter I could find).  It wastes a LOT of litter, pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it's path into the bin... more of a shovel, than a rake IMO.  In order to not waste more litter than is used, I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter.... far more of a hassle than useful.

Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline, it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals, young kittens, etc, etc. My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage.

I also recommend this product to clients that are having trouble with leash pulling, as it helps prevent you from allowing your dog to pull your arm in different directions. You're strongest at your trunk (around hips, waist) so it gives you better control of a pulling dog and they are less likely to pull you over, though I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with lower back issues.

I must give credit where credit is due - I have used Frontline before for my cats, and have been very satisfied with the results from that one. However, I decided to try Advantage this time, as I'd heard good things about it, and it was on sale at a discount when I needed it. I couldn't be more pleased. Unlike most other topical applications where the flea substance is put on the shoulder blades of the cats and stinks (STINKS!), this has no easily discernable smell.

The first time I used it I almost threw the ball over the trees into the horse pasture next door.  It is easy to throw the tennis ball close to 75 yards.  This thing really launches the ball with very little effort.  Great for these light weight tennis balls which always seem to bother my elbow when I throw them.

My Flat coats and my aussie love it.  I have recently bought a small one iwth a rope for my maltese,
Another plus: it doesn't stink. Usually cat food with crappie ingredients tends to stink, and in turn makes their poo stinker. Since eating this, and switching their dry food a grain free brand, their litter boxes aren't as smelly as before (still smell, but not ass bad).

We have three of the wretched creatures: Amanda, Sissy, and Rags. They're finicky eaters, and, moreover, their individual preferences are out of sync. A fair amount of left over wet, i.e. canned, food goes down the garbage disposal. (Dry food is generally less problematic from the standpoint of acceptance, but that's another story for another time. If Amanda fills an empty stomach on dry, she often throws it up.

The reason I gave it one star is ecological. After going through four of these units, the timer seems to only last about a year. When it goes out, one has to buy the complete unit again which means we have that much more plastic in our landfill. I'd be willing to pay full price for ONLY the timer if it was available.

However, if you think this is going to save you any work, think again. Little crusties do indeed stick to the bottom of the pan because the automatic rake doesn't touch the bottom. It has to be continually scraped to clean it. Worse is the rake itself, which gets clogged with poop and cat litter. Really look at the picture and think how you would like to clean poop from between all those tines on the rake. The rake also pushes the sand everywhere into all those open nooks and crannies. It also falls down the thin line between receptacle and the unit. For this reason I myself would recommend the tent (unless you build one yourself) even though it is overpriced.
2950	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	My rottie/lab mix puppy, little girl 4 months old, had it in pieces the first night. The stuffing was the first to come out, so I cleaned out all that and let her have the squeaky part. Bad idea. She chewed it out and literally ate the pieces of plastic. If you have a mild chewer I think it would be ok, but it is not for heavy chewers.

The two issues: 1, it's difficult to scoop. Scooping out poop ends up taking the litter with it as well, which is annoying. 2, the cats seem to track it everywhere... not sure how that happens with the pellets, but it does. Not quite so bad at tracking as clay litter, though. It also doesn't seem as dirty, although that's probably psychological.

I think for now I will stick w/ grain free brands.
And one minor added bonus: the bag is resealable. It has a ziploc, sturdy seal to it.  Minor, I know... but it's super nice so that mice and other random animals can't easily get back into it even if they happen to get into my storage area.

With the High Protein Grain Free Lamb dry food they've apparently managed to hit the high mark as far as my dog is concerned. I've been buying Nutro for years, but this food gets gobbled up quickly.

The grease runs away from the food and into a removable tray so food is healthier than food sitting in a pool of grease in a skillet or fry pan.  The non-stick surface works wonderfully so you don't have to add any grease whatsoever and clean up is so simple.  Just run it under water and wipe with a soapy dishrag or sponge.

I got tired of having to go to the store so often for canned food...we were always running out of it, it seemed!  So, Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" to the rescue!  Nothing can compare to the convenience of having a month's worth delivered to your door!  The price is great, too, especially with the 15% discount from Subscribe and Save.  The only complaint that I have is that our cats do seem to tire of the brand and these 3 flavors.  If I purchase something different from the supermarket, they seem so much more interested...I think simply because they are tired of the same old, same old.  I guess I just wish that I could order a bigger variety for the same price.

He had a smaller sized one about two years ago, and he loved it to death by sleeping on it, carrying it in his mouth, regular tooth pulling play time, and we finally had to retire the scraps of what was left (when he was not looking, of course....).  He looked for Lambchop for awhile, but he gave up. I was so discouraged that I couldn't find one ANYWHERE.  THEN, I was so pleased to see a new and BIGGER one on Amazon!!  The Price was outstanding, and my Labrador and his Lambchop are back to being cuddle buddies again.  This is a great dog toy.  I highly recommend it.

All the color wash sprays work incredibly well on a number of materials. I've used it mainly on paper, card-stock and grass-cloth and the color on those has become permanent when dry. After spraying with the color wash sprays you can spray a fine mist of water to blend the colors further. The colors are really rich but they are less intense than the matching alcohol inks.

I clean the whole box about twice a year. The bottom pan pops off. I spray it with bathroom cleaner -- Scrubbing Bubbles -- let it sit a bit and then rinse it with a garden hose. I vacumm the upper (mechanical) part of the pan and then wipe it off with a bathroom cleaning wipe.

Some cat food smells palatable (I know, I know...but really, some don't smell half bad), but this gives off a rotten odor. My cat won't go near it.

If you are looking for even a moderately healthy dog food for your furry friends, I would choose something else. ~ and no corn, please, for your best friends.  If there were a choice for no stars, I'd choose that.
2) Empty the recepticals when they are half full. This will help avoid the vile spatter and spilling. Alternatively, seal the top down before taking out the bottom section and then pull the whole thing out, empty it and then put the old set back (I definitely reuse them).

Also-also my dog loves to ask for the launcher, then when I give it to her she plays keep-away and it's adorable. The big launcher I have is harder for her to balance in her mouth, so she just lays down and chews on it until it gets taken away. She's chewed on all of the four Chuck Its we've owned, but she's only broken one (a big one), but that's because she got ahold of it when no one was home. The little one in my bag is totally chewed up but still works great. I think they're sturdier than the big ones. Except for the launcher she chewed into pieces, which was our fault, the only reason we've had to replace anything was because we lost it. Usually we keep the launcher and ball in the backpack so she can't get to them and so they don't get lost, so we rarely have to replace them. There is just not a better value in toys, and the startup price is really low.

1103	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this same Littermaid 3 years ago and it is still going strong. We have 3 littermaids, all different models for our 3 cats. I could not possible keep up with cleaning the litter and this sure helps me out a lot. We bought the permanent chute from Litterworks and my husband used an old entertainment center we got for next to nothing at goodwill and it fits 2 littermaids comfortably. If you look at littermaid disposal system at amazon[...] you will see what it sort of looks like. I love the LM9000 but I would agree the LME9000 (elite with the ionic air cleaner) does not work well and it gives littermaid a bad name. If you can find the basic ones I think they work better than the ionic air cleaner ones. We only empty our litter a couple of times a weeks as once it goes down the chute into the trash bag we only have to take the trash bag out. No, it does not smell, I also add a little baking soda to the trash bag but you do have to clean the littermaid occasionally just like any other litterbox, just not as much. I use Worlds Best Litter (corn litter) makes littermaid work easier and cuts down on the dust from litter. It is a shame that the elite's have sullied the littermaid product name. I hope they improve on it as I would like to buy a backup in case one of mine goes (I figure after 3 yrs it's due) but I won't buy another elite with the ionic (read moronic) air cleaner.

Here is the dilemma....if, you could call it that.  I clean the litter, immediately, after he goes and covers. My cat is fastidious about elimination odors.  He stays in the pan, to go.

1672	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	This blue/green ball is not easily found once lost.  I find the orange/white ball is much more easily spied in the grass or water.  It also has the advantage that it glows in the dark which is important as we have shortening days & then lose daylight savings time.  There is no compelling reason to prefer the blue/green coloring.  The orbee ball is super!!  The dogs love the squishy, chewy quality. The rope lets me throw it farther, however I don't like the tied rope. I find any loops to be dangerous for active excited dogs. When I 1st get the orbee ball I get the knot outside the ball, undo it, put a metal washer on the rope.  I then  knot the end of the rope & push the knot in 1st, followed then by the washer.  Now I cut the rope to the length I want & put a knot at the end so that I can play tug with my dog.  There are admittedly better tugging balls-specifically the rope wing-a-ding ball by Booda.

Had a few reservations thinking the ramp would have to set/install at an angle in our truck rear doorway, forcing me to place more of the top edge into the vehicle, leaving less ramp length.  Surprisingly this was not the case!  Have not yet introduced the dogs to the ramp but don't expect problems. It is wide enough for them at 17 inches and quite sturdy!  It is not the lightest of options but I am a woman and can easily lift it once the bifold spring latch is hooked up. However, won't have to worry about it flying out of the truck bed or jostling around too much.  Our 2015 RAM 2500 Crew Cab (pretty tall!) has the fold flat floor in the back.  The ramp rests securely on the ledge of the elevated floor.  Yet the ramp angle appears to be quite manageable.

Lulu the cat did enjoy it, but ate it as she tends to foods that aren't quite "it" for her. She is a little PIA with wet food. I ended up tossing out kitty dishes of the little square cutlets sucked dry of juice and gravy and not eaten at all. If you have a Picky Pants, buy a few to try before a case purchase

After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.

Your hands are free to hold a water bottle and you avoid cramping up and avoid bad posture. The leash moves from side to side on the belt part so if your dog chooses to move around you, you won't get yanked around. It's built sturdy (probably even sturdier than our regular leash) and it's a great price.

I run with my Jack Russel mix, and actually don't use the belt since it makes it too long for my little guy. I just hook the leash part around my waist to the d-ring and its a perfect length. It keeps my dog close without having to worry about stepping on or having him to far away. It's also a little springy in case he gets too far ahead, it doesn't choke him. The best part is that it's completely hands free so I can keep track of my steps too. Highly recommend!

Just want to add since canines + eating soft things can equal disaster, make sure to cut all tags, loops, etc., on dog toys.  LambChop has a neck loop we always cut off, as well as those annoying 'White Tags' on everything you buy.  We lost a sweet girl to an intestinal blockage years ago.  Pretty much freaks about what our kids swallow now, obviously.  And with any type of toy, especially soft, there's that much more reason to worry/supervise.  Don't want anyone to ever have to go through the heartache and guilt we did

We have deer ticks my dogs often get, despite my best efforts to keep them off with other stuff, so this purchase was a must. There is a small wedge groove at the bottom of the bowl and it seems to fit perfectly between the tick's suction and body parts. Removal of an adult slightly engorged was not a problem. It didn't pull off skin with it but it left no part of the tick in there either. The tick can then put directly disposed of as it fits neatly in the bowl. Genius design.

7427	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This canned dog food is a great supplement to either the Wellness dry food or to top off another brand of dry dog food.

Very happy with nutrition value and its effect on coat and overall health.

**UPDATE**  We've purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size.  I tried buying regular stuffed animals, the kind intended for kids, at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart.  We now have 2 shelties and they've been plucking at this Kong teddy bear's nose for a week (they really like that fleecy material) and this bear is holding up like a champ.
Looking at the labeling on three random flavors (Salmon, Savory Duck, Turkey & Chicken Liver), the ingredients common to all (and presumably the other varieties) are: chicken, potato starch, wheat gluten, pork plasma, natural flavors, salt, guar gum, sodium phosphate, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, DL-methionine, taurine xanthine gum, ferrous sulfate, vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc oxide, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), copper proteinate, manganous sulfate, niacin, d-calcium pantothenate, vitamin A supplement, vitamin D3 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, potassium iodide, vitamin B12 supplement, sodium selenite, folic acid, and biotin. I should try one on a cracker. (Of course, each individual flavor also contains the ingredient that defines it, like duck in the "savory duck.")

The only real downside to this dog food is that it costs a lot.  $67 for a mere 24 pounds puts it among the most expensive dog food I have ever fed to my dogs.  But, if you have a small pooch to feed, if your dog has special health demands, or if for any other reason this food suits your dog best, it's worth the price.  This is high quality stuff.

This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them. I don't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site. Besides, it's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom---a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that.

4896	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I'm a dog sitter.  I thought this would be a great idea, only the dogs are smarter than me.  They go chase the ball, then leave it.  So after I throw a dozen or so tennis balls around the yard, I have to go pick them up.  Still, it gets them running out some of their energy and it's not like I don't need the exercise.

8007	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My GSD has been on this dry food since 10 weeks old. She's gone from about 15 lbs to 75 lbs now at almost 11 months old. Her bone development has been excellent, her coat is silky smooth, teeth very clean, eyes bright and her poops are properly firm (as in easy to pick up). The dog eats about 4 big cups once a day (late evening), plus a little hamburger I give her in the early morning as a treat.  For a large breed dog, the bits are larger which prevents her from wolfing down the food, and choking on it.  Also larger pieces are good for the teeth as she must chew the pieces rather than inhaling them. Very satisfied with Hills dog food, and will transition her to the adult mix once she's about 13-14 months.
7465	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Just your regular commercial cat food.

Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.
The updated "New can design " came with certain ingredients removed. They removed potatoe, squash, zucchini and blueberries. I know this because I purchased this new version- and still had the old version in my pantry. I compared ingredients from both cans *
My dog has allergies (nasal and sometimes skin).  Her hair started thinning out a little in the back and I just figured it had to do with her skin allergies.  It very slowly kept getting worse.  I have been trying over and over to figure out if there was something that could have been causing this, I realized it started after giving the Program tablets.  I skpped the past month's tablet and hopefully her hair will grow back in.  Can't decide on a monthly to use on her, because Frontline Plus gives her hives on her belly.  I will continue to use Capstar as needed (a couple times a week or whenever she plays with the neighbor's dog or grass is long/wet and itching starts).

5585	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is a great idea for anyone with a dog who loves to fetch.  The medium size allows you to throw a standard tennis ball as well as any of the other medium balls from Chuckit.  You can throw the balls very far with little effort and without getting your hands slimy form dog drool after a long day of fetch.  You don't even have to stoop to pick up the ball.  My dogs drop their balls on command (most of the time) so I just pick it up and re-Chuckit!  It's easy to use and very fun.  I've only had it for about a week so I'm not sure how it's going to hold up, but it seems pretty sturdy.
2606	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	2.0	Our dog loves Mr. Bill and takes him everywhere, but the voice box only lasts for an hour.

Nutritionally this looks fine. We haven't seen clear health benefits in the first couple of weeks (Vine reviews have to be done within 30 days) but we expect this to be at least as good and probably better than their regular non-premium food. But satisfy yourself; look over the list of ingredients. Chicken is the most prevalent ingredient and by eye seems to be about half the contents. This is not a "cheap" dog food; it seems like a premium food but without the premium price tag.

755	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my needs. I only like to use monthly view calendars with squares big enough to write a few notes on the days. I always have a hard time finding a simple, no frills calendar book with just monthly views without the daily or weekly calendar included. Most are "pocketbook" size and I find them to be too small. Love the extra note pages, the elastic to band the book closed, and the little pocket in the back cover. Unlike another reviewer mentioned, the dates in my calendar are all correct.  A great product!
4267	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Cannot say enough how great this ball is for our dog. He loves to fetch it and then have a good chew on it, before returning to us.
3778	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I was using small plastic bags off a roll I bought at the local pet store for picking up after my dog. They were flimsy and not very easy to use. Then when walking my dog at the local metro park I discovered mutt mitts. My town provides them for clean up in the parks. There are sturdy, easy to use and biodegradable. I initially ordered 400 and in the last year have used most of them. I recently ordered another 200. The construction of the mitt is great... a plastic mitt that goes a little more than midway (on me) to the elbow and has a double layer of plastic on the pick up end. You simply put it on like a large mitten grab the dog "residue" and fold the sleeve inside out and using the long sleeve tied into a knot seal the bag. I keep a garbage can at the end of the driveway to keep the mitts in until pickup day. Much better and easier to use than the usual flimsy bags from the pet store... highly recommended.
6186	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Very easy to use and you don't have to worry about not getting the entire tick out.  Far better than tweezers.

It was the clear winner of an extensive grain-free taste test that included Weruva, Spot's Stew, Blue Buffalo, and others I forget. My only complaint is many of the cans had dents.

3470	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I need to preface this review by saying that I have been using these bags for years, probably since they first were sold.  I thought they were great and would spend the extra money on them.  They were thick, strong and better than any other bag I have tried.  I think I have used them since the days of the Pooper Scooper and that was a long time ago.  I recommended them highly to anyone who had a dog.  Now, the last batch I got had some printing on it that I have never seen before.  The bags have become paper thin and tear while using them.  That is the last thing you want when you are picking up poop.  I didn't mind paying more money for a quality product but I will not buy these again until I hear that the quality has returned to what it has been for the past 15 years or so.  This is awful!!
With one cat it may not be worth the financial investment to have an auto poopy-scooper ($100-150 US). It has added an hour to my life every day -- plus added to my cats' health and well-being so it was well worth it for me.

10	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	This is the biggest waste of money - do not buy it - it will not work!


I clean the whole box about twice a year. The bottom pan pops off. I spray it with bathroom cleaner -- Scrubbing Bubbles -- let it sit a bit and then rinse it with a garden hose. I vacumm the upper (mechanical) part of the pan and wipe it down good with a bathroom cleaning wipe. (The rake will unscrew from the motorized arm and I could soak it in a bucket of Clorox water - but this is a litter box and I am not that fastidious.) All this takes about 20 minutes. Make sure all the parts are bone dry before reloading with new litter.

1320	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This product is by far the best ear cleanser; better than the prescription one as well. Max has chronic ear problems secondary to having atopic dermatitis. Ark cleanser is gentle yet very effective ; I use a bit of vinegar diluted with water regularly as well but then use the ark cleanser; it soothes his ear immediately and leaves a scent of cinnamon .  Poor Max his ears get so inflamed that it even takes the prescription meds 3 days to get the swelling to go down ; so this ark cleanser working on day one has totally amazed me.  It must make Max feel the difference as well because no more struggling with him to be still he actually leans towards me when I use this product. Super thank you please don't stop making Ark ear cleanser. and its all natural ; just doesn't get any better than that.

The price is very good on Amazon too.

Bella is too small to be able to hold a regular sized tennis ball properly in her mouth (she has to pick it up by the "fuzz") but these 2 inch balls are a perfect size for her.

Of course, the charging rate on this one is as fast as a wall charger for my Galaxy Note 3 phone. The rate does not diminish when I plug in two tablets. To be honest I have never bothered to benchmark the charging rates of the tablets, but the Note 3 and its 3300mAh battery charges at 1% per 2.5 minutes, which is the maximum charging rate for that device.
4547	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	This launcher didn't work as well as the 25m launcher. Probably handler area but the 25m launcher worked much better for me.
3183	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog would always vomit on car rides but not anymore! These wafers really do work. You need to feed it to your dog at least 30 minutes before your car ride since they do need a chance to get into their system.

However, they do not make him slow or drowsey which is fantastic because I still want him to feel like himself and be able to play and run around. I love this product!!!

I use this ramp with a hatchback and for storage am able to stand it on its side against the door using a bungy cord to keep it upright.  This saves a lot of room and allows me to carry 3 large dogs in my hatchback with rear seats folded. I previously tried putting it behind front seat but it was awkward to get in and out with back seats folded down.
1205	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	I got more flicked in my face in 1 month then in 15 years in the veterinary business.
4573	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I love this launcher (14S) because it is the perfect size to throw the smaller balls for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  She loves it because it can throw farther than I can with my arm, so it is more challenging for her, and she gets more exercise.  Best reason to have this launcher is definitely so I don't have to touch the dirty and slimy ball she brings back! LOL!

4699	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I suffered from frozen shoulder and my dogs were getting super annoyed at how weak my throwing abilities had become.  I swear I even saw them roll their eyes at me when the tennis ball landed five feet from me.  The Chuckit Launcher solves that problem, because with minimal effort, you can get a tennis ball to sail across a field.  It's also great in that you never actually have to touch a slobberly ball, but can pick it up and throw it without ever having to touch it.

I am buying a second one so that hopefully we have less drama in the family.
543	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I should have paid closer attention to the description because these are a lot bigger than I thought they were going to be.

This new recipe has something wrong with it
Which one looks healthier to you?  Here's a hint -- healthy cats do not need whole wheat, which is just an unnecessary (and cheap) carbohydrate filler, and gluten is not a good form of protein for cats and can actually cause digestive upset.  Powdered cellulose is added for fiber but is usually made from pine trees in cat food and is not healthy for cats in large quantities.  Now read the ingredients lists again.  Science Diet is about making profits with cheap ingredients, NOT making healthy cat food -- I gave it 2 stars only because at least it's made in the USA.  In fact, the excessive amount of wheat in Science Diet can actually prevent a cat from absorbing the actual nutrients in the food.  Solid Gold, on the other hand, is a holistic food that is wheat and gluten free and includes probiotics, which Science Diet does not.  They also have been around for over 40 years so must be doing something right.  After switching to Solid Gold my cats' fur went from dull and dry to shiny and soft, which to me is a good indication of overall better health and nutrition.  By the way, I've tried three different Solid Gold flavors with our guys and they absolutely LOVE them all.  I actually use the lower calorie version as a healthy "treat" for our cats and they devour it, and even a small bag is MUCH cheaper per pound than buying "special" treats that are often much less healthy.  Win win!

This bear came with a free replacement squeaker, which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker, for extra squeaking fun.  Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives, both squeakers have survived my little girl's needle sharp teeth.  The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk, without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out.  I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war, but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys.  For 5 months, this bear looked perfect, other than the slobber on it.  Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest, which all happened in the last month, but we still use it because there's no stuffing in the bear.  I'm currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement, when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.
1733	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This is the second Lambchop toy I've bought for my Maltese. She destroyed her first one. (Not that it is flimsy; she just played with it so much that she killed it.) Gave her this for Christmas and she was running around with it before the paper was all the way off. I don't know what it is about this thing that she likes so much... Its feet have little squeakers and there's one in its main body as well. The squeak isn't obnoxiously loud, as some toys are. (I think the really loud squeaky toys scare her.) It's almost as big as she is... maybe she sees it as another puppy. Who knows. It's very soft and squishy, which I also think she prefers over some more "durable" (like Kong brand) toys.

This apron is perfect for covering up and protecting my outfit and still looking cute at the same time. When I first ordered this, I mistakenly thought it was a set of 4 aprons. Had I read the description in detail, I would've seen that it's actually a set of 1 apron, 1 napkin, 1 kitchen towel, and 1 hot pad, all matching. They are made out of sturdy cotton, so they are all very easily machine washable. I would definitely recommend this set to all home cooks. It's cute, practical, and unisex too. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope this was helpful to you!

We actually saw other people using them at the dog park and she would always chase them around until they played with the ChuckIt with her, so I had to buy her one. Amazon offers this for  half the price that pet stores do, so it's a great value. The launcher sends the ball pretty far, and picks up balls easily so you don't have to touch them. I'm  thinking of buying a few more to have on hand.

So small breeds shouldn't be given tough Nylabone toys like this Dinosaur model.  If you watch any dog chew on this particular toy, you will quickly notice how small his/her teeth are in relation to the toy, and you will probably be surprised by the leverage and power he/she puts into each bite.  They gnaw, they gnash, they continue to work at it until those tiny teeth lose the battle against the tough Nylabone.  Comparing this to human teeth, everyone knows someone who fractures/cracks a tooth somehow.  That's because our front "chicklet" teeth bite down on something hard, get broken from falling on your face, getting hit in the mouth, having teeth weakened by cavities, and from not seeing a dentist/hygienist on a regular basis--usually because we're afraid of a little pain.
1653	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	The Flexi Brand Leashes are nice looking, comfortable to hold and easy to control. Our dog can smoothly move in front of and around us and the leash extends and retracts smoothly. My hands are a little weak from injuries, and I found the Flexi Giant Leash (26 foot) to be so heavy I could not comfortably use it. I use the Flexi Comfort 3 Leash (Large, not XL) which is shorter but considerably lighter.  However, the large may not meet the needs of a very large dog or one that needs "distance" on the leash.  This line of leashes can't be beaten!  Just be sure when you purchase the XL that you are aware it is very heavy and large.

Having said that, I have always had Great Danes with very short hair, but I recently got a Goldendoodle with very thick, curly, fur like a sheep.  I put the collar on him and it has killed MOST of the fleas.  He still has 6 or 8 a day that cluster right around his groin (which is far away from the collar).  I BELIEVE it is because the collar is not touching his neck because his fur is so thick.  Therefore 4 stars instead of 5.  I am contemplating shaving a channel in the hair on his neck so the collar will fit better, but that will look weird...

Our lab mix is less that 2 years old and still a serious chewer. This toy did not survive her love. She has been able to destroy it.

You could use a plastic carrier as transport, and I'm sure someone out there reading this is wondering that exact thing, but hellcats take even less kindly to carriers with barred doors that invite inquisitive dogs at the vet's office to inspect their mobile prison.  Hellcat wants to travel as inconspicuously as possible, and the multiple flaps act as iron curtains between their burning resentment and the world at large.  Strips of industrial-strength mesh near the top of the carrier let in plenty of oxygen, keeping hellcat's mind sharp and fresh...as sharp as the claws that will soon be shredding your tender flesh, and fresh as the blood that will soon be pouring from your wounds.

Quite the opposite, my eldest went crazy playing with this right out of the box, youngest not so much. I've had it for 3 days and watching him bat the ball with both paws is a joy! I just purchased the smaller, 2 ball toy, hoping for some interaction for both boys. Oh, my boys aren't small, 12 & 10 pounds, and this hasn't moved on the rug or tipped over.

I think the only bad thing about these is that they are biscuits, which of course get very dry, so our dog can only have one or two before he gets tired of them. He also tends to not drink until he's dying of thirst, so that just may be a personal problem of his, ha ha.

Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys.

9816	Pet_Supplies_5	NEG	1.0	Cat has a great time plucking the ball out and slamming it aroud the master bath, apparently tile floor makes the most satisfying crash-bang destruction noise. At 4am. When this bear is trying to sleep. Im pretty sure Cat is trying to sail this ball through the showed door, a window, the mirror, or all of the above. I kinda hate this product.

8053	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	4.0	My 25lb Boston Terrier is an aggressive chewer who is a pro at destroying toys. On my quest to find toys that he loves and that can hold up to his playing, I've tried several Nylabone products and they work very well. I ordered one of these dino chews and got the stegosaurus, which my pup immediately began playing with. After a few days I noticed that the ends of the dino were getting pretty sharp, so I took a file and smoothed some of the sharpness and I've done this a couple times as he whittles the ends down. He loves this toy, and I do supervise him more heavily with this one because it is such a hard plastic and has an unusual shape, although he hasn't chewed any chunks of it off but he probably could if I didn't "fix" the ends for him. I think I may order another in hopes of getting the t-rex or brontosaurus, because those ones look like they would not get the sharp ends that the one I received does. That's really my only complaint about this toy, and so far my dog has no complaints.
6641	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	The bubles aren't like soap bubbles, in that it takes a lot, hit or miss, if it makes bubbles, a bit frustrating to get it to work consistently, but it's safe for cats, my cats adore the bubbles, they chomp at them (do not add soap to make it work, it's edible), and I love the concept- for what it's worth I may be doing it wrong lol blowing too hard etc... wonderful thing this is...

1335	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	First, the noise level is low.  Nothing that's going to drive humans crazy.  Second, the Wiggly Giggly Ball is everything it promises to be.  Tough, makes low-level noise, and requires no batteries.  Love that.  Though my current dog didn't go bonkers over this ball, I've had dogs who loved batting them about.  My dog is into noisy toys but not balls so much.  But I'd still recommend the Wiggly Giggly Ball for its quality and durability.

3490	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	I love these bags...they cost a bit more, but for me are well worth the price.  I like that they are not overly thin, and I don't feel like my hand is in the poop, when I use these bags.  I have never had a bag to tear, have a hole or rip at an inopportune time. I truly like that they are biodegradable.  Their expiration date is generally one year, so I can only stock up so many at a time, but that's OK.
I dump litter once or twice a day into a waste basket with liner.
2349	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Oh no!! Mr. Bill! Bought this as a chew toy for our dog, liked it so much I ended up hanging it on my bar instead. Great for old friends who remember Mr. Bill from SNL. I'm guessing the dog would have liked it but he didn't get a chance to tear it up.
3265	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	So far it seems to be working.  My cat is strictly indoors, so I only had to give him a few doses over a couple months to get rid of what he had.  Since then he has been happy and healthy all the way around.
Well I'm watching tv while he's gnawing away when he comes running over frantically to me and lays down. I figure he's scared of something. I investigate and only see his t-Rex sitting there on his blanket. I come back over and he's spitting something up.  It's his teeth. He's spitting out pieces of his teeth that had broken on that toy. My question is, who would make a toy so hard that it can break teeth?
4315	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for my energetic pups and sometimes they have trouble with "drop it" but they get really excited when I pull this out to play outdoors.

Good luck

This planner works well for me.  Each month is spread across two pages with enough room on each individual date to add more than one notation. The advantage to this is being able to see the entire month at once, a feature that helps me prioritize my work.  The size of the spaces allows me to write in personal appointments, kids' practices and game, and other reminders. Tabs along the side let you quickly turn to a specific month as needed.

9237	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	My dog loves these and he's very picky about treats and food!  He developed food allergies recently. He might be allergic to peas and it's very hard to find treats and dog food without peas.  I also buy grain-free food and treats. This doesn't have any peas or grains in it and has limited natural ingredients.  They're big enough to give him one after his meal.  Also, it's a larger bag, so I don't have to buy that often. The price is great!

(But the manufacturer does include some tips on how to train your dog to use it.) It's easy to fold, but may weigh more than some are used to lifting. It also has a spring-lock securing tab when it's stored. Easy clean-up too. Only drawback is you need some depth to use this. I have to pull my vehicle 3 feet out of our shallow garage, set up the ramp, then load in all 3 dogs.

My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully.  But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.
At it was a big fat THUD. Charlie hated them, I didn't know how to make them work they way they were supposed to work and thought I had wasted my money. But after a week, when I finally started to get the hang of it. The wheelie ball was a hoot. Charlie had never chased anything the like that before and he was totally thrown by it. The erratic ball and the evader started to make sense to him and he started enjoying them as well.

6433	Pet_Supplies_5	POS	5.0	This has been the absolute favorite toy of every single cat we have ever owned.  Sprinkle a little catnip on the scratching pad and they go crazy!  They love doing back flips while chasing the ball.  This turbo scratcher is also incredibly durable and you'll literally never need to replace it.  We have had ours for almost 18 years!  If you have cats, this is definitely a must have!
