6742	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I have used a Morley ABY switch to route 2 guitars to 1 amp for about 20 years. For that application they are hard to beat. Quiet, transparent, built to last, and reasonably priced. I just got one for my wife (bass player) to switch between 2 basses (alternate tuning) and she has been quite pleased with it. For our use only one button (A or B) gets used. Stepping on the wrong button (A and B) may cause feedback, but you learn quickly which button to use. I have never used the Morley ABY switch to switch one guitar between 2 amps so I can't speak to that.

The only negative thing about this capo is: I have very sweaty hands and when it's hot (as it usually is on my country) this is a little slippery to get on/off the guitar neck. If it had some rubber even on one of the sides where you apply pressure to attach/release it would help me. But that's just for my specific caso and I can probably do it myself with some superglue and a small rubber strip.

Some Of The Patterns A + B Can Be  Combined Together With a Foot Pedal When You Are Playing The Same Song.

The bottom line, with both thumbs highly up, I absolutely recommend this fine cartridge. Period. Especially for a novice to the vinyl world or someone on a budget. I have found it difficult to listen to cd's or any digital musical format since owning this cartridge. In fact, I get bored with cd playback nowadays. There's just no musical "involvement".Don't be fooled by the simple black and lavender/purple? colored simple looking cartridge. It's what's on the inside of the body that really counts ! The AT 440ML possesses that bang for the buck quality that is hard to beat and will revitalize your long yearning for super (not perfect) audiophile listening and extract nuances and other fine qualities from your record collection !

I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...

6229	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	One of the best things I did for my acoustic guitar tone was finding the right pick.
Pickups:  The pickups were a little high, which caused the guitar to sound harsh and muddy.  After adjustment to Gibson factory specs it was much better.  The pickups seem very "hot", so you may want to lower them below Gibson specs.
I believe this to be the best sounding drum machine made today for the price, it is fairly simple to program, has the most real sounding drums has a nice fill feature... it realy looks cool and has large pads...it doenst save very well, seems once saved, the original is there forever... but still one can create patterns you can save in in cubase, magix or samplitude or another recording program once youve done your program to be sure except for future tempo changees could be off and funny sounding...

7394	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This microphone sounds great... once you have the preamp to go along with it. The descriptions for the 520DX make it sound like you can plug directly into an amp, but I don't recommend this at all. If you do so you will get tons of feedback and a really tinny sound. However if you add a microphone preamp between this mic and the amp, you will get the sound you're looking for.

136	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I got this guitar 2003 and seven years later it still has an amazing sound. This guitar has a strong neck and keeps its tune for a long time. Many people have played this guitar and just love how it sounds. This guitars quality is as good as any classical guitar, the price is a good deal. You won't regret buying this guitar. I use Augustine classical guitar strings, I also use Pro Arte (Normal Tension EJ45C) classical guitar strings which sound really good (highly recommended). For those who are first time guitar buyers...NEVER put steel strings on a classical guitar because the neck is not strong enough and it will bend or snap. Classical guitar strings are nylon. Keep guitar away from extreme heat. This guitar looks nice and has a gloss finish. The neck is not too big or too small, it's just right. Handling is good and has a white mark indicating the 7th fret where you can easily see it.

These are a slippery pick, as many reviewers have mentioned. What I have been doing for years is slightly texture the grip area with a wood burner or use a razor blade to cut a slight checkerboard pattern. This improves the grip greatly and resolves any slipping issues.

These are thinner and feel softer than the nylon Aquila strings that many people like. I think the Martin fluorocarbon strings give me more detail and just as much volume as the Aquilas. The Martin strings also break in faster. In less than a week, I only have to tune them once a day (compared to 3 weeks to break in Aquilas). Martins are also cheaper than Aquilas.

2380	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58.  I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and "clean" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).
7638	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great tool! Gives a great feel and very well made
The last glaring question (probably one of the most important) is whether or not this is an excellent tracker (and this is a two-fold question or concern). Are words beginning with s, t, p, and f accurately reproduced (sibilance)? Yes and no. That honorary distinction would be for the Shure V15VxMR cartridge (which is now out of production and was the last of a dying audiophile cartridge breed to be had for a reasonable price range). With the AT 440ML it's more hit than miss with sibilants. About 85% to 90% of the time "spitty" consonants are pronounced accurately with a slight edge or exaggeration. However, there have been a few of my clean records where the letter "s" cuts through with that static-like harshness more than once on any given side. One such record I have that proves this theory and shortcoming of this cartridge is  Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive swing jazz album (the letter s is tracked harshly with that annoying edgy sound). As for overall tracking quality of the music signal in general from beginning of groove to end, it has that inner groove distortion problem licked (this is where the AT 440ML shows off it's greatest audiophile strength). This is due to the linear contact stylus. Nothing MORE aggravating to a record listener than when a low budget or poorly produced cartridge, while it may sound clear and great in the first few tracks on a record side, but then as the needle goes towards the center, the last tracks suffer horribly (no matter how much anti-skate force you apply)! You will no longer have this problem with the AT 440ML; you will finally find out what you have been missing.
Today the SR-16 can still be found in many professional and home recording studios. With the emergence of Pro Tools and other PC based Digital Audio Workstations, stand alone rhythm machines have become much less popular today in pro recording, but they are still very popular in home studios and for performing solo musicians around the world.

I also have an Ibanez RG and a Squier Fat Strat, and the SG compares well, although these 3 guitars have very different sounds.
This clamps very tightly to my mike stand - I have adjusted it, bumped into it, etc. and it is still in place.  It seems to work and cost very little - particularly when you look at prices on anything to do with a studio....  Recommended
Cons
The headband wraps around behind the head and slips over the ears. Like a pair of glasses, you can become so accustomed to the headband that you almost forget you're wearing it. The four-foot long thin cable routes out of the way behind the wearer's back and terminates in an XLR connector that clips to a pocket or belt, providing a disconnect point. The WH20XLR comes with a pair of windscreens and an additional cable routing clip.

It handles well and feels good in the hand, very natural. I've used other capos including ones with screws and slides and parts and... yuck. This is a single piece capo that simply works.
6041	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a fun banjo/guitar.  It plays nicely.  Projects nicely too.  You can modify it with a pickup with relative ease.  I play guitar and had no interest in learning a new fingering technique for a banjo.  You can play it like a regular guitar, but it projects loudly enough that you can play it just by rubbing your fingers against the strings to get a sound.  It's a nice breather when I'm burnt out on guitar.  It's a different sound.  It's comforting and relaxing.

The fit and finish on my guitar was absolutely flawless, as good as my multi-thousand dollar guitars!  The double cream binding on the body looks great.  The frets could probably do with a little bit of polishing/reshaping or I may just simply play the guitar until they wear in a little bit.  This is common for guitars that come from the factory.  Speaking of the factory, mine is made in Indonesia and the guitar comes with a "set up in the USA" label and checklist that is hand-checked and signed.  One thing you must do when you get the guitar brand new is to tighten the truss rod as it will have been loosened for shipping.  Mine was completely loose when it arrived and there was a very slight bow in the neck as a result that was easily fixed by tightening the rod until it was no longer completely loose but not too tight either.  I also lowered the bridge slightly from the factory setting.

First heard of using medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings after looking up that Elliott Smith used them on an old, cheap Yamaha guitar. I couldn't believe it. His strings had such an incredibly bassy, warm tone to them that I assumed it had more to do with mic quality or placement, but no, amazingly, it really is just the strings.
The cable itself is a little stiff....not as supple as many other cables, but that's not a major problem.  Once you figure out the button; 'In = On' and 'Out = Off', it is very convenient.

4043	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I've had my wah pedal for a number of years now. What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use, no problem with the pedal itself, mechanically. However, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. Also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP. Other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of Dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal. A classic that will surely live on.

7489	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Sounds great but I had an issue where my batteries corroded and left the thing inoperable.

8034	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	This is not a very good harmonica. It leaks too much air, making it hard to play, particularly on the draw notes. It's playable, but it's far more work than it should be, and it's difficult to make the notes sound at something approximating equal loudness when some of them want to come out as more of a wheeze than a clear tone. To be fair, the Blues Harp doesn't leak as much as some Chinese harmonicas, such as the Hohner Blues Bands (which leak like screen doors). But other (non-Chinese) harmonicas manage to leak far less - my Seydel Blues Session and Suzuki Promaster leak only slightly, my Lee Oskar doesn't leak at all. Even other German-made Hohners such as the Special 20 leak far less than the Blues Harp.

Pretty teal green color.
With the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out.

It's not entirely the easiest to put on when you have lots of hair, but it's manageable. It's also not all that comfortable either.

Don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect.
Also, fit and finish is excellent - AKG have obviously kept QC standards up despite having these made now in China.  Connections are first-rate, and the cable enters at the Left earcup as the good Lord intended.  I love the compactness and fit of the screw-on 1/4" plug (an adaptor that fits over the 1/8" - 3.5mm - plug).

Unless you're one of those types who regularly abuses your equipment, the mK is built solid enough for stage use, but then again, I'm also the type that tends to baby my gear. Right out of the box, the faux wood side-panels felt a tad loose, which made it feel a little flimsy, but after a few turns with the screwdriver, they were nice and tight and it definitely felt more solid. I've also noticed that a lot of people seem to complain about the keys, either their size or feel. I do admit that they do take a little getting used to, but unless you're recreating Flight of the Bumblebee, you should be able to manage just fine, even with stubby little sausage fingers. Naturally, if worse comes to worse, you can always connect a full size MIDI controller and use the mK as a stand-alone sound module. As far as running via battery power, the concept is pretty cool, but be warned, they do drain pretty quickly and will give you a little over an hour of playing and tweaking. I've never been the type to rely on battery power, especially for outboard gear or effect pedals, so I would suggest sticking with the wall-wart. Lastly, don't be fooled by the bank names on the Program Select panel because they really don't do any justice for the mK. I'm sure "Trance", "Techno/House", "Electronica", etc. were used for marketing purposes by satisfying the instant gratification factor for that out-of-box experience.

I think a new set of strings will improve the performance immensely.  The stock strings sound ok but they seem to be very course wound and are pretty noisy when you move your fingers on them.  I may put a set of flats on it.  The neck has a minor little cosmetic nick or two in the wood, but they have no effect on its playing and are basically invisible unless your are inspecting it very closely from inches away.  The guitar is a nice weight and the neck unexpectedly thin, which is nice if you have smaller hands as I do. It is a very attractive instrument overall and plays very nicely.
I recommend dunlop.
Value:  Unbeatable.  This is not just good guitar for the money, it's a good guitar period.

Hum? Forget about it. Cell phone static? Thing o' the past. CB radio interference? Tunes it right out. The secret is twisted pair construction, which eats up an extra inch or so of wire per foot of finished cable. The signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise. Cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration.  It saves wire and keeps the price down but the cable acts as an antenna and attracts all kinds of electromagnetic junk from the air.

Aside from popularity, the Marine Band has a distinctive Pearwood Comb and produces luscious melodies. It is a 10 hole diatonic harmonica. Again, since 1896, this is a tried and true instrument played the world over . So I always will be inclined to pay extra money for a Hohner harmonica.

Speaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.

Comfort: 2 out of 5. I have a small head (adult small/x-small) and these feel too tight, after about 20 minutes using I have to take them off to relieve the pressure.  Even with them being tight, I plugged them into my amp and began to jam on my guitar and any movement more than a simple head nod made the headband flip on top of my face.  The only thing I like about these are that it has the cord coming from one side vice both.
After awhile it becomes easier to not mess up the intonation, and there are very few times when I'm performing that I have to do anything fancy with a guitar capo, which really only leaves the pros. I'd say it's important though to have a few capos on hand for the different uses, but this is one that should be at close reach. Given its looks and ease to maneuver I highly recommend it for performance settings assuming it fits your guitar.
It's easy to put on and take off. It kind of feels like putting a big binder clip on a stack of papers. The only thing to get used to is chording right up against it, which feels a little odd since the size is bigger than your normal low-profile nut.

I'm going to try these Martins and compare.
Wanted to try thicker picks ever since watching a bunch of youtube tutorial videos from Rob Chapman (aka "The Monkey Lord" aka "Chappers") and remembering that he recommended thick guitar picks for people who 'shred' because the thicker pick necessitated a looser grip which allows for quicker and more fluid playing (unrelated aside - two of my cooking mentors recommend having a very loose grip on knives for quicker and more accurate cutting).

7246	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I bought a set of D'Addario Helicore Cello Strings for a recently purchased second cello (which was used).  The cello, from a reputable company, came with terrible sounding strings which needed immediate replacements.  Since I wanted to compare my two cellos by equalizing the strings and using the same bow, it made sense to order Helicore strings (FYI my primary cello came with the Helicore).  As stated in other reviews for this product, the strings made a huge improvement in tone and projection on my second cello.  The "o.k." cello became a decent one simply by changing the strings.  I was amazed to find that the Helicore strings made that much difference.  Now, I'm really sold on the Helicore strings.  I believe it's worth spending $100 on this set.  I highly recommend it.
3180	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is a fantastic stand. These are made really well, and are solid. They break down easily and efficiently. STRATOCASTER owners: this stand does not work well with the Fender Strat, because the output (TS) jack on the guitar lines up with one of the support arms on the stand, (I do NOT recommend this stand for Stratocasters). My other guitars, where the output jack is on the edge of the body of the guitar fit on the stand perfectly, with clearance for the lead cable.
I haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.
Yes, I've tried the cheaper ones.  Don't do it.

The only downside is that you have to go old-school with the programming; the SR-16 is menu-based rather than "GUI"-based.

First, a fairly large bump on the top of the case; something stuck on the case's shell which was covered by the outer skin.  Admittedly, it's going to get scuffed up and a bump isn't going to matter, but new out of the box, it wasn't what I wanted to see. A second issue relates to the latches; three of the four have a good firm latch, but the fourth is almost too loose to close properly - this is without a guitar inside the case.
So with all of that, I have to give these a big ol' 5 out of 5 stars.  I've used Boomers for a good many years now...they are part of "my sound" and they have always come thru for me!  Ya really can't ask for much more than that.

The instrument is obviously a "starter" uke. It's light and the finish isn't beautiful, but it doesn't look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on.

I'm often working with kids and leading services at my temple with my guitar, and it's great to be able to place it with one hand and not disrupt the flow of what I'm doing. No one notices or cares if I'm thrown slightly out of tune. If I'm playing a coffeehouse, everyone is doing their patter while tuning between every song anyway. I have used some of the other capos mentioned in that situation.
Well that's enough for now, I have some strings to change and some jamming to take care of.
I tried to use my own screws from my tool box but it just didn't work.
As a side note, while I dearly love this cymbal, my absolute favorite ride is the 19" Zildjian Armand Signature Ride (ASIN B0002GFNF4).  If you are considering this cymbal give the Armand Signature a look (and play) first before making a final decision.

However, I felt like my ukuleles weren't playing the sounds that I want or sound the way I thought they'd sound (except my Kala soprano with solid spruce top, that thing is bright as duck)I also felt that they weren't really good with finger picking or classical solos - the nylgut-esque material of the Aquila kind of sticks to your hands, or is easy to get caught in your fingernails if you are a fingernail picker (like a classical guitarist, which I am not because I dislike long grey nasty fingernails, no offense). Still, I blamed the fault to my lack of skills and perhaps improper ukulele setup, because, well, Aquila is like ukulele string god.

The price for this should be $299 max due to the finish. I guess we are so used to Apple products and the perfection of those that everything else looks cheap if not made to the ultimate standards.
This case is the 940-EDREAD & fits the AJ-100 & /CE like a glove. As perfect as any case made for a specific guitar. Mine is exactly like the picture. Black leather like vinyl brown handle & the lid edge is trimmed in brown & a thin brown trim piece 1" from the bottom. It's heavy(wood), extremely sturdy(exactly like Les Paul cases) & with 5 gold clasps could very well be air an tight seal. Inside is soft plush material & perfect grade foam, exactly what you expect from Epiphone. It's much like the Gibson Les Paul case I had. One locking clasp that comes with one key(don't lose it).

4238	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	My original bass had a humbucker and boy have I missed that tone.  All the Jazz, precision and P/J bass' I've played just haven't filled that void.  I play mostly classic rock and blues covers which is where this bass excels.  It has amazing tone and growl to die for.  I bought mine used and it was set up and ready to go by the time it got to me (just needed a new set of strings).  With a set of DiAddario semi flats and a KB200 amp I got a tone I'm not going to try to replace for a long time.  It wasn't a purchase I rushed into I tried other Epiphones (EB series [what can say I say, I'm attracted to the Humbucker]), Squire's, Ibanez (gsr, sr), ESP, and even a Danelectro.  None, NONE of those came close to the tone I got from the Thunderbird (of course I may be bias as it does play into the genre I prefer).  Any Bass that had a better sound was easily twice the price ($600+).  The body is killer, and as far as I can tell indestructible (You can search reviews online and find testimony to this).  Watch out for the neck dive though, I didn't think it would bother me at first, but after holding through practice for a couple hours it gets tiring. The neck is pretty chunky, it's not what I would call "fast". 4 stars is appropriate for this bass, It's good but needs a few modifications to be great.
I'd highly recommend this product.

1286	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	For the price, you really can't go wrong. These are the same types of cables you can buy at Guitar Center but are half the price here on Amazon. Anytime I go to Guitar Center, I ALWAYS check the Amazon price first, not only to make sure I'm getting a good deal, but also to check the reviews. These cables are keepers!
Besides the tone, the heavier gauge also allows for a few perks while playing. For one, they're so thick that you sort of have to try to knock them out of tune, and they endure the general wear-and-tear of constant playing far better than lighter-gauge strings. Secondly, as with any heavier gauge, they resonate more, and that translates into sheer volume. If you slammed your pick down on strings like these in an apartment, there is absolutely no doubt that all of your neighbors would hear you loudly and clearly. Of course, this also means that you can fingerpick without using your nails and still get a very pleasant, subdued, medium-volume tone. Honestly, light-gauge steel strings sound almost tinny to me by comparison.

8074	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	=) They do what they're supposed to do!
Having said that, this is a good sounding microphone that will give you years of ultra-reliable use.  I recommend it for all project studios.
I don't expect either to last forever at such a low price. The value on both cords is exceptional. The good news is, with XLR, as long as you're getting a connection the quality of the cable doesn't have much (any) impact on the quality of the sound. The design of an XLR cord is such that quality is maintained.
A good choice of pedal is the Boss FS6 which is switchable from latching to momentary. Along with a 1/4 TRS and 1/4 TRS to mono splitter I'm finally in business AND a little neater.

1537	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've dealt with my share of low quality cables and this cable was so inexpensive I was hesitant to purchase it for that reason alone. I am pleased to say that it is a solid piece of equipment.  No buzz whatsoever and it appears and feels to be of very sturdy construction.  Only time will tell if the cable will magically flake out at some point but for the moment I am glad I purchased it and may buy more in the future. My recommendation is to purchase this cable, if it holds up to usual wear and tear it is as good as any cable 3 - 4x it's price.
The round circular thumb indentations help with grip but they would provide better grip if they were polished like the rest of the pick, rather than textured. But still, this pick has a comfortable 3-dimensional shape. The edge profile is beveled a bit like a knife edge - this reduces the tendency of a thicker pick like this to 'dig in' to the strings during up-strokes.
Sounds great, richer, and NOT scratchy like the Red Label.

As a result, if you flip these picks, the feel changes completely.

The tubes definitely can add some overdrive...Im just not sure if its the best sounding.  A good tube amp should give you this already, at least for guitar.  It seems Bass players are higher raters of this pedal than guitarists.  It is a bit tricky to find the best sound as there are so many variables.  It does seem to add some warmth to my hybrid amp (tube pre, trans. power).  It has not driven my MXR Super Comp out of my chain though, and is not the miraculous tone maker that some seem to describe...almost like its alchemy!  Seems reviews are over the top bad or good as they are written after first impression.  This pedal does little to affect your sound...which can be a good thing with compression.  I would like to try the Carl Martin I have heard so much about.  Seems the Keeley is rated high for the squash of Nashville.
I'm not saying these are perfect, but they are as close as I'll get, since I certainly won't spend more than a c-note on headphones - it just wouldn't be prudent.  I pushed my own limits to get these at just less than seventy bucks, and I'm darned glad that I did.  My opinion then is obvious - best at the price, and better than many to which I've listened in the past that were much more expensive.
7397	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I used a Spectraflex cable for years in the 90's when I was constantly gigging, and somewhere I either lost it or gave it away, because it never failed me.

1453	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Works well. Played several gigs with it. Seems to be pretty reliable comparing to other units on amazon.
CON:
The only downside to the Beta is the cost and that it might actually be a better mic than what you need.

5286	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	The cable itself is great. There are plenty of reviews here to back that up. The issue that I have been having is that sometimes the off setting works a little too well. In my personal experience, I haven't been plugging into a hot amp or sound system as much as I thought I would be (I still tend to plug in before the power is on, or to be sure the line is muted). More often what has happened is that during a hurried sound check the issue with sending out no signal was simply due to the cable's circuit breaker switch not being turned on. The same thing has happened when others have borrowed my cable and weren't even aware of the on/off function.
2129	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	It's a N44-7. Not much to review for it, works great with serato!
String Action:  The strings were a full 1/8" upon arrival, the truss rod adjustment got it down to 3/32", and I had to lower the bridge to 1/16".  Once at the proper height, there was no string buzz at any point on the neck.

5566	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I like it so far and it does what it is meant to do. It clamps on to my mic stand and doesnt seems to slip around and move or anything. One thing that I like that I didn't realize on amazon is that it actually has two screens, one on each side of the plastic circle. The only thing that I have found so far that I don't like is that you have to really work to be able to find a position that the flex arm will hold it at the right spot for. It seems flimsy and droopy in some spots. thats a minor inconvenience. Really it keeps the spit out of your microphone which is what is it meant to do.

Comparing the SR-16 to newer products: Rhythm machines produced by Roland/BOSS, Yamaha and ZOOM are the SR-16's primary competition, with Roland and Alesis often cited as leaders and innovators in pro electronic percussion (these companies also produce the best quality electronic kits and the same samples are used in their rhythm machine products). Some of the features common to newer rhythm machines not found on the SR-16 include: 24-bit samples, more memory, bass guitar sequencer ability to store MIDI files on device.
8744	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Dunlop nylon picks are the best picks out there. I often wonder why people buy anything other than a nylon pick. The stupid plastic things made by Fender and others break so freakin fast, they're not worth the trouble and for the life of my I could never hear any difference in the tone of my guitar depending on the pick used. The thickness of the pick affects the tone, but not the material the pick is made of.

We lost the five-note chimes after we had a party and our house, and one of the guests was clearly enthralled with them. At the end, we gave the chimes to him, which delighted him, and of course delighted us as well. The next day, we purchased the Zenergy3 three-rod version of the chimes, simply to have something different. We are equally happy with the three-tone chime.

3412	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Fits my bass snugly (Chadwick Folding Bass), offers plenty of protection and appropriately placed handles for lifting. While I have a Chadwick Folding bass, I prefer to keep it unfolded as I use Velvet strings, and the tuning/detuning causes a lot of tuning stability issues.

Well, they're certainly lightweight. This comes at a cost though, as they're flimsy and cheaply constructed. Again, not unexpected for the price paid and honestly I'd rather have better sound than build at this price point. If you expect to really beat them up though, they'll most likely not appreciate it from a structural standpoint.
9966	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	My favorite picks by far. The Tortex material is great to prevent the pick from slipping from your hands. The picks come in various thickness, and the blues ones are a good place to start if you're looking for a pick for your electric guitar.
5549	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I purchased 3 of these for my music studio. We have students that play various guitar styles, brands and sizes. These work pretty good for educational purposes but each one varies on the tightness. On my Breedlove Concert guitar, it is a very tight fit. On my Martin 12-String guitar, it fits perfectly. Over time the capo has been able to loosen up a little bit but if you don't want to work it out, you might want to look at a different model.

8954	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks. You simply play faster, no matter what level you are. Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack, is an insane bargain.

If you buy it, make sure you align it properly. Even though conical stylii are supposed to be more forgiving of improper alignment, aligning it correctly does make a big difference. The alignment instructions that come with the cartridge only apply to DJ use and should not be followed for audiophile use. Instead, use an alignment gauge that's compatible with your turntable, or use an alignment protractor.
8622	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	One of the best picks out there for acoustic guitar and mandolin. The only problem is that they wear out fairly quickly.

5571	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my Epiphone SG Pro.  The guitar fits very nicely inside- snug and secure.  The soft, plush interior is very nice and has a large storage compartment in the center.  The case may not be 'heavy duty', but certainly fine for my purpose (transporting between locations).  I don't foresee subjecting the guitar to a situation whereby I needed a more heavy-duty case anyway.  One minor complaint is that the inside of the case had an odor upon arrival which I could not quite identify (it had a smell almost like funky beef jerky- no kidding!).  After leaving the case open for a week, the smell dissipated.

6100	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	First off I am no expert on these things but I can tell you in the brief period in which I have owned my DS-1 I have enjoyed playing/practicing a lot more with this pedal.  I have a Fender wannabe guitar, and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isn't the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested.  I am having so much fun that I don't even notice my fingers hurt anymore.  Honestly, this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police don't come a knockin.

8521	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be.



7735	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I use these on my student violins, upgrading from the stock string because they sound very nice and last so much longer. They seem to stay in tune once broken in as well.
5611	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Purchased for my vintage 1975 12 String Guitar and I'm extremely pleased with this Capo. Well padded so as to protect my guitar neck. Highly recommended!

7802	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are great for low-volume playing.  We use them for practice in my friend's basement, where we have to keep the noise level down.  The rods are a little fragile; beware the edges of the cymbals; they will cut the rods and break them.
My only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no AC adapter at all. Fortunately now there's an adapter from One-Spot that can be connected to a battery lead and then to an AC adapter. Hopefully Amazon will start carrying that soon.

We bought our first set of these, the Zenergy5 with five chimes, as a bit of a lark. They rapidly became a favorite, which use used nearly every day to announce dinner time. The chimes sat on an end table, and nearly every visitor would pick them up and play with them.

Tremolo varies the volume of the sound. It does not vary the pitch.


First of all, it is a Shure microphone. While technology is quickly closing the gap between inexpensive and expensive equipment, the one thing I can say about this microphone that I can't say about many (not all) other low-cost dynamic microphones is that it feels solid when it's held. If it falls to the floor I don't have to worry about it being damaged. Any Shure I've ever used has felt the same way.

5115	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Very high quality they look as nice as my Fender originals .  Make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue / adhesive during installation.  You want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar .
1967	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I was surprised at the design and build quality, it really is worth the price.  Glad I didn't skimp on a cheaper digital scale.
8652	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Ive used many different guitar picks. Even the same manufacture and thickness can vary depending on the material. I used plastic for a long long time but found they wore down too quickly and were quite glassy. These forged have just the right bite and they are durable.

It fit the bill perfectly. My mic is a male and I bought a male to 1/4" cable so I needed something to change my male mic into a female. This worked without gender reassignment surgery and it's very high quality.

6553	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Does the job when you don't want a Kyser or some other big lever and spring capo getting in the way.  The levers of the other more popular capos get in the way sometimes when moving them to the higher frets.  This one you can set and forget.  It is inexpensive and small enough to carry in your pocket.  A good spare in case you run in to a situation where you might want one, but did not bring your main gear... Get two: one for your pocket and one for your case.
3996	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I bought these on a whim -I wanted to try GHS strings- and noticed afterwards that they were .0095, .0115, .016, .024, .032, .044. so I put them up since I just had my Squier Fat Strat set up for 9's.
9719	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Hydraulic and Evans always delivers! Haven't ran these in years but tried them again for a special live situation and they delivered again as always.  They get better with age too because the mylar softens as you play them and the attack gets softer which is especially useful with internal mics!
8853	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Perfect. Love the green. Now I know who stole my capo.
5070	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have two sets of these for my straps.  The push button action is most convenient vs. fighting stubborn leather openings, especially if new.  The gold finish matches my instrument's hardware and they are sturdy and durable.  Works for me!
As an alternative choice the Shure M92E is another widely available and popular P-Mount elliptical option and a fair value too.  Shure now calls the M92E stylus "bi-radial" yet suffix that model with an "E" which has almost always has meant there is an elliptical stylus in a Shure phono cartridge.

3114	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This stand works like a charm--holds guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, etc. etc--anything with a neck and peghead.  Adjusts easily and securely.  Has an elastic strap to keep instrument from falling out of the suspension fork, but I've never found it necessary to use.
These are a great product.  They're very durable, and they produce a warmer tone, with a bit more attack than clear heads.  With the proper tuning, they sound great on just about any kit, for any type of music.  I wouldn't put any other head on my kit!
As far a comfort, these are the single most comfortable headphones ever made.  Period!  They are circumaural, which means they fit completely around your ear.  They completely go around your ear (at least my ear) without any on-ear pressure.  They are light weight and the adjustable band literally makes them weightless.  Within a few minutes you will forget they are on.  I watched a movie on my computer and had these on for about 2 1/2 hours.  There was no strain or pressure anywhere.  My ears and the top of my head didn't feel anything.

You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. Like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. It only took me about half an hour. It clearly states STARTER pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. These people just do not know how to read. It has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. If you want real protection, I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. I highly recommend this product.

It cleaned them right up for me but lost the smoothness totally and left them sliding too easy with no resistance whatsoever. I guess they make specific types of grease for that so if worse came to worse you can re-grease them after cleaning them but it does say that this product is for faders right on the can. I'm still giving it 5 starts because I don't even know if I can count on two hands how many times this product has came to me rescue and bailed me out in repairing and also salvaging gear.

2824	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	These earphones would be good for casual listening, not as a pair headphones to really get the rich sound while in a environment filled with other sounds/music going on.  They do not fit snug, the wire is a straight cord which interferes with movement in/around the mixer and the have a tendency to "slide" around and off  my head.  Ihad to turn the earphone jack up to the max in order to get an audioable level.  I gave them to my son for his personal music.  Would not purchase item.

The light beam isn't narrow/clean enough to do a good job on a mirror ball and the lamp mount is a bit on the flimsy side - it bends very easily. The lamp housing itself is solid though. Careful when taking off the mount as you're going to have a hard time getting the two wheel screws back into the housing.....! Would not buy again.

There are a couple big differences from conventional strings, though. One is that they play quieter. Another is that they don't like to be played very hard -- if you do so, the bass strings sort of flap around as they vibrate and you'll get a lot of buzzing against the frets.

7831	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These strings have a really decent soundconsidering they run $10-15 a set. They are clear, rich, but not twangy--as frequently be the case with steel strings. The color coding is great, too. Makes installation very easy. They are good beginner strings for a child or beginning adult student. Much better than spending $50+ a pop to replace strings every 6 months.

  In the end it's not a top of the line double kick. Bought this on a budget to learn how to play a double kick and for that this pedal is definitely worth it  I'll use this one until I feel I've gotten good enough with double kicks to justify spending 300 on a better one
I would buy this if I was learning to play - I think it could be a comfortable guitar to learn on, but I find it's playability lacking. Or more specifically, I find it playable, but not fun to play.

Without plugging it in, the guitar sounds lovely - that's why I love semi-acoustics!  The natural sustain is very, very impressive.  I'd say this guitar sustains better than my Fender Stratocaster.  The stock pickups sound very good to me.  My other guitars are all equipped with single-coil pickups so I love the contrast the Epiphone Dot's stock pickups give me.  You can eaily get a great sustaining blues or jazz sound.  It can even do some nice jangly sounds on the bridge pickup if I play with the EQ on my amp.  I'm sure if I upgraded the pickups to the Gibson '57 ones the guitar would sound even better, but frankly, I'm totally happy with it stock.

7250	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Aside from the manual, which needs a lot of improvement, this is a good machine with good sounds. One feature it has (which is not mentioned in the manual) is the ability to type in a tempo via the numbered pads. That is very useful for changing tempos rapidly on stage. The manual only lists two ways to change tempo - the dial and tap tempo function. Programming some functions such as changing the individual volumes of drums and cymbals can be very difficult to understand thanks to what I consider a poorly written manual. Where I have succeeded doing this seems to be by accident, and of course, it's difficult to remember what actually worked.

3207	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this rack to replace an SKB roto-molded 8-space unit with wheels and a handle I recently ordered and promptly returned.  While that was a nice unit, it was simply too large and too heavy to carry around a couple times a week.  I would have gone SKB because I've had great experiences with them in the past.  However, after getting that last SKB rack, I wanted to get the smallest and lightest rack I could find to mount my guitar equipment.

If you are like me, and treat your guitar with TLC, then this bag is fine. It is well constructed and has a zipper pouch on the front for storing accessories such as picks and guitar cords.

My ONE complaint, and it's very minor- I don't like the flat butt end on Vater sticks. When I'm occasionally holding them way out on the end, there's a noticeable sharp edge where it's cut flat. I prefer the fully rounded butt end most stick companies produce. But it's a minor gripe.

On the whole, I'd buy this same case (and probably will) for any standard dreadnought sized guitar, Epiphone or not--though I'd make sure to be able to try it on something other than an Epiphone dreadnought before buying.
Vocal mics tend to have a general sound quality in common. They flatten the hills and valleys of your voice and brighten it up. Listen to network news broadcasts and you'll hear what I mean. Speech intelligibility and voice power improves because you voice becomes like a wall of sound that is stronger and brighter. Many cardioid condenser mics also do this, and part of the reason has to do with the cardioid construction resulting in diminished bass and an accented upper midrange.
9359	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I use it for a single beater. I turned mine vertical so I can adjust the height of my beater. Repositionable within roughly 24 hours, after that it loses it's stickiness. I used to use tape for the same effect, but I prefer this patch.

3245	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	What can I say? I like this little thing. I'm a DJ but I don't rock 2 turntables and a mixer anymore. Instead, I sold off one of my precious 1200s and kept the other one for ripping vinyl. That's why I needed a preamp. I picked this one, along with a few others, figuring to audition each one then keep my favorite. This one arrived first, sounds great, and is made in the USA so I didn't even bother auditioning the rest. The volume is nice and loud and I can even run it through my DJ controller's auxiliary input with plenty of volume (probably due more to the trusty Shure M44-7 cartridge that I use). Though it's all subjective, I noticed more definition through the whole spectrum of sound while using this device, as compared to running my 1200 through a Pioneer DJM-450 phono input. I'm half tempted to re-rip my vinyl collection all over again after auditioning this little preamp. Is it audiophile-grade? No, but it's more than good enough for my needs and would have to be better than any built-in preamp in any of the modern turntables available, or even most sub $1500 DJ mixers.
4887	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	This fits my Yamaha CP-50 perfectly, and even if it didn't, the drawstring permits some adjustment. However, only now, after 5 years of using this on a daily basis, I'm getting some deposits of black spandex residue on my keyboard.

6253	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since. I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them.

You won't be disappointed.
Received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door.
Overall I really do like it for what it is and my current stage of gear it fits my needs perfectly, but there are things where I'm still left wanting, mainly the size, and I realize that this board isn't the end all be all board, but it's great for what it is. At some point I'll have to rebuild a board on something bigger and more fitting a larger set up, but until then..

All in all, this machine is amazing. I am a heavy metal guitarist, and I record my own tracks on a Tascam DP-02, and this works great in conjunction with that. This machine works very well with the metal genre, or rock, or any genre at all. It lets me put together full length tracks (from all of my combined patterns I made), does very very well using it in a double bass aspect (you can program the bass to sound like double bass, and as fast as you want), and you end up with very realistic sounding drum tracks! Since I play metal, this is VERY important, since it's hard to find a good drum machine that can go with the metal genre. Last, all I have to do is plug it into my Tascam recorder, and record! Love it! This sounds amazing!
I bought FOUR and not ONE of them makes more than a horrible one-note high-pitched off-tune SCREEKING.

7684	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great sticks for practice and for playing live at church! You can play full throttle with these things without busting drum heads or inverting the eardrums of your fellow band members or "praise team-mates". Helps you to utilize your strength and muscles more to produce sound, making for better reflexes and longer endurance when you play with other sticks.
NOTE: the Sony MDR 7506 are not the answer: they have NO BASS, very tinny, and the ear pads will rot within months whether you use them or not.  Again, they have NO BASS so you'll end up putting too much bass in your mix. Also, the leakage is bad, so you can't use them to track. Kind of useless headphones.

6072	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent low-cost bass. It's not an SG, but it's perfectly playable. The strings were set far too low when it arrived, and everything buzzed. After a little setup work, it played fine, and intonation was remarkably good for an inexpensive instrument. I bought some Fender short scale strings, which had a brighter sound than the strings that came on the bass. It doesn't have a wide range of tones, but you can use downstream modelers to get any sound that you want. It puts out a strong, clean signal, and the short scale is good for us guitar players who play bass only occasionally and find a full scale bass awkward. I plugged it directly into my Focusrite audio interface--worked perfectly.
Can't beat it for the price too!

This foam, by contrast, is a relatively inexpensive way to keep sound from bouncing around inside a room. Discerning music listeners or those recording instruments in their homes can improve the listening or recording environment by using foam to keep sound from bouncing around inside a home. Ever notice how a high-school gym sounds very echoey? This foam (if you had sufficient quantities) could be used to treat such a gym to make it sound more like your living room. Or it could be used to make your living room sound more like the inside of a recording studio: controlled and not overly reverberant.

Another thing I love is the taper that is an essential part of this stick's geometry. What I mean by that is this stick has a pronounced and relatively long taper. If you play Moeller technique that taper aids in achieving the whipping motion that is the key to the technique. As importantly - to me - is the finish that allows me to lightly hold the stick without worrying about it flying out of my hands when they get sweaty.

Record a song live.  In song mode you can hit record and the unit will capture your pattern changes and fills in real time, making it fun and easy to arrange entire songs.  I much prefer this style of arranging to the tedious and time consuming step editing song mode of other machines, though that mode is still an option here if you prefer that workflow.

2769	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires, of course, the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug.

I busk and have demo's that I give away. The Alesis sounds analog. There is a learning curve but I think they all or most has a learning curve.  As an aside, I've had a Alesis machine that is 8 years old.. stayed on most of the time and is still working but showing signs of "old age" however it still works but the volume is down and I have to yank up the recording volume for recording... I'm sure you want an accurate simulation of drum  sounds don't worry about being old school and purchase the SR 16.

I realize that it has a spring and that could wear out over time. I also understand that for some situations a person may wish to go with a traditional capo to guarantee there'll be no hiccups (should I ever record, I'd use a different one in the studio) but for playing, strumming, practicing, even gigging, this is the capo to beat. It works. No fret buzz. Firm on strings. Easy on the guitar neck. Fast on. Fast off. Love it.

7217	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have been using these strings on my dreadnaughts/3/4 sized guitars for quite awhile now and they give a pretty good useful life and get to the point where they will hold a tune faster than some strings I've used in the past. They will not project as much as a normal gauge string, but there are things like microphones and pickups if you need more volume, and they are not as hard to get bar chords near the nut. Normally I play along with harps, whistles, bouzoukis, violins, cellos with a bodhran and these hold their own really well unplugged.

5367	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	they work well. For me, the instalition wasn't that hard, it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast's stock strap system, BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.
84	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I bought this item nearly 10 years ago in a supermarket for 375 Eur (~$450) when it was brand new!
Quality is just great, easy to remove (very easy to grip with your fingers) and what can I say of Hosa,,, these are the cables you want to buy.
Good price + Good quality = Good buy.

By examining the capo you can see that the portion holding the strings is slightly curved concavely with respect to the guitar neck. Most guitars that I've seen are like this, but it wasn't the case for the takamine.
6372	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This capo is awesome, it looks and feels very nice and premium, it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for.
7144	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the SR18 for several months and love it. I am the worlds worst rhythm guitar player, I need a drummer, drum machine or metronome (boring). The sound is great, drum machine or not, I have purchased several computer-based drum machines, and they sound great, but I hate to spend the time to program them. The SR18 includes a wide range of excellent preset beats. But of course the real power is its ability to record your own beats. To be honest, I have not done that. The unit also provides a host of connections. So far I have kept it simple, connecting the Left/Right outs to my mixer.
8378	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	2.0mm is perfect for playing my bass. The dimple keeps it from slipping nicely!
The F3E is best when you need to hold a lot of sheet music. E.g., I bought four of these folders for the several hundred charts used by our swing band; there's over an inch of music in each pocket of each folder.
If you love playing your bell you will definitely appreciate this cymbal because it has a large bell that will cut through and project. Also, when crashed the sustain seems to go on forever, making this ideal as a left ride crash/ride or a far right ride.
3124	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Great update to an already great stand.  I already own two different Ultimate guitar stands, including an earlier version of this stand.  All have been rock-solid and very dependable.  I have used them in travel all over the world, and the way they fold up makes them very easy to pack and take along.  Love the re-design of the headstock cradle.  Holds my P-bass very well, acoustic well, etc.  I never worry about the stand getting knocked over, or the stand damaging my guitar finish.  Best stands there are, in my opinion.

There will always be people who cry and complain when they don't get $1000 performance out of a $100 product. Don't listen to them. They're dumb. You get what you pay for and occasionally, if you're lucky, a little more...this is one of those cases.

524	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Hosa produces my favorite MIDI cables. These metal tipped cables are very durable, and if need be, they are easy to take apart and repair. Recommended purchase for your MIDI setup
I will be a Jazz III user for life now.

Besides using these in a playing situation I also use them to tame down new cymbals. This jazz cymbals are usually wild, trashy when brand new and I like to settle mine in before I use them. Normally that require play-in time. If you want to hasten the play-in process, mallet rolls is a common trick many of us use. This entails taking a pair of these mallets and rolling them around the cymbal for 20 minutes per day for a week or so. Start at the outside edge and work your way towards the bell, going around the circumference of the cymbal.
For those with another guitar, I offer:

I got mine about 8 months ago for ~$60 (i think there might have been a pricing mistake!).

8523	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this for the last couple of years and have been the best fit for Jazz and blues that I've found.
3830	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Started to use them several months ago and really like how they sound, they keep their tone, their shine and stay in tune for longer then some other strings I've used. Don't get me wrong there are better strings out there, but what you get for the money? These are great. Sound  good on my Fender Stratocaster.
For Gibson owners I would recommend this case over the Gibson option for two reasons: 1: It's cheaper 2: Less likely to be a target for thieves if think you are carrying a cheaper Epiphone vs. an expensive Gibson.
You won't regret this one!

2000	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	When comparing the Sennheiser e 835 to the popular SM58, it's a better microphone in most situations.

3896	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've used a lot of different brands and these strings meet and exceed my needs. I play mostly Rock and metal and have a heavy picking hand.

I'll just list out its best features:
9760	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	My set is a Ludwig Blue Vistilite Kit I bought in 1976. Still in mint condition though it has been a road warrior at times. I have tried tons of drum heads from ludwig, Remo, many I don't even remember, but these Evans hydraulics are the best sounding, longest lasting heads I have ever put on it. They last and last, and I play hard, I mean Led Zep, Metallica, Black sabbath hard. The tune up very nice and stay there, more to do with the kit I know, but when I move them from inside to outside and back, Ilet them sit for at least fifteen minutes to acclimate. In the past a lot of heads need tuning from th etemp varince, not these, theyadjust to the temp and I am ready to rock. The oil filled heads give a deep and loud yet snappy tone. I use one gel pad on each head to dampen and that's it. Whether live in the studio at home, or outside on stage, these heads perform. It would take a lot to convince me to use anything else. I'm hooked.
2401	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	VERY GOOD MIKE FOR THE PRICE
The sound is good for this price range. It does not sound as good a a few 5000$ I had chance to play and that's all expected.
3382	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	These strings are a slightly lighter gauge that any other I have found. This makes them a lot easier to fret. They are very reasonably priced and sound great. I've tried more expensive strings but prefer these. I will purchase these next time I buy mandolin strings.
936	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	It doesn't twist up like my standard black cable does, but it will twist a bit over time. Love the angle connection for my guitar side as it doesn't just stick right out there. If you really want to avoid on-stage kinks, then you MUST go wireless, it is the ONLY way to avoids twisted cables - no matter what type you buy. This cable sends sounds to my amp perfectly without distortion. It's worth spending a Jackson, IMO.
4368	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I have to admit i was skeptical as to whether or not these strings would be true to the description, but immediately after putting them on my ibanez AEW multiscale acoustic-electric, i noticed an immediate difference.  They don't feel as tense as my old phosphor bronze strings, and they feel so comfortable.  For those who have always played electrics like myself, and want strings that don't suck, these are for you.

2) Surface noise is also noticably lower (over 7db measured through ProTools in A/B recordings of the same record passages between tracks). Pops and clicks are also diminished greatly-as a guestimate I'd say over a third to almost half, but that is truly subjective based on the damage done by previous playings on my particular used records.
7294	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Fast shipping, great price and most of all great stings, very satisfied would buy these strings again and would recommend to a friend.
6102	Musical_Instruments_5	NEG	2.0	Basic distortion / nothing fantastic. Range is limited . Its a good pedal for someone just starting out. Constructed well looks good sounds less than average. Tried to drive it and it just gets worse. Great pedal for a kid to play with but on stage don't bother.



I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A! I always felt 100% secure with these straplocks.  Our bass player uses some expensive (and heavy) Fender basses and he loves these strap locks.
7271	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Worked so well I ordered two more.

6663	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	After my EQ this is the best addition to my rack, I love it I think I have got my moneys worth and for me it is a great enhancement to my live audio rack. when you turn it on and off you can definitely tell the difference in sound. I have a big gig coming in a few months and I know I will be happy with my production thanks to my BBE882i.
And what I got was a great bass, which had a good tonal range but always sounded warm and never... piercing.  Sometimes, when a person is looking for a punchy bass sound they end up sounding piercing.  I never had any fret buzz or problems with the hardware.  This guitar looks very close to its Gibson counterpart, though they differ, mainly in the fact that the Epiphone has a bolt-on neck.

2941	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I added a Hosa 'on/off' switch to the xlr connector that clips to your belt to make this an outstanding mic. Clean, clear, and easy to wear for hours.

8094	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	You just can't beat these Hohner blues harmonicas in terms of what you get for the money. Very good sound and playablity, durable, and not too expensive but the price does keep going up. I have 7 of them, some go back years and years (I like Lee Oskar harps too, but I prefer the blues harp as it's "throatier"). I see some reviewers have complained that it's hard on the lips or is not very durable; don't know where they're comin' from, no problems for me here (I have a bunch of Hohner Pro harps and they do hurt your lips; as for durabilty: only my oldest blues harp, the A, has a reed out, mainly because I played it for years like a 3 lung madman, the others are in perfect condition). If you want a diatonic harmonica that sounds better than this be prepared to cough up in excess of $100, otherwise get this.
2327	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	it's pretty good as a backup microphone. for when you need some extras for the guest group coming to your church, or those special events. I wouldn't recommend this for your main microphones, that you use everyday and have to sound great. but I would recommend it to someone who just needs a mic for the sake of having a mic. in short, if you need an inexpensive mic, look no further. if you need a real mic, check out the SM58 or some senheisers.
2966	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Satisfactory
3215	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Nice case, strong but light. I think it will do the job. I highly recommend it. I was the one that convinced SKB cases to make them for musicians and I hooked them up with Sam Ash Music in White Plains, New York back in 1986. This is my first non-SKB case.

3244	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	My husband cut the tops off to shorten the height and put the two accross pieces back onto the shortened legs.

1111	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Good product and a good price.
8299	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	One thing to keep in mind, these don't hold different thickness picks very well. I have to use 3 on my main mic stand. Guitar players like myself use thin (50mm) picks on one song and may use an (80mm) on another but playing lead, and most the time, I use a (114mm) small tear drop pick. So keep this in mind. This is why I buy and use the shorter size holders! But they do hold 6 of the normal strumming picks as seen in the photo. Other than that they have always been great. I have plenty of extras and have them on up to 4 mic stands on certain stages in different spots of the stage so I can always have a pick, no matter what size thickness a pick is handy!  When working I am all over the stage so along with my stand I put two on the lead singers stand, one on a horn players stand and even the Bass player makes room for me to put one on his stand. This lets me have picks handy anywhere on the stage. They hold the same size picks really well and the picks always slide out easy and don't hold so tight that I move a stand when pulling a pick!  I even keep one on my amp mic stand lol. But I always have picks handy. Pick holders are a MUST for working guitarist.....  These small ones allow many on each stand!

I'm glad I did my research and chose the SH-4. It wants to rock and is very versitle. It'll take everything you can throw at it and come back for more. It'll satisfy many players of many styles, from light to hard and heavy, the SH-4 doesn't disappoint. The pros know quality hardware and you can too. Get it and get rockin'.

2118	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I had to replace my 15 year old needle on my turntable. I had a Shure RX3P cartridge on it, so I went looking for a replacement. This model is it.

I have old 70s Panny speakers, since I didn't have the room for the big Technics when we moved (Those are being enjoyed by a friend). So i cut the RCA plugs off of them and stuck the wires into the back of my old Sony reciever and they work.

I don't know how to rate it, other than it costs $7 and it works.  I'd pay that again if i ever needed a replacement.  It doesn't appear to be cheaply made, and i feel it will last forever, so long as i'm not constantly walking on it while it's on a hardwood floor

Love these picks!
I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.

Connections are made from the L/R line outputs of the keyboard to the pedal.  Then from the pedal outputs to the amplifier(s).  It works perfectly without any other setup.  The pedal action is just stiff enough so it holds position if you move your foot off the pedal, and the volume limiter knob ensures you won't accidentally cut off all sound.  There is an "out" for a tuner but that's not particularly useful for a keyboardist.

I realize that it has a spring and that could wear out over time. I also understand that for some situations a person may wish to go with a traditional capo to guarantee there'll be no hiccups (should I ever record, I'd use a different one in the studio) but for playing, strumming, practicing, even gigging, this is the capo to beat. It works. No fret buzz. Firm on strings. Easy on the guitar neck. Fast on. Fast off. Love it.

You can always buy pedals to get all those cool sounds, and I plan on doing that too, but you need a good amp with a good clean channel like this one before you start getting into other effects.

The "vibe" effect (it's actually a Univibe-type effect, not true vibrato) sounded very "fake" to me (not at all like the Cool Cat Vibe from the same company). There was a noticeable volume drop when the effect was engaged, and I also heard some noise in my signal chain when the effect was not engaged. Combined with the (known) cheap construction, that made this pedal a big disappointment.

I visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!

This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician, I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics, mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining, I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169, you can't expect to have the top of the line.

4235	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	My Epiphone dot is China made, and I had big fears but picked it up anyway. Epiphone oversees the production of these guitars and let me tell you, flawless. No worries at all. Plays great, looks great as it plays, and I did what any intelligent person would do, I put in Gibson 57 humbuckers and man alive, she wails.  I think Gibson has crazy prices and exploits players with price tags too high. Maybe they will sell more if they cut prices in half or more, until then, Epiphone is just as good in my book anyway. Take it from an old sea bass who has played 45 years and owned just about every top brand guitar out there. .

314	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!

Thankfully I found these strings which are light enough to cut her some slack while she builds up strength and durability in her fingers.

8445	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These picks are smaller than your average pick. My old guitar teacher turned me on to them for speed and accuracy, and I have never looked back. You'll pay much more for them at your local GC, so it's definitely worth getting them here.

These are a great product.  They're very durable, and they produce a warmer tone, with a bit more attack than clear heads.  With the proper tuning, they sound great on just about any kit, for any type of music.  I wouldn't put any other head on my kit!
Overall, it's a good case despite the number of cons as it delivers on the most important requirements.  Would buy again if I couldn't find something with more handles.
7624	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Okay, so I didn't buy this from Amazon. Not a big deal. Have bought this pickup used, several times, sold it several times and ended up with it again. I'm a tinkerer and a bit of a gear hoarder - I've tried tons of aftermarket pickups; almost all Seymour Duncans, Dimarzios, WCR, Wolfetone and Sheptone. No brand of pickup really sounds like the other and all of them have been great, never really had a "bad" pickup per say. Every guitar responds differently to pickup changes for that matter too, but when it comes down to it I have used the 59' in my superstrat, Les Paul, PRS and back again. The tone is rather neutral, full of presence and somewhat bright (which is a trademark of many Duncan pickups). In the neck of a guitar it is capable of getting crunch, growl, bite and snarl - all depending on what you want it to do and what amp you might be using. Has just about the perfect amount of output too - not too weak like a T-Top or PAF, but not to high strung yet firm, never can overwhelm it with too much gain either it seems. Always clear sounding with warm overtones. Versatility is the name here and depending on how you set you eq, you can achieve nearly any tone you set out to get. Countless and nameless artists rely on the 59' in the neck position of their guitars - it's almost and industry secret.

8758	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	A good pick even if a bit smooth and harder to hang on to as some others.
they are also not nearly as durable as solids sticks. after enough rim shots and crashes the dowels break one by one. so if you are a heavy hitter bring extras. however, since most people are trying to take down the volume with these and hitting light, this is less of an issue.

What a difference once they were installed! It is almost like listening to a different records. All the things mentioned in previous reviews about the needle holding the groove are spot on. As previous reviews have also stated, follow the instructions on setting up your tonearm and you will have a rock solid needle that can handle whatever you throw at it. Highly recommended.

7565	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Ok, I don't want to knock anyone else who has given this pickup a bad review, here or on any other site, but for the life of me I cannot understand why. This pickup is not meant to have pure chunk. This pickup is made to sound like Dimebag, and have Dimebag's sound. And it does! Anyone that argues that point, its a fact they're dead wrong. I know this for two simple reasons, 1.) I own this pickup in one of my Dean Dimebag custom guitars, and 2.) because it IS THE EXACT SAME pickup that Dimebag used! Any other problems not being able to achieve his sound, is due to their guitar that this sits in, the pedals and effects they are using, the players style and ability to achieve his sound, and the head and cab that are being used. Like I said, not trying to knock any other reviewers, but I'm just stating the facts, in a non offensive way.
4429	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These strap retainers are really great for an autoharp. I was given an autoharp to try, but found it way to heavy as when it rested on my arm the weight of the instrument made it difficult to hit the right chord buttons.  I got a D'Aigle slider strap to use for the autoharp. The round objects attach to the strap and you lift up the autoharp, which has the screws placed one per side. ( Be sure to read instructions well, so the screws are in the exact correct location. ) The screws click into the round objects, and the whole unit keeps the autoharp up higher without hurting your arms. For myself, I had to shorten the slider strap on the sewing machine to make it the right size for me. It feels very secure & you can tell it is not going to fall apart & let the autoharp hit the floor. If not for the slider strap and the strap retainers, I would not have even tried to play the autoharp. I see that people use these on guitars as well. You do have to drill holes, so obviously if you did not want holes in the instrument this would not be for you.
Its not a metal distortion, but for classic rock crunch, this pedal does just fine.  I actually stacked it up against my script era MXR Distortion + and I was able to dial in a tone that sounded very similar, if just a touch less transparent.

What it does best is replace that built in microphone on your DV handheld recorder that picks up the motor noise and every click of the buttons you press.

7852	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	After many years away from guitar playing, I wanted a lush chorus for a new acoustic guitar with built-in preamp. At first I did have the sound guys use our one rackmount effects unit in our church to insert a chorus on the guitar channel at the mixer, but then the vocalists lost reverb and delay. I was bummed because the chorus sound throughout the system was awesome with the rack unit. I was hoping I could get a pedal to provide that same rich sound, but I didn't think a pedal would be capable of providing the rich tone of a higher-[riced rackmount unit. But I started browsing for different FX pedals and I kept seeing Electro-Harmonix products pop up, still looking the exact same as they did in the 70s, and was amazed they were still around. OK, to the point: every review I read for chorus stomp boxes kept pointing back to the EH sounding the best which I did not expect in 2015. So I bought one knowing returns are a breeze on Amazon, lol. I plugged in a Fender acoustic into this Small Clone and into a DI box and on to the mixer, and the chorus sound blew my socks off, plain and simple. The sound was HUGELY lush, I could have sat there and played all day. It was a couple hours before the service was to start and there were people milling about the sanctuary, and they stopped and commented on the rich guitar sound throughout the room, and I was just lightly strumming some major and minor 7 chords. I am absolutely stuck on this EH Small Clone chorus, it sounds more amazing than I had hoped for. FYI, I do keep the switch on the deep selection. Absolute 5 star sound, and Made in the USA. Sold!

1709	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Look, it's a shortish adapter cable - there's not much more to say. It looks to be well-made and it works fine with no noticeable noise. However, note that the 1/8" cable does not work well into Apple 1/8" sockets: They are designed not to grip non-Apple plugs, which need a beefier (i.e. larger diameter) plastic case to fit tightly into the socket. That's not the cable's fault, it's Apple's...
Update: Roland basically fixed my important concerns with the new version of the Micro Cube, the GX. it's over a pound lighter, the power switch is on top where it belongs, plus it's got more features like the Cube Jam software ( which I don't really use but it looks cool).

I think these compare favorably to the Red Label strings, although these aren't quite as indestructible.  However, I think the sound is superior to Red Label and is probably among the top tier for steel core strings, especially without shelling out lots of cash.  That said, I prescribe these Preludes only as a temporary bridge until the player is ready to move to synthetic core strings, such as the Pro Artes.
7053	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I gave this pick 5 stars because the feel and sound you get from them are outstanding. This material really makes the strings sound brighter and clearer.
I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.

9554	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Kyser makes what I believe to be the best 6-string capos on the market. Simple one-handed on and off and constant, sure contact with all strings across the fretboard's radius make this a no-brainer. Kysers are sprung with the right tension, and used with anything but ultra-light gauge strings, rarely necessitate retuning if the guitar's action is set low enough.
Good price for me!!!!!
I also make videos, and this has been a wonderful investment for interviews. Clip it on and upgrade your audio quality x2.
Highly recommend for those who like medium thickness picks.
9743	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These picks work great. I play both electric and acoustic guitar (sometimes in the same set) and this gauge works well for both.

The only bad things about this design are that you need a pretty small phillips screwdriver to install the button on your guitar (the tip has to fit inside the locking hole.  The screws that some with the Straplok have a special narrow head to fit.  You do need to get these strap buttons on tight for it to work securely.  The other bad thing (mentioned in many reviews) is that the strap attachment sits the full height of the button away from the guitar body (they didn't want to make you drill a big hole in the guitar so the hole would be sunken under the surface.  If you use your strap as strain relief for your cord, it makes it work less effectively.

This capo is easy to use and light weight. Fits in your pocket and has a great design. It's the easiest and most convenient capo to use! Don't worry about it affecting the sound of your guitar, it holds a tune very well and doesn't leave any indents on your strings. It's durable and it takes a second to move it from one fret to another. Best choice in my opinion.

I know this case is the real deal,  it has fallen over on me twice (I wasn't paying attention and knocked it over)  and no damage to my keyboard or the case itself.  I was surprised.  The wheels are awesome too.  Never carry if you don't have to.
9107	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I came to electric bass from playing upright bass, so I've always preferred my fingers over picks.  I've tried some different picks, but they always gave me less control than my fingers.  These, however, are great.  Because they're short, they feel like an extension of my fingers, and the indentations make for a very secure grip.  It's not clear from the product page, but you get a package of 6 (all one color in my case) when you order these.
5056	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I don't like to post a review unless I have new information to add.  So... the only thing I would add to the other reviews on this item is that what I said in the title:  Heavier microphones may bounce a bit when using these mounts.  The plastic is sturdy to stay in place, but a bit flexible.  It has to be to allow you to bend the clip over the rim of the drum.  I use different mics for different drums and noticed that a Shure SM57 stays in place pretty good, but other mics I've used (including the Sennheiser MD 421 and others) tend to cause the end to flex under the weight of the mic--especially when miking the resonant side (bottom head) of the snare.  So if you use heavier microphones than SM57s, be aware that they could bounce a bit during recording/performance.

8085	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	These are my go-to picks. The grips work great on stage and tend not to fly out of my hand as I'm using them. I tend to turn them on edge using the side to really dig in. Couldn't imagine using any picks other than these.
If you search youtube for Bingo969 - everything from 1 month ago and newer was shot with the Zi8 and this microphone. Picked up a fair mixture of straight rock to acoustic to bluegrass.  For most situations I would definitely suggest this mic. It's worth it, especially if you catch it on sale.
After some searching and reading many Amazon reviews this was my choice and I am pleased because it's a beauty to look at and sounds really nice. My smile when doing my self taught lessons was because of my surprise at the sound coming from this instrument and the Fender Mustang I.
7424	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	These strings are very bright and full.  They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead.  I haven't had any problems with breakage, just a loss of tone over time (seems faster than some other strings I've tried).

2568	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a keyboardist, but bought this for my daughter.  I have played around with it quite a bit and find the sound amazing.  It's most obvious flaw (small keys with only three octaves) can easily be solved.  We have a cheap, old Casio with full size keys and six octaves.  I just ran a MIDI cable out from the Casio into the Microkorg and, voila, you can play the Casio and hear the Microkorg.  Of course, I also had to buy a dual mount stand (which looks really cool), but it improved the usefulness of the Microkorg threefold.  Also, each voice on the Casio creates a new sounds with each voice on the Microkorg.  If you have the Casio volume down all the way, you can't hear its output; or, you can run a cable into the amp and hear both the actual sound of the Casio voice PLUS the Casio/Microkorg voice PLUS the Microkorg voice by itself (if you reach up and hit those keys).  Needless to say, this creates millions(?) of possible sounds.  So, get the Microkorg, get a dual mount keyboard stand, and buy some cheap old keyboard off of Craigslist, and you're set.
7172	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Can't beat this for  useable drum patterns that are very configurable, after a few YouTube instruction videos.  These drum machines aren't very user friendly for anything other than changing volume, tempo, and a/b switch or pre-loaded rhythms. This is considered "outdated" but, if you do anything other than rap, funk, you will appreciate this machine.  I bought this after selling a Boss  670 drum machine that had really funky, Loud and unusual drum patterns (had great tone, clearity, rich sound) that I could never figure out how to do anything with it, other then change tempo, volume and a/b pattern switch.

Im using this for my home studio, tracking and mixing. since they aren't made for tracking and do not prevent leakage at a 100% rate I'd recommend to use a lower volume when tracking.  still if you have budget, get headphones that are dedicated for tracking so you wouldn't have to even be concerned for sound leakage.

It's really a pleasure to twist the knobs and get some crazy sounds and they sound AMAZING! They keys are real punchy! but fun to hit.

2027	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I had to replace my 15 year old needle on my turntable. I had a Shure RX3P cartridge on it, so I went looking for a replacement. This model is it. And it fit perfectly, and plays my old records with decent sound reproduction. I have old 70s Panny speakers, since I didn't have the room for the big Technics when we moved (Those are being enjoyed by a friend). So i cut the RCA plugs off of them and stuck the wires into the back of my old Sony reciever and they work.
On my SG I had to cut the screw down a little with a rotary tool so I wouldn't have to drill further into the body to accommodate the different screw design. It was a hassle but all said and done the guitar feels fine with it.

This particular capo is designed for a steel stringed (not classical) 6 stringed acoustic guitar although it can be used with a slimmer necked 12 string and it's just fine.  This company does make this capo for classical, electrics, and 12 stringed guitar as well as a large variety of colors/pattern.  This is our second Kyser 6 String capo as the first one lost the clear rubber end that protects the back of the neck while in use.  That one was used for years and could still be used if we could have only found the clear rubber thing.  They do loosen up a bit over time with a lot of use, but still always seem to work.  Never had a problem with fret buzz--but that could also be in part the guitars we use it with.  Would highly recommend this capo as it was highly recommend to us originally but another long time guitarist.

It's not that they didn't work right, but the fact that they just weren't for me. I am very good with computers, do photography editing, and music editing, etc, all on the few computers I own. As far as doing drums on my computer, It just wasn't clicking. Everyone has to find their path of least resistance, and THEIR best method for doing things, since everybody is different and everyone has their own path of least resistance. Hence, to each, their own. What works best and is the easiest for one person, may be the most complicated for the other. What is most complicated for you, may be the easiest for the other person.

Compared to the Fender Stratocaster Squire or the Epiphone Les Paul Special 2; the Epiphone LP-100 severely outshines both in construction, tone, and overall quality. I wish I had known about this model before starting my guitar journey with a Fender Squire Strat Pack - which is absolute garbage even with a proper setup. What I thought would be a step up from that pile was an Epiphone LP Special 2; while it isn't the worst choice it wasn't a good one. That guitar was a plank of wood and the tone reflected that. Stear clear of those models. They will end up in a closet gathering dust. They both suck to play and I really do mean that.

6061	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This has been the biggest selling distortion pedal since its release in 1978.  I didn`t know why until I bought one and tried it the other day.  It has a very rich and musical sounding distortion. Not like heavy metal pedals which only have tons of gain but don`t sound musical at all.  I must say it`s a breath of fresh air in today`s world where the music is crap now. I find it to be a very versatile pedal as you can play many songs from Chuck Berry`s "Johnny B. Goode (distortion half-way) to 80s hard rock(distortion from half-way to all the way up depending on the song)  Musically, it has enough gain to cover almost anything you would want to play accept for something like crappy black metal or some other non-musical noise. Since I bought this distortion pedal I haven`t needed to buy another one because this has done everything that I have needed it to do. I recommend turning the tone knob all the way down or it will have too much treble.

It is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge.  I am glad I got the DS-1 but for other reasons.  Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock.  Again for the money I don't think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley.  Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive (OCD or Boss OD-3) but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need.  In closing, spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later.

7006	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	These are nice, I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am.  Once these are worn, as with most picks, they sound considerably different.  Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  They stay in your fingers well.
As stated earlier I have a rep who seems to be more proactive and diligent.  I'm hoping she will resolve this situation to satisfaction.  I will update my review after the outcome.  Until that time though, I would strongly recommend not purchasing anything from Ultimate Support.

3224	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	The stand is stable and seems well made and sturdy. V-shaped grip accommodates finger boards of various widths. I am using the stand for a large bass viola da gamba, and I'm so pleased with it that I have ordered another for my tenor gamba.
I avoided the fancier model with arms that swivel down when you rest the headstock in the cradle. That's the kind of thing that gets in the way and breaks after just a few months of bouncing around with all the other stands in the truck. (Been there - done that...)

1059	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	The cable worked fine and I like having 25 feet to move around while playing but ultimately, after about 6 months of use, the metal part of the jack separated from the cable and the jack stayed in the amp. I probably stepped on it without knowing so maybe my own fault... I ordered another one but with the 90 degree angle at the amp end. They are a good value and shipping is pretty fast.

3331	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me, it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they don't want to use the SM58 anymore :)
9977	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	After years and years of using blankets, pillows, and foam of all shapes and sizes, I took a "gamble" on this, just to see if it was really the "bee's knees," as many people claim.  I don't know why it sounds so good, but when coupled with the EMAD bass drum head, also by Evans, there really is something magical about this damper.  I highly recommend trying it.
4805	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I've used the Dunlap Straplok's for years...recently I tried the Schaller strap lock.  Both seem as sturdy as the other.  The Dunlop still uses an E-Clip to hold the hardware onto your strap while the Schaller has a threaded nut.  A toss-up between the two strap locks, but the Dunlop has never failed me and is a better priced locking unit.  Plus the Dunlop's are available in chrome, stainless and black to highlight your sweet axe!

The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.

It really brings the trebble out of your picking style.
The pathfinder adds enough of the warm VOX tone I was looking for with all knobs set at 12 o'clock and the channel set to clean. I can make adjustments to tone with the SG Pro's volume/tone knobs and coil tapping. I'm not looking for extreme sounds - so generally I use the Stomplab for some variety of reverb, delay, and/or chorus AND the pedal is a big plus for master volume control. If I want gain/overdrive/distortion - I leave the pathfinder alone. I rely on the stomplab for the gritty sound I want. It has a much better capacity to deliver in that arena.
3182	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I've had this holder for a year now. My guitar didn't fall, didn't have any issues with this. And mind you, I have a Jackson Kelly, which is not a regular shaped guitar, the foam at the legs of this stand holds the guitar in shape, secures it nicely.
6772	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I sometimes play an acoustic and electric on stage and I route them both through my AX8 amp modeler and into a pa, this switch works perfectly for it. Just switch guitars and step on the button and I'm good to go, no switching cables or anything.
9165	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Love these!
Even though it's acoustic music (they don't even use true bass instruments), there's a lot of music between 30 and 70 Hz.  So contrary to the opinions of music elitists who frown at "bassheads" and the bass heavy products, we really do need good bass reproduction for all sorts of music.  What the elitists who give this product a high rating call "flat" or "neutral" is misleading.  Flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum.
3) Many outstanding guitar players have used this pedal in the studio and on the road, including Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, etc... Sure, some are using "modified" versions now, like Vai's Keeley edition. But you don't tamper with what you don't like. If the foundation isn't solid, you replace it. I also own the Ibanez Vai Jemini pedal and what they basically did (in my opinion) was take his tube screamer and DS-1 pedals and put them into one box for convenience. Same thing with Satriani's Vox Satchurator pedal. You know someone really loves a pedal when they use it as a template in designing their own signature line. I don't have any proof that they did this, but it does sound like it in a side-by-side comparison.
9510	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	good and helps make the sound sing

8333	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I bought these picks after reading that many pro players use them. They are small and pointy which is good for fast playing and they sound more crisp and clear than other rounded picks I've used. Try them, you won't be disappointed.
250	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Just a basic pedal, I use it with my Alesis drum machine, works great, never fails.
There are only three controls - two knobs (Volume and Tone) and a toggle switch that selects which humbucker pickup (neck or bridge or both) you want to use. I was honestly astounded at the ease of play, the quality of both the build, the sound and the easy transition from acoustic to acoustic electric to straight electric.  Of course, I could have (and nearly did) spend a lot more - but I am a beginner on this - an admittedly old one. But, I am having the time of my life rocking out with the volume up (when no one else is home!)

UPDATE (8/2014):  I am STILL using these MIDI cables years later, and they are holding up like champs.  They've been tossed around and mutilated in all sorts of bags and cases.

6576	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	This capo does it's job, but probably will wear out with constant use.
7871	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	I have been researching Chorus Pedals for Bass for quite some time...While many other companies offer the complex styles of chorus modulation and your abilities to alter the sound the pedal creates it all seemed laborious for a bass player...I mean Kurt Cobain used the simplicity of the EHX Chorus so take that into consideration for a moment. After many YouTube demos i decided to go with the EHX for the bass...I didn't want an overpowering chorus sound for the mix, nor did i require the multiple abilities to alter the sound. I now view this as an essential pedal for my board. Its one knob and depth switch keep the sound interesting to a crowd but it doesnt take the attention off of the entire band or the beautiful music we are all creating, but when the bass solo appears the crowds are in awe of the sounds that can be produced. Its a little bigger than your average EHX stompbox and the 1/8" power jack is confusing why EHX would continue with, but if youve purchased a powered pedal board you should get a minimum of 2 1/8" jacks (such as the SKB line) if not the visual sound package for 9v has three for you. I would have prefered the vintage, but found the reissue simpler to get immediately. The only negative i have noticed is that although it does not take away from the dry signal I have noticed that it does drop my gain very slightly. As for the pop/click when activating the pedal, just stomp down a tad harder...i have tested it multiple times and when i lightly activate it pops but when i put my big boy pants on, get into a gnarly bass solo and stomp that box...no pop!

Pros -

1437	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I never really considered a cheaper cable, I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon, I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.
8491	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Love it !!! Super vivid in color and looks great !
The thicker acetal picks I had worked well for this purpose, but I only had two.  Hence, a search on Amazon and finding the 2.0mm Dunlop Big Stubby Pick and its reviews.  And from there to the store, I got the baggy of purple picks.  They felt great in hand, but the proof was when I got home and got to the guitar.

3573	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	I thought I'd gotten a good base guitar, you know one you can get cheap and make it scream as you get the money.  And I had received exactly what I thought.  A well made epiphone in need of some minor tweaks......so I bought new pups and new grover tuners.  I haven't installed them yet because when I bought a digitech rp360,,,,,well didn't need too,  It screams on its own now...crystal clear.  no muddy tones.  I am in love with this guitar.  So if you have bad sound system a good guitar sounds bad.  A good sound system and a mediocre guitar will scream.  Get both  you won't regret it.

861	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	4.0	Works great as all around cable, particularly well for my vintage Fender with straight down receptacle on body face of guitar. Works great for bottom plug in on PRS.

6208	Musical_Instruments_5	POS	5.0	Ultex picks sound a bit jangly on my Martin dread so I use something else, but these babies really brought my Gibson jumbo to life like nothing else did. I had tried everything to coax an exciting sound out of that big old box, but these picks finally did it. They were a total revelation: bright, crisp, clean, upfront sound. Easy to hold, fast and slick, they feel good against the strings and boy, do they sing. I use the 73's for flatpicking or digging into blues, and the 60's are great for smoother rhythm playing. Sometimes in a pinch I'll even use a 1.0 on the mandolin, although it's not my first pick, so to speak. Contrary to other reviews citing indestructibility, I have found they do create dust from being shaved against the strings, which is a little strange and a just a tad messy, but it's more than worth it for the sound. My only gripe at this writing: how come the 60's run a buck-fifty more per six pack than the 73's do?  Oh, the injustice.

So imagine my surprise when I get a used DS-2 for a steal on ebay and its actually a good pedal!  This pedal does what the DS-1 was SUPPOSED to do but failed at:  Its a good, general purpose distortion.  Its not a super saturated sound, but its a likable tone that's far more full than the DS-1 ever got.  Also unlike the DS-1, it sounds great on every amp I've tried it on (one of which seems to hate boss pedals, so I was very impressed by that).

I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didn't care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with.
