4889	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the only rock albums that I have ever heard that just hearing the name of the album "Beyond Belief", gives me goosebumps! This is the quintessential Christian rock album of all time. I love Whitecross, Stryper, White Heart, Mastedon, Guardian, etc., but nothing hits home like this album did for me, not to impune the great works by those other groups.
the opening track "WPLJ" is actually a cover of an obscure doo wop song about a unique beverage that is allegedly very refreshing. the ingredients needed to make this tasty concoction are White Port (wine)and Lemon Juice..WPLJ!! although i never heard the original version, i will assume that zappa's version is more enjoyable to listen to. zappa sings lead vocal on it, an activity he'd temporarily abandon for the most part when Flo & Eddie were to arrive 2 albums later. such a catchy toe-tapper and a great way to open up an album.
Ram is a major improvement over McCartney. Paul still has some of the hominess here but he actually spent time recording these songs, whereas on McCartney, he had recorded at home with no other musicians assisting him. This gives Ram a big edge over McCartney; it's, simply, more professional. "Monkberry Moon Delight" is another standout track. Sir Paul may never be remembered as a great lyricist as his former partner John Lennon is considered, but let's do remember this: Sir Paul is certainly a great song craftsman which is all we really need to know.
Illigal I song- 4/5 Good song, but the singing kinda drags on a little

While many fans can agree that his work from the past such as "Born to Run", "The River", and "Nebraska" was more in-depth and had more substance, "Born in the USA" reached out to more fans than ever before.

With a set of twenty one songs, Elton includes great renditions of, "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me", "Tiny Dancer ", "Burn Down the Mission" and, of course, "The One" (it was "The One" tour).  Elton John also pays tribute to Queen's Freddie Mercury by singing, "The Show Must Go On'.  It is the only song in which he gets up from his piano and prances around the stage.  The finale is a beautiful rendition of "Your Song" and the instrumental "Song For Guy".

2. Eulogy - A very confusing song. With the lyrics here, many woudl assume that Maynard is making reference to Jesus Christ. However, it is spoken metaphorically (key word there) and can be taken anyway. As with all music that is written for the listener.... When you listen to this album, absorb it. This is one of the best Tool songs in my opinion only b/c it is so powerful. 10/10

3820	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Today, I got Volumen Plus DVD based on the reviews here at Amazon, particularly with regards to the nudity in two of Bjrk's videos.  Although the videos were tastefully and artistically done well (reflecting Bjrk's talents as a visual artist), as a guy, I have to say that my expectations were not quite met.  In Pagan Poetry, she was filmed either too close or too far away for her [mammary glands] to be fully seen; maybe it should have been filmed at multiple angles.  As for Cocoon, it seemed as though she was covered with powder, and like Pagan Poetry, you couldn't get a real sense of Bjrk's physical beauty.  But then, if that's the only thing a person looks for in a video, then you would be better off watching a performance by someone like the "talented" Britney Spears.  In fact, the videos that I liked the best are It's In Our Hands and Alarm Call, which are both set in a forest/lagoon.  I really liked the interplay between Bjrk and the animals in Alarm Call and the dress that she wore in the video.  In my opinion, I think Alarm Call (one of the two up-tempo videos on the disk) did more to promote her beauty than either of the videos where she appeared nude.
8774	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	The liner notes would tell you that Frank Zappa pieced "Does Humor Belong In Music?" from miles of tapes across his 1984 tour; guitar solo from Philly, vocal from London.

I recommend it to anyone who loves Sinatra and Ella. Jobim was good too.

  "Indian Sunset" is an almost anthemic track about the plight of native Americans in their historic war against the white settlers. Taupin combines the situations of different tribes throughout these wars, culminating in Geronimo "laying down his weapons as they filled him full of lead." Buckmaster's strings pound out a great tribal setting for this oftentimes fanciful story. Taupin was not entirely accurate historically (the term "squaw" was purportedly never used by real native Americans), relying on pure atmosphere.

This is brilliant, and a must-have for Bowiephiles and Eno fans alike. Also check out Iggy Pop's The Idiot, which was released around the same time, a collaboration with Bowie and also recorded in Berlin; it's very similar in mood and sound to Low and the rest of the Berlin Trilogy.

Nevertheless, there are still grooves to dance to, such as the funky 1984 and, of course, the Chant of the Ever-Circling Skeletal Family (it's a short dance).
For many years, while i was learning to sing, "Heart of the Country" was as example, as long as Abbey's "Oh Darling!".

This 1998 release from Collectables, which provides only We'll Sing In The Sunshine, Lovin' Place and The Prism Song, is essentially a re-issue of her first LP, My Kind Of Folk Songs (RCA Victor LPM/LSP-2833) - tracks 1 to 12 - with the addition of five "bonus" tracks including the hit versions of We'll Sing In The Sunshine and Lovin' Place. Tracks 14-16 are from her 1965 LP "The Many Faces Of Gale Garnett" (RCA Victor LPM/LSP-3325
To further justify my admiration for this woman, I want to note the nuanced performance of the Queen classic, "Who Wants to Live Forever." At the beginning of the song, she looms on a dias silhouetted against a dusk-blue backdrop of roiling sky, arms out, the light coming up to reveal her hair windblown back from her face. Forward movement is implied, and I was reminded of the figurehead on the prow of a galleon, resolutely looking out over a harsh seascape. She sings of a mournful resignation to mortality, but her posture is one of defiance, her chin tilted to take the blow of the elements: "There's no time for us/ there's no place for us/ What is this thing that builds our dreams/ yet slips away from us?" This contrast between determination and resignation extracts even greater irony from the lyrics, and while Queen's version is good in its own right, this cover by Sarah enriches it; she makes the song her own.
1. A running commentary of the concert or, if that's not feasible, an extended interview with Paul Simon.

Classifying their genre is more complicated than some of the reviewers and critics have made it.  The only thing that seems really Country about their sound is the lack of electric instruments, and personally I don't think acoustics actually equals Country. But that leaves the other side of the coin, without electric guitars predominating is it Rock & Roll? I don't know. I'll leave such battles to the kind of purist that said if George Benson sings it isn't Jazz.

Whilst I don't have the DVD I have the video which has a fine transfer and no dubbing so this review is based mainly on that. This is very good.

But, I LOVE the blend of contemporary artists with Santana's  longtime sound. I have been listening to this for weeks now. Bought it  because of "Smooth", which is the ultimate, but with repeated  listening I am hearing other gems in there, like "Love of my  Life" and "El Farol" and "Migra".  What a totally  beautiful album.
The overall technique of younger players and the amount of educational information on flatpicking has exploded since this record came out in the 70's. But for my money, few can touch it for pure soul.
band like they have played together for years. All top flight musicians in their prime. The rhythem section of Harvey Mason (on drums) and Marcus Miller (on bass) set a tight groove that engages throughout and Grusin plays with energy a few notches above his typical tv show, jingle-like melodies.
It is great to hear it from the band members.  It is good to hear the band explain that the songs were just that...songs.  There were no secret meanings, spiritual or otherwise.  If you "dig" the sound of the Moody Blues, past or present, you'll enjoy this DVD.
It's a good album if you are in the mood but this album ranges from schizo to full blown dementia of any kind. The way the tracks just jump in and out together make it one of the more taxing Zappa album there is. Although hats off for the track Prelude to The Afternoon of a Sexually Aroused Gas Mask for having the weirdest and most hilarious title ever. Admittedly showing this to your friends will have them think you're off your rocker but nevermind that.

"We Gotta Get out of This Place" (1965). Another of their greatest hits.  The guitar work at the outset sets the stage for what follows.  Organ work, again, is great.  Key line:
YES, the audio is far, far superior to the VHS version which was reverb-y and filled with audience noise and mush. This is pristine, wonderfully remixed from the masters, music. Most artists do NOT bother to go directly back to the original masters. Dave and Co. Did. However, it comes at a slight cost: One of These Days was butchered. They left off all the special fx material following Guy Pratt's bass feature in the middle, leaving Rick Wrights superb, ingenious hi freq, cross channeling space music on the cutting floor, and the wonderful echoplex-like digital delay on Dave's pedal steel guitar was woefully dropped in favor of the more staid, cleaner master mix direct to the board from the instrument. I object, respectfully, David. Put it back.

Having been in the Strawbs, Fairport Convention, and Fotheringay, she had pretty well demonstrated she had the chops and talent to venture out on her own. Still, this album features most of her Foteringay alumni, so in many places it sounds like Fotheringay II. It has more of a folky feel than her later albums (in fact my favorite is the lone traditional "Blackwaterside"). With songs like "Down In The Flood" and "Let's Jump The Broomstick", she began to stretch out.

After several years of quiet in the studio, Santana is joined by his seasoned contemporary Eric Clapton and by such young luminaries as Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Rob Thomas, and Fher (of famed Mexi-rockers Mana). As an album that caps a rock career spanning more than three decades, SUPERNATURAL is a testament to the stylistic breadth of Carlos' musical world, to his dynamic communicative abilities, and to the fact that rolling stones truly gather no moss. The man continues to make a guitar wail like no other.

Overall, The Children is a great, brutal horror film; a film that'll make you look at children differently. It is very entertaining, and a great update to the psycho children genre. I recommend a purchase for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.
However, a brief overview of the themes contained can easily differentiate this album from anything else recorded recently, possibly ever recorded: 'Stinkfist' concerns opening up to another person on a previously unexplored level, with the songs meaning delivered to us shrouded in a metaphor rather crudely suggested by the song's title, whilst Eulogy tackles the status of an unnamed friend who 'Had a lot of nothing to say' as a martyr, or otherwise.
"Ram" is not a flawless album.  "3 Legs" is rather tepid, cliched blues until it hits its stride in a brief section where the tempo changes and it really grooves.  Also, Paul drags the fade-outs too long in "Smile Away," "Monkberry Moon Delight" and "Long Haired Lady."  And "The Back Seat of My Car" is a delightful song, but its lyrics sound as sentimental and contrived as a bad made-for-TV movie.  Finally, there is something slightly claustrophobic about much of the album's lyrical content.  So many songs are about how great Linda is and how great it is being at home with her in the countryside.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, and Paul's one-sided presentation of their relationship almost seems calculating, like a politician trying to court favor by trotting out the wife for campaign stops.  We expect honesty from an artist, and it would have been nice if at least one song had been about a fight between them or something of that sort.  You can't help but to miss John's emotional honesty and biting humor.  And one other thing: John was a better singer than Linda.
7777	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Sandy Denny was without a doubt one of the greatest female vocalists of all time, but her writing set her apart. This album is one of the best in the writing department, and I disagree completely with another review here that states her voice was going downhill. There is a simplicity in the arrangements that makes sure they don't conflict with the words. The title song is awsome; the rest is classic Denny. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who has any kind of interest in English Folk-Rock. Of course I feel that way about almost anything she did.
God bless them all and may we be blessed with more of their recordings!!!
Pagan Poetry is my favourite- the piercings may be too much for some people, and thanks to the flashes of Bjork's nipples it is  guaranteed that no network music TV will ever touch this footage, so here's your only chance to see it. Bjork looks bleeping amazing in that topless dress, pearls and all, and being wild and fantastic, but this video also makes the song itself come alive. It was not a very memorable track from Vespertine for me, but that changed after I saw the story in motion, so to say.


Being a huge fan of Pink Floyd for a number of years,I very much enjoyed watching this DVD, yet not without some mixed feelings about some of the songs. Overall,the  selection is great: Although Gilmour's voice seemed a bit tired, and not what it used to be,his bluesy playing was excellent. All the guest musicians are some of the best in the business, especially the long term Floyd collaborator Michael Kamen on piano, and the surprising appearances by Rick Wright and Bob Geldof.
The next few are alright, but fizzle until you reach the 'HULK' song, 'Set Me Free', which is a really catchy, power accelerator that keeps you riveted. I can see myself accelerating a bit more, when this track comes along. 'Slither', I didn't care for this song at first, but it grew on me, it really grew on me. I think this sounds a lot like the unreleased STP song that was originally for 'The Crow', but still...who cares and who else would know that? I like this song and the sound is very different, but keeps that STP signature style.

Somehow, the two different styles blend together well and seem to fit in this presentation. The packaging is very detailed. The liner notes are presented in multiple languages besides English and all musicians are credited.  I'm glad I bought it.  But then again, I'm a Zappa nut. :)

A marvelously fluid rhythm section of Pat Donaldson on bass and Gerry Conway on drums.  Near perfect covers of Gordon Lightfoot and Bob Dylan.  Arguably Sandy's most beautiful and evocative song, "The Sea," featuring a breathing, tidelike arrangement that raises the impact of the song to the point that it makes you cry tears of joy.  And of course, Sandy's jawdropping performance of the traditional ballad "The Banks of the Nile," one of the greatest songs against the horror of war that will ever be written.

Editorial reviews are dead-on accurate when they say the film needed narrative for the audience. I'm familiar with the band's tragedies, but several of my friends were not, and the direction provided by Gary Katz (?) left them confused about time periods, time frames, the number of albums produced, those that were not released, and overall confusion about the band. I also cannot believe that there were not anymore live performance available for this feature. There are WAY too many lip-synced performances being shown in this film. There is, however, those truly great pop songs which is the only reason this release rates 4-stars. I'll give the direction 2-stars. Once again Badfinger gets the shaft. If Katz has a bone in his back he will MAKE SURE another cut of this film is released. He should want to for his own reputaton. In closing: Badfinger music = sublime  Gary Katz Direction = Horrible.

4204	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I originally ordered this DVD with a batch of other things from GD Merchandising/GD Almanac.  For years I bought pretty much everything they ever officially released in terms of records, videotapes, CDs, etc. very soon after it was released--seemed like the least I could do . . . . (still try to, but I've fallen a bit behind because of the volume of material released now).  I literally got "Anthem to Beauty"  because I didn't have it and I was faithful about buying everything they officially released.  I really wasn't interested in it when I ordered it.  I always devoted my time to the music -- going to see them, listening to the shows I did have, and finding bootleg copies of shows I didn't have--rather than reading about their history, etc., which seemed like kind of a waste of time compared to listening.  Similarly, I typically find music documentaries and that kind of thing to usually be way below my expectations and often more annoying than anything else.  I don't remember what the description was when I bought it, but I knew it wasn't a live concert and was some kind of documentary.  I was really Ho Hum about it and it sat quite a while before I finally decided to watch it--and I am really glad I did.  I watched it at least 10 more times the first couple of years I had it and several time since.  It is fantastic and there just isn't anything else like it.

Low has to rank among Bowie's most classic releases along with it's successor "Heroes" and its predecessor Station to Station.  "Heroes" is every bit it as good as Low and includes the legendary Robert Fripp on lead guitar.  Over the long history of Bowie's musical career, it is interesting to look back at the quality of musicians with whom he surrounded himself.  He recorded with the enormous talents of Mick Ronson, Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Rick Wakeman, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Earl Slick, Carlos Alomar, John Lennon, Brian Eno, Luther Vabdross and Niles Rogers to name a few.  Also interesting about Low is that it is really the only one of the three Berlin albums without the guitar acrobatics of Robert Fripp or Adrian Belew.  Strangely, the music really holds its own even without them.

The song "Anastasia" starts out with a gentle flamenco style acoustic guitar (think end of double talkin' jive) before kicking into a "Sweet Child O' Mine" riff and changes again and features a great solo from slash as well as Kennedy going from low to high with his vocal. "Bad Rain" has a pure rock swagger about it with its pounding drums and a grooving riff. The first single "You're A Lie" is a good indication of the album with its killer chorus and sleek guitar playing, it shows how much the Slash and Myles Kennedy partnership has grown.

But the greatest performance of all is the final one on the tape, and as Lorna Luft notes: "There's one song that truly belongs only to my mother..." It is, of course, "Over the Rainbow", and its emotional delivery is made all the more poignant by Garland being costumed as a dirty tramp, crying as she sings, reaching for a greater goodness through the song, to triumph over all. That performance of "Over the Rainbow" is the most moving performance of any song that I have ever heard in my life.

The passage of time is the most true test of quality songwriting. There was a ton of similar genre material during this time period which was considered great at that time (even by me), but upon listening to it now I can only think "Wow, how could we actually have thought this was GOOD??"
With Ian Underwood, George Duke and Jean-Luc Ponty in the band the standard of musicianship is also very high. Listen to Fifty Fifty and Camarillo Brillo as examples. Zappa will not be to everybody's taste but this is as a good a way to start as I know.
---Great songs
The moody "Daytime Drama" does a great job of keeping things intense while also shifting gears--it mellows things out a bit, yet still rocks, with an infectious bass line doubled on keyboards and later played on electric guitar. It kinda craps out at the end, unwisely modulating to a major key, but still a heck of a good track overall.
Just about every song on this album is amazing, with the exception of "I'm Goin' Down", which is good, but not as good as the others.

7928	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Notice that in any review of a recording of Mozart's clarinet works, the musicians are always criticized and critiqued, but there is no critic that even attempts to lay a finger on the compositions themselves, except when praising them. That is because, simply put, Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Quintet are perfect. The Concerto, Mozart's most mature finished work (it was the last major composition that he completed before his death; the Requiem Mass was, of course, never finished), is absolutely sublime in its beautiful, lyrical phrasing and its use of the clarinet's full range. Every theme is fleshed out and expanded upon to its fullest, with a gorgeous, transcendent effect. The Quintet, composed several years earlier, sounds very similar to the concerto in many respects. The great Mozart scholar Alfred Einstein writes, "one almost has the impression that Mozart felt impelled to express again [in the concerto], in greater and dramatically animated form, what he had already expressed in more lyric form... in the Quintet." And lyric the quintet is; the strings and the clarinet play off of each other perfectly throughout, creating a harmonious blend of beautiful sound. Unlike other later clarinet works, such as those by C.M. Weber (I also highly recommend Shifrin's rendition of these), which dazzle with their huge dramatic sound and prolonged technical passages, these Mozart pieces are beautiful because of their simple and heartwarming nature.
The most amusing thing I saw in this video was the very first scenes - Metallica fans lined up outside music stores just before the official midnight release of the "Black Album", and stacks of Metallica CASSETTES and CD's in CARDBOARD LONGBOXES sitting next to the cash registers.  That along with the decidedly 80's hairstyles and fashions let you know that you're definitely not watching anything from the post-hair metal era in music (that would occur only a few short months after this footage was shot - when Nirvana would come along and change the rules about everything).

9728	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	As Bowie's Thin White Duke persona ran ragged with both fascist sympathies and cocaine addiction, Bowie decided to cool it down, left Britain and L.A. behind and went to Berlin with friend Iggy Pop to try yet another creative direction. This album, Low, was the beginning of a fruitful effort with Brian Eno and possibly the best and most creative phase in his career. Side one is Bowie stepping into Eno's aural terrain, creating a kind of mutant pop that would foreshadow the New Wave music of the 80s. Side two is largely instrumental and this is where Bowie tries on Eno's ambient style for size, like yet another Bowie persona, yet the world-weariness and depressing air comes from someplace much more profound than yet another Bowie costume change. This was the first Bowie album I bought and coupled with "Heroes" makes for a very distinct period of Bowie's long and mostly productive career. The cover photo hearkens to his film "The Man who Fell to Earth" and there is a definite alienated quality to this record. The track "Always Crashing in the Same Car" seems to find Bowie in a real reflective and contemplative mood and this record can put the listener right there.
Had Tool stuck to the no-nonsence format of their debut we may have had a good album.

I'm glad they took their time and engineered this to play on 5-1 surround sound...I finally got to confirm that the birds I was hearing at the '95 concert weren't birds in the stadium! :-)) I always told people that it sounded like birds were flying around the stadium during "Division Bell!"

Selling out would have been if Will were to incorporate superficious gangsta, thug, or pimp elements into his music. He didn't.

Christmas Eve & Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level - a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill, a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature, radio friendly metal, operatic vocals & well-known classical/traditional songs given a metal twist. The jury has remained out, despite numerous albums later both holiday themed & not, on what exactly TSO is. Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show & radio friendly tunes true metal, while purist classical fans cry sacriledge ... albeit, honestly, it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent. As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest & what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for, from children to grandparents, creating something for everyone ... even the purists if they give it a chance.

Ginger Baker shows that you don't have to be fancy to be great; the "less is more" philosophy is evident on "Sitting on Top of the World"-just enough for the feel of the track without overpowering it. Some bizarre name tracks on the studio offerings but if you can preview them first with an open mind and you may be surprised at how some may start appealing to you (Pressed Rat and Warthog, As You Said). This also kind of foreshadows what happens to groups when they put out a double album--it seems to show them at their peak and most times the offerings that follow just don't seem to have the same energy and appeal. The live tracks show the raw talent of each member without any tricks or gimmicks-just great musicianship.

Oh, and F.Y.I., Yanni never took a piano lesson. He doesn't read standard sheet music, but DOES have a unique style of writing his music down that only HE truly understands (it's a combination of Greek and weird symbols.) He's also gifted with Perfect Pitch which is the ability to identify musical notes upon hearing them. Therefore, he can listen to the works of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin, et al and play them back with impeccable accuracy without seeing "note-one" on paper. Fortunately for us, unlike fine wines, genius doesn't need to age to be enjoyed!
"Diamond Dogs" is a timeless album. An outstanding album. . . an ineffable one, perhaps? Well, if it were ineffable, should I have said so much on its behalf? Why yes, for it is the creation of David Bowie, and we should at least attempt to put its beauty and power into words. . . Yet no words seem to give it true justice. Give a listen, you'll see what I mean. . . Orwell would/should certainly be proud of Bowie for having transformed his words and his ideology into such magnificent music.

4855	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have been a fan of Yes since I first heard the "Tormato" album in 1978, but there has never been a full-length concert video of the band,...until now! "The House of Yes" is beautifully recorded, both in terms of the clear, well-mixed audio, and the bright, colorful visual presentation (although I'm not sure why the concert is presented in the widescreen "letterbox" format). This also the only "official" live Yes recording to feature Yes' late 90's six man line-up with guitarist/vocalist Billy Sherwood, and ol' Billy gets in some good moments here, especially on the newer tracks "Face To Face", "The Messenger", and "Lightening Strikes". The bands newest keyboardist Igor Khoroshev also makes a great showing for himself, and manages to steal the spotlight in many places! The set list really represents the overall history of Yes quite well, with a mix of classic 70's showpeices ("Yours Is No Disgrace", "And You and I", "Perpertual Change"), early 80's rockers ("Cinema", "Owner of a Lonely Heart") and a healthy dose of energetic material from 1999's "The Ladder" (including the great prog epic "Homeworld"). The only major disappointment is an extremely edited-down version of the Yes classic "Roundabout", which excludes the the acoustic intro, middle verses ("out on the drifting clouds/the eagle searching down on the land"), and even parts of the instrumental break...one must wonder why they even bothered to play the song at all! But some of the many highpoints, like an emotionally dramatic performance of the majestic epic "Awaken", go a long way towards making up for this disappointment. If you are a Yes fan, old or new, then this is certainly one for your collection!

Her music has changed significantly through the years so fans of her more recent albums may not like her early work.

And even as a piece of fictional filmaking, it's just not that good. As others have noted, the period clips of Pistols and solo Sid Vicious performances are the only redeeming feature. But the "story" as such is lacking in so many ways; the acting and script are hilariously bad and the film transfer is simply atrocious.

7379	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In the wake of his highly successful Big Picture album, and live album, Michael W. Smith came back with a bang, releasing I 2 (Eye), in my humble opinion, his finest work.  Though the arrangements are pure 80's, with plenty of synthesizer, the music is timeless.  Michael is at his most intimate here; singing about losing faith, child death, leaving familiar environs and approaching the very throne of God.  His music goes from the rockin' "Secret Ambition" to the soothing strings of "I Miss the Way".  One notable song, "The Other Side" briefly spotlights Smitty's abilities as a pianist, which makes me wish he would have more piano solos in his music as opposed to conceding to guitar as he often does.  "Ashton" until Freedom came out is Michael's best instrumental.  Inspired by Frank Peretti's This Present Darkness, it takes it's time in development and unleashes a driving synthesizer piece that reflects the supernatural battles that take place in the book.

Enjoy!
Kool Mo Dee is known as the prelude to Rakim, in that he raised the bar lyrically and how he rhymed every sentence. And this is the work he did after Rakim & a few others had advanced the Hiphop art. Kool Mo Dee's vocabulary is vast, maybe the best I've ever heard in a rapper. He still uses his old-old school style of shouting over flowing, but I think he sped it up a little in this album to adjust with the times. His voice sounds a lot like Ced-Gee's from the Ultramagnetic MC's, or it should be said the other way around based on KMD's legacy. The musical backgrounds usually hit pretty hard, and have aged well, and there were even some rock elements included in a couple of the songs.
All Is Full Of Love is one of the best videos you will ever see, though I find it very disturbing. The clash of cold, surgical machine world and the powerfullly emotional music and gestures gave me a real pause.

Ram spawned a #1 single in North America - the complex, multi-part character sketch Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey - and for that at least it secured itself a place in the annals of pop music. But there's much more to it than that. These songs are the oddball, eccentric work of a true genius and this record has survived the years to reveal itself as the masterpiece it always was.
For the most part, the Country Gentlemen kept things fairly traditional. Even when they covered more contemporary material (Dylan's "Girl from the North Country," Gordon Lightfoot's "Redwood Hill," Graham Nash's "Teach Your Children"), it really wasn't much of a stretch to treat these songs as bluegrass numbers. It is worth noting, however, that the two Sugar Hill numbers have the Country Gentlemen updating their sound by adding a drummer.
8182	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Although Sweet hasn't been able to duplicate the feat, for at least one disc he reached the heights of pop God. This, his third album, brings to mind the lightning-in-a-bottle qualities of Big Star's first two LPs, and retains the same sort of charm and freshness over the years since its release.  Though his subsequent releases have shown flashes of this brilliance, it's Girlfriend that packed all of the goods into one, incredible album. His songs are perfectly fleshed out, with production that can be tough or sweet, but never lose their edge.  His singing comes from some place spiritual. His joys and heartbreaks, his sense of sublime, are as palpable as your own.  As he subsequently gave himself into more 70s excess, his music lost the compactness and focus that makes Girlfriend such a repeatable listen. But then, how many people ever write and perform even one song (let alone a whole album) this great?  Very few - though the list certainly includes Matthew Sweet.

His work on "Big Love" is so amazing, I find it hard to believe the music is coming from only one guitar. Stevie and Christine have lost absolutely nothing as far as their vocal abilities.  Their singing is as smooth and capturing as ever.  And as for Mick's drum playing, well let's just say the video speaks for itself.  This man beats the heck out of those skins and shows the fun and enthusiasm he is having while doing it.  John stays in the background and provides the pulsating bass that the music is renowned for.  An enjoyable performance from every aspect.  My one complaint is that this is not a blu-ray and the picture is a bit blurry and distracting at times.

All sound magnificent, and to top that off, the  price is an excellent value.  Thus, if one likes to refer to themselves as  a true oldies' fan, this collection of hits by one of the greatest and most  versatile rock n'roll singers ever should not be passed up.

The actual "All is Full of Love" video, resplendent with its German industrial visuals, stunning computer graphics and erotic overtones, is perhaps not the strongest of Bjrk's videos, but even the worst Bjrk videos trump 99.9% of the dreck currently perforating American culture.  On its own, the video is a triumph, and validates purchase of the disc by itself.  Perhaps some will be irked by the percussion-laden remix of the song used in the video (as opposed to the stripped-down, ethereal, percussionless version found on _Homogenic_), but the remix works with the theme of the video much better than the album version would have.
The albums full of great songs, and it's not that I'm looking for great lyrical depth in McCartney on this album. I'm just enjoying what he comes up with when he isn't trying to please 10 million consumers. Songs like 'Eat At Home' are so ''quaint'' they border on 'corny', if not jumping that fence entirely, but the song is so 'stay in your head' it's too good to really quibble about why it needed to be a song. 'Back Seat of My Car' is brilliant, as is 'Long Haired Lady'. 'Too Many People' has long been my favourite from this album.
 Now for the cd- For most people they think of  Blondie crossing the genre  bounderies and for this cd it is no exception. The cd begins with D-Day- an in your face punk/dance tune. Flawless vocals- aggressive. The next two tracks are the pure pop/new wave part of the cd- the What I Heard which should have been a hit by now and the actual first single Mother which is made even better with the Zombiefied video. Pure Blondie. The End The End is my favorite track on the cd. Experimental keyboards flitter about as Debbie sings of finding lasting love. Girlie Girlie is a remake of the UK top 10 reggae hit- it was part of the Parallel Lines UK newspaper special last year so it has been up on You Tube so most have hear that by now. Love Doesn't Frighten Me At All is pure perfection from Matt and his wife as the songwriters . It is also the most Blondie track on the cd. A shiny perfect tune with Debbie's heart on the sleeve vocals. Words In My Mouth (which Debbie wrote for Shriley Manson- is a slower tune that reminds me of Can I Find The Right Words To Say off The Hunter- very inward about stating your case in a relationship and be damned if it makes it better or worse. Sunday Smile- is a remake of the Beruit track and as usual Debbie makes another person's song all her own. It is a bit odd at first but it has grown on me. The Trumpet playing of Zach Condon from the original group adds so much emotion to the song- it is a slower moodier track. Wipe Off My Sweat is a SPANISH language vocal dance track- the only flat out dance track on the cd. It works- no idea what is being said outside of Papi Papi Beso Me- Daddy Daddy Kiss me- but Debbie in any language is 100% better than most singers. Le Bleu- French language- again not sure but sounds very cool with the accordian working the Frenchness out. The last of the regular tracks- China Shoes - to me another highlight because the guitar work is very similiar to Shayla and that is my all time favorite Blondie track. Strange lyrics that seem to work perfectly - just a very pretty vocal from Debbie and one of the two tracks written by Debbie and Chris so that makes it even more special. The Bonus tracks- Horizontal Twist- with Chris' wife and kids on back up- to me is part 2 of You're Too Hot and is one of the better later tracks. Such a great track. Sheryl Crow should be proud to be name checked on the track. Mira Me - another (even more) Spanish Language track- well the only song that is not 100% the best- it does sound like the vocals are messed with - but again it is Debbie Harry and it too will grow on more listens.

5. Wasted Time [Reprise] - 4.5
That is followed by more quotes from William Shakespeare.  Hamlet: "To be or not to be, that is the question."  That famous passage segues into the song "It Was A Very Good Year."  Even though the song is more spoken than sung, William Shatner wrings emotion from the lyrics that the great Frank Sinatra could only hint at.  Frankly, William Shatner turns in the definitive version of that song.
Here's the thing, though. "Smash Your Head Against the Wall"--an album not high on anyone's radar, I'd think--has had *two previous CD iterations*. That's a lot for a solo album from The Who's bassist, right? Consequently, this 2005 Castle release needs to deliver something new, or it has little reason to exist. And it delivers...somewhat.
Creed was famous for releasing incredibly accessible songs, with albums where any song that wasn't released as a single was practically unlistenable to any Creed fans in the first place - this is why Velvet Revolver is the new Creed, they're doing the same thing - relying on a few songs, & their name to sell records...

The result was one of the finest combinations of great music and showmanship to ever grace a stage. I've read reviews of the CD and there are some who make comments to the effect of "Well, I guess you had to be there". To those I say buy this VHS, see it on a good set with good speakers.

9764	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This collection of songs is a wonderful part of a 3-album period of brilliance for David Bowie.  Each song is very unique and the album sets the listener on a journey of discovery.  I was young when the outstanding "Low" was released.  I wore the vinyl LP out from playing it so often.  Amazing, but the CD sounds new and fresh after 30 years!!  All of us who treasure great modern music also treasure Mr. Bowie.  He's a great artist who drove himself hard to be truly original.  This album is one of the half-dozen best of his work to this point.  David, we love you......keep up the superb work!!

Visually you couldn't ask for more eye candy. The lasers are on par with the likes of Jean Michelle Jarre. And as for the liquid slide projections....WOW!. The only visual treat the video CAN'T do justice to is the giant mirrorball used in Comfortably Numb's final solo. You really have to see this in real life to truly appreciate it. But it still looks pretty impressive on here.
McCartney's vocals are flat out amazing. The sillyness that would become annoying in later years is still charming at this point. Paul's sense of melody is probably unmatched in popular music in the later part of the 20th century, and he can rock with the best of them when he is in the mood.

But I don't care. It might be a bit more commercialized than some of us would like but it's still a great, great album. In a time when people are listening to Avril Lavigne and lip-synchers like Lindsay Lohan (she's a singer now just because she's made a few movies?) and Hilary Duff (ditto) it's refreshing to find a band that still knows how to make some great rock music. They're bringing the `80s back - I really thought Duff would have gotten a haircut by now.

Thank goodness Toni Iommi got back together with Tony Martin and created this masterful work, a return to Toni's heavy riff writing.  Just the first three songs "I witness", "cross of thorns" and "Psychopobia" make the album, but the rest is bonus.  A great album.  Virtual death is good, and evil eye to end the album.  I own the japanese import version with the bonus track "what's the use", and that song should have been released stateside...just absolutely rocks.

Well worth  the purchase - it may not be available for very long, so get it while it's  still around.
Justin Chancellor's bass is interesting in areas, though nothing that really grabbed my attention.  If it counts for anything, at least his bass is more audible in this album than most rock albums out there.
13. Loving The Alien-My second favorite ballad on the cd, even though it is quite mellow, it is such a good song, Scott sounds so great on this song. 10 of 10.
"AEnima" - A prayer for the Apocalypse. Probably the best (and angriest) song on the album.
Shine On
For the performance, Manze shows uneven articulation and wavering intonation that is not enjoyable to listen to. Also, there is a lack of what I would call buoyancy to the Manze recording. Schroder has a command of the music with solid intonation combined with smooth articulation. Schroder's fast movements are buoyant and soaring when needed. While listening to the slow movement of the Schroder recording, I was lulled into ecstasy. Manze, on the other hand takes the slow movement too slow and his tone is uneven during long notes. In one instance he reaches a high note and there is a definite slide up into the note that is very irritating.
4527	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Art Garfunkel's solo career is hopefully getting the long overdue recognition it deserves - several of his solo records are easily on par with his longtime partner, Paul Simon, and his body of work ranges across some of the finest American songwriters: Jimmy Webb, Stephen Bishop, and, of course, Simon himself.  This beautifully produced DVD at Ellis Island is a concert from 1996 and it is both incredibly moving and heartbreaking to see images of the former World Trade Center juxtaposed with the Statue of Liberty in a brief montage that bridges two of Garfunkel's finest musical moments: "All I Know," by Webb, and "Bright Eyes" from the movie, "Watership Down."  James Taylor and Garfunkel even sing a duet, "Cryin' the Rain" with the Trade Center directly behind them. This is a concert for people who love New York City and all it represents. Garfunkel singing at Ellis Island and relating his own family history only adds to the poignant and powerful concert that follows.  Many of his classics with Simon are here - a pitch perfect "Bridge over Troubled Water" and an ending song, "Grateful," that could not be better played or sung.  Another treat: Garfunkel's then small son singing "Feelin' Groovy" along with him and his beautiful wife, who sings backup on several songs. There's not a false note here - for Garfunkel fans, and fans of good music, it's all here.  A five star treat!

The good thing about Tools music is that it opens up your eyes for what music can be. Tools songs aren't just usual songs. They take detours in sound, build ups and stop start thrashes of guitars.

"D.J." gives way to one of my favorite Bowie  songs,  "Look Back in Anger."  "Look Back" is musically upbeat but  lyrically foreboding. I'm not exactly sure what the song is about, but it  seems menacing.  Oblique Bowie is usually Bowie at his best.  The next song  is "Boys Keep Swinging," which is fun and also clever.  The song's  cleverness is that it may not be as straightforward as it seems at first.  The title suggests a return to Bowie's earlier homo-erotic toying, but the  words don't necessarily convey any such meaning.  Instead, the song seems  to be an over-the-top joke about life as a male.  The humor value would be  greater still if Bowie's serious!  I can't hear the song without thinking  also of Bowie's groundbreaking video for it, in which he convincingly  portrays his own (female) backup singers.

Seems Bossy (the cow) somehow ate up all of Metamorpho's food supply and I had to walk 30 miles to the nearest food store. (Magic Seer's carpet was in for repair), So I set out and realized that I had left my fur-lined Seer's cape at home when a snow storm surprised me on the way. Luckily, a man in an old Dodge pick-up truck picked me up and gave me a ride. Amazingly, he recognized me and, for the price of an autographed picture, gave me a return trip! What luck! But, I suppose for being spiritual (and a friend of the Universe), one is entitled to such perks. Nevermind all that. Cream's EXCELLENT "Wheels of Fire" awaits us all.
White Room, a big hit for Cream in 1968 is orchestral cum wah-wah mysterious with a spacious sound with vocals by turns ethereal and menacing. It rocks on, I want to say. It was backed on the 45 by Pressed Rat and Warthog (I think), one of Ginger Baker's goof-poetry ditties that always was a favorite of mine. The balance of the songs are amazing. "As You Said", a string piece featuring Jack Bruce on cello and vocal is singular -  nothing like it I'm aware of. It has always perplexed, amazed and pleased me when I hear it. The arrangement is super-fine. Deserted Cities of the Heart is a great, underrated track that boils along feverishly. Those Were the Days is an outstanding pop song whose lyrics typify my feelings about That Time (1968)- pure nostalgia written nostalgically at the time. Politician and Sitting On Top of the World are major Cream cuts which most people know. They are essential, bluesy rock classics.

Ram is an excellent album but, to me, it's his third best after Band on the Run & Back to the Egg. The hit from this album is "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". The best song on the album, though, is "Smile Away" which is one of Sir Paul's rockingest (if that's a word) songs. The album has two bonus tracks that include "Another Day" (which Lennon called just another song) & "Oh Woman, Oh Why", a B-side to "Another Day" but one of his stronger songs. "Oh Woman, Oh Why" isn't available elsewhere. Another good song here is "Eat at Home".
Music that defies definition except that it's just perfect: Steely Dan.  Very, very highly recommended; in fact get all their albums but get the remastered versions.  Pop/rock music has hardly been better than when it's in the hands of Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famers, Steely Dan.

What makes the album work as a whole comprises of two elements... The 'Recording/mixing' and the overall 'arrangements' of the songs. Each track has a totally different feel from the next, and it keeps you on the edge waiting for what is next. The arraingements are all excellent as well. McCartneys vocal stylings have a lot to do with the diversity of the album. His stylings ranged from singing folky, to hard rock, to classical, to comical.. He's all over the place.
For those who are all hating on Tool, I have one thing to say: Nobody cares. Sure, I wrote this review in response, but I could careless about what you have to say. You obviously don't know the true heart of Tool or know anything about them, and are just trying to justify your pathetic lives by ripping on such an influential band.

For me Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band's 6th studio offering, "Born In The U.S.A.",  has gone from classic album to an album I could hardly play, back to classic.  That's because in '84 when released every song was just great, but radio and the record  company (Columbia) got involved and released 7 singles, it got pretty damn tiring.  So around 1986 I quit listening to "BITUSA", around 2000 I started to enjoy this again, after not hearing these songs on the radio 24/7.  On Bruce's last tour in 2009, me and my brother were heading to Kansas City from St. Louis (in which he performed "Born To Run", that night), he was going to perform the "Born In The U.S.A." that night, we were pumped, until somebody came into one of the restaurants across from the Sprint Center and said "The concert's cancelled, somebody died".  We came to find out it was his cousin Lenny Sullivan (36) who  passed away that afternoon in his hotel room.  Well let's get back to this great album, Nils Lofgren had just joined the band.  We start out with, the title track #8 MSR, #9 hot 100, a vibrant piece of work, the blow torch "Cover Me", #3 MSR, #7 Hot 100, "Darlington County", could of come off "The River", good rocker, Danny and Roy at their best.  "Working On The Highway", a pumping rocker, "Downbound Train", a great story song, a Springsteen classic, "I'm On Fire", #6 hot 100, #4 MSR and #6 AC, sexy track, the rolling "No Surrender", #40 MSR, the 50's sounding "Bobby Jean", the down's of "I'm Going Down", #9 MSR and #9 hot 100, the classic Springsteen of "Glory Days", #5 hot 100 and #3 MSR, nice mandolin work by Little Steve here.  The 80's sounding, concert favorite "Dancing In The Dark" #2 hot 100 and #7 Dance, and the beautiful folk-rock of "My Hometown", #6 hot 100, #1 AC and #6 MSR.  Bruce disbanded the E-Street Band in 1986, but got them back together in 1999 and released their first album in 17 years  in "The Rising".
What a flawless performance of material that in some cases was decades old.
The closing song, Bebop Tango (Of The Old Jazzmen's Church) is probably the best peek into the feel of a Zappa gig, where the audience plays such a big role in the show.

The same can be said about Judy Garland's "Come Rain Or Come Shine".  Diane cooks this one to the max!  Look out for Diane's funky vocal on "Louisiana Sunday Afternoon".  And that saxophone!

The "House of Yes" DVD finds this incarnation of the band in fine form and it is a pleasure to find new material time and again from YES.

If you like YES then add this to your list of wants. I detract one star from my review due to the fact that I was very excited at the prospect of watching a new performance of "Time and A Word", one of my favorite YES songs.

Last Friday, I stopped by J&R here in NYC to pick up a copy of Pulse, the latest dvd from Pink Floyd. I couldn't find it in the Floyd section of the music bin, so I asked for help.

The one thing that did seem a bit odd and non-period were some polyphonic embellishments to the basic plainchant. Undoubtedly beautiful, I was a bit taken aback by the idea of these additions to the original works from anonymous sources (as well as to the addition of vocal drones to some of Hildegard's pieces). The liner notes do a good job of justifying the polyphony, saying that this particular form, known sometimes as "archaic organum", was in common use in the German-speaking world in medieval times. The embellishments sound great but at times I did feel they may have been taking the music another 100 years or so beyond its date of composition.

The most controversial aspect of the DVD is the excision of a number of songs.  I wonder about this.  Perhaps another reviewer can expand upon this, but I wonder about whether there is actually footage for every song in the concert.  Perhaps there is, but it is also quite possible that we lack footage (or usable footage) for a number of tracks for which we possess soundtracks.  If so, this would not be the first concert film for which this would be true.  Just because we possess a soundtrack, we mustn't assume that we possess film.  Now, having said this, I will add that it is possible that such footage exists, and they merely decided not to include it, and if so, that is greatly to be lamented.  Nonetheless, I do not regard this as a fatal flaw, and it certainly didn't lessen my enjoyment of the music that we have.

The opening song "Late November" was actually intended for a second Fotheringay album, that was never finished. Fotheringay did record the song and that version is included among the bonus-tracks.

The simple, hard truth is that VR are nowhere close to their predecessors, in every department. Nonetheless this is an above average album, well worth 15 dollars. I recommend it if you want a decent rock album, but don't expect it to be the latest STP or GnR album.
"Lady Writer" - I found the "Puffy Shirt" from Seinfeld! Well, maybe not exactly, but you have got to see the shirt that poor Pick Withers has to endure back at the drum kit (it really does look like its "Puffy Shirt" namesake). Very lame production values from the late 1970s, once again.

But, the goodness doesn't stop there. There are lots of great songs here, such as "Eulogy", "H", "Third Eye", "Jimmy"...well, pretty much the whole thing.

And, of course, the annoying piece of hair fluttering around inside one of the three film cameras(during the last two songs) remains present with no attempt to retouch it, though certainly there are things that could have been done in the digital domain to retouch the image(techniques that were used on the DVD of "The Who-The Kids Are Alright")

There's just one unforgivable omission here, the great song Red Light Spells Danger that was a huge hit for Ocean in the mid seventies. No collection could be considered complete without that masterpiece.
4. Another Woman (Too Many People)
The live disc is a bit of a disappointment.  As with the studio disc, it opens with the best track, the quintessential recording of Robert Johnson's 'Crossroads'.  It's the only track featuring Eric Clapton on vocals, but it's Slowhand's churning guitar that propels the song into rock and roll heaven.  Willie Dixon's 'Spoonful', at nearly seventeen minutes, lacks the melodic structure to maintain interest over that much time, as most blues numbers would.  Maybe you "had to be there" to truly appreciate it.  'Traintime' is a harmonica-based, Jack Bruce blues number, not bad but not exceptional either, and 'Toad' is a Ginger Baker composition that sets the drummer's considerable talents front stage and center, but at over sixteen minutes is overdone as well.  The two extended tracks, 'Spoonful' and 'Toad', first appeared on 'Fresh Cream', the band's debut album.

5668	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	This is one of Sir Paul's weakest albums, in fact, of his 70's albums only Red Rose Speedway & Wildlife are weaker. The CD includes the hit "Let 'Em In" which is one of his WORST songs. I would bet that at sometime John Lennon swore that McCartney would write a song about someone knocking on the door! The CD also has the hit "Silly Love Songs" which might be schmaltzy but is a good song nonetheless. It contains one of his greatest bass lines. Of the remaining songs I'm impressed with "Beware My Love" & "Wino Junko". The latter song was composed by his lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch who also does the lead vocal.
Part of me- one of my favorites on the EP... 6/5.

Overall, I love it, and highly recommend it.
With all of Samantha's 80s albums getting the reissue treatment, Wounded Birds did a great job with this hugely successful sophomore album--both in sound quality and track selection. The full album is presented intact, and the six bonus tracks are all the right ones--the full 12" mixes of all the singles, including Naughty Girls, the Stock Aitken Waterman produced Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now, and I Surrender (to the spirit of the night), a fantastic dance rock track that was actually the b-side to Naughty Girls way back when. You also get the b-side "Even the Darkest Hours", the "new mix" of True Devotion, and the hot house track "All I Wanna Do", which was actually a track from a Full Force album that Samantha joined them on, so it's a treat to have it included on her album as well. It would have been even better to have the 12" version instead of the single mix, but the CD is already full packed, using all but 20 seconds of its eighty minutes!
4962	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Not quite what I was expecting from Anne Murray, but okay.  There is a somewhat odd song selection and flow to the song arrangement and often, Anne's voice isn't used to it's best advantage.  Her voice may not be what it used to be, which is understandable, but on this CD, it seems unusually strained and harsh, which makes it a little hard to listen to.  I do listen to this occasionally.  I love Anne Murray, but I'm not sure I'd buy this CD again...
The best part of this DVD?  The special features.  The 5-6 extra songs included are the best ones on the DVD!
The video  itself is far superior to Lord of the Dance in that the constant cut-aways  and angle changes have been largely done away with.  The production quality  is superb and the music breathtaking, particularly in surround sound or  with a sub-woofer.

Another piece of trivia unique to this album is that it contains two of the songs that were allegedly part of the "Beatles Feud". Those being TOO MANY PEOPLE and DEAR BOY which John Lennon thought were directed at him. Paul of course denies ever doing such a thing and it's hard to tell what the truth is, but I would venture to say that it is a strong possibility. They were specifically implying that Yoko was in love with Paul before John and that Paul sent her away (Ouch!). After John's tragic death it is probably in bad taste for me to even mention this, but it is a historical aspect of this album that is undeniable and significant in its allure.
As a whole this is a strong recording, but I prefer the badly  underatted and greatly diversifed, On The Border album where styles galore  are explored.  None the less this is a 4 1/2 star album that should belong  in most comprehensive music collections.
The show begins with Frank greeting his guests (ncluding Lucille Ball, Sammy Davis Jr. and Fred Astaire), smiling, lost in the magic of the ocassion. He then launches into a passionate rendition of "You Will Be My Music" that gets a wonderful reception.

He does achieve it, in spades.  Evidently, that's not what critics were looking for in the summer of '71, and they all took their best shots at the album.  Too bad, because it was their loss.  The LP was full of extremely inventive fun, and that was what I needed in the summer of '71, and still need today.  If you are new to Paul McCartney, this is the best place to start, and if you are an old fan, do yourself a favor and put this on again.  I love albums where I can simultaneously reminisce and appreciate the present moment, because the music is so good.

7225	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is $hort Dog's best album, without doubt.  All his albums are classic, but this one sits on the top.  This is old skool rap at its best, with the beats and his lyrics at top notch. My favorite songs are CussWords, I Ain't Trippin', Pimp The Ho, and Don't Fight The Feelin'.  CussWords goes for almost 8 minutes and not at one point in the song do u get sick of it!  Amazing lyrics and the beat is just off the chain.  I Ain't Trippin' has one of my favorite beats, just classic.  This album is just completely dope, and proves he is the REAL PIMP!  Not these wanna-be fakers such as 50 CENT.  50 cent aint no pimp, but its obvious his idol was $hort Dog.  Get this album if u haven't already, and if u into modern commercial crap, then u should pick this up too, and see who the real pimp is.
People are always asking me how they can be as hip and cool as I am - well, not really; if someone ever does ask me, though, I might very well point them to this album.  With lyrics such as "back in the day the girlies turned me down like collars - yeah but now you're poppin' like Orville Redenbacher," this is as smooth and happening an album as you will find from the early 1990s.
Quick synopsis of the title track:  A guy driving in the desert finds a place to spend the night.  He's not sure where he is("This could be heaven or...hell," Don Henley sings).  He gets a warm greeting from his hosts("Welcome to the Hotel California") and orders wine, only to be told, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969."  In the end, our hero discovers that Hotel California is not what he thinks it is and tries to escape, but the night clerk tells him, "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."  And then Don Felder and Joe Walsh chime in with their dueling lead guitars.  "Hotel California" to this day remains a classic, with its great story and awesome musicianship.  "New Kid In Town", the other #1 hit off this album, is a throwback to the Eagles' early country-rock days, with Glenn Frey singing lead and Don Felder's lead guitar sounding a little mellower than it does on "Hotel California".  "Life In The Fast Lane", Hotel California's third hit song and the only Eagles hit song featuring Joe Walsh as a co-writer, is self-explanatory.  "Life In The Fast Lane", with Joe getting in some great guitar licks, is a perfect description of the fast-paced, drug-and-booze-laced Southern California lifestyle:  "They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills" and "Life in the fast lane surely makes you lose your mind," sings Don Henley.  "Wasted Time" is a tender ballad about lost love, life on the street, and the passage of time.  The "Wasted Time" reprise leads into "Victim Of Love", another rocker featuring Joe's terrific lead guitar work.  Joe, whose biggest non-Eagles hits--"Funk #49", "Rocky Mountain Way", "Walk Away", "Life's Been Good", and "All Night Long"--were all rockers, contributes a great ballad, "Pretty Maids All In A Row", to Hotel California.  Randy Meisner's career as an Eagle ended with this album; he left the Eagles in '77, a year after Hotel California's original release.  Randy's contribution to the record, "Try And Love Again", doesn't quite match up to his best Eagles songs:  "Certain Kind Of Fool", "Too Many Hands" and the hit "Take It To The Limit".  Still, it's a pretty solid number.  "The Last Resort" tells about the massive migration to Southern California in the '50s and '60s, and Don Henley even gets in a jab at the religious hypocrisy he saw going on:  "You can see them there on Sunday morning/Stand up and sing about what it's like up there/They called it paradise and I don't know why/You call someplace paradise/Kiss it goodbye."

235	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	First of all, let's be honest here.  There can be no denying that this documentary is a great tribute to Gil Scott-Heron's words and music, but it is clearly not for everybody.  Gil Scott-Heron, while having a legion of loyal fans, has never been a mainstream artist.  His first significant national exposure was probably through his appearance as a musical guest on "Saturday Night Live," when Richard Pryor hosted the show during the end of 1975. On that episode, he performed "Johannesburg" (which he also performs in this documentary).  However, Gil Scott-Heron could not get arrested on the show today, which now showcases primarily mainstream artists like Ricky Martin.  This does not in anyway diminish Scott-Heron's talent or influence as an artist -- if anything it boosts it.  This is particularly true in the wake of this documentary's release on homevideo.
This album was a favorite of an old girlfriend of mine. When I picked her up and she threw this album into the tape deck, I knew I was in for the kind of night I wanted. The album would start off with `Surrender to the Spirit of the Night' to get us in the mood. By the time we got to the beach we were making out to `Naughty Girls need Love too'. We would be going all the way by the time her Rolling Stones cover of `Satisfaction' came on. God Bless Samantha Fox, she was one of the thousands of reasons the 80's ruled.

9586	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	How anybody could try to refute the quality of an opening track like "Love for Tender" is beyond me... that said, "Get Happy" just gets better from there. With more than thirty tracks I'm  surprised that there aren't more more throwaways, but when Elvis couples  his tricky lyrics and guitar with the equally thoughtful instrumental work  of his Attractions you get some real prizes: the bouncy, understated  instrumentation of "Opportunity" that segues straight into the  break-neck ska-ish "Imposter," "Riot Act"'s dynamic  plaintive-turns-to-commanding shift of tone, and my current favorite  "Black and White World." And that's just the regular track  list... then you get eleven more "extended play" gems, ranging  from the hauntingly personal demo versions of "Black and White  World," "Riot Act," and "Love for Tender" to the  experimental feel of "Hoover Factory" and the church-y  "Clowntime is Over No. 2." For me, this album combines every  positive aspect of the Elvis Costello and The Attractions listening  experience, and is by far my recommendation for where a newcomer to EC  should begin.

Don't get me wrong, this is a Horner album that is worth listen to, especially because the album finishes with 'The Place Where Dreams Come True', a lengthy track that swells with marvel and reflection, with the two melodies I mentioned earlier joined together making us feel touched.

Few Beatle songs compare to the songwriting on this record: "Too Many People," "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey," and "Back Seat of My Car," are epics that capture some of the best songwriting McCartney has ever done - equal to "You Never Give Me Your Money," and "Maybe I'm Amazed." And yet, "Ram" just keeps on giving: "Dear Boy," "Ram On," "Heart of the Country," "Long-Haired Lady," "Eat at Home," and the disturbing "Monkberry Moon Delight." The songs on this record display the very essence of what makes Paul's writing so great: descending guitar riffs, passionate vocals, ("Hey Jude" has absolutely nothing on "Back Seat of My Car.") soul-crushing chord progressions, unforgettable melodies... Paul has never recaptured the muse that led to what he did on this record. "Ram" is the standard by which I measure all of Paul's work and I'm waiting for him to tap into that groove one more time.

Niki Nana (We're One) starts with the native sounds of a didgeridoo. After about half a minute the electric band picks up, a flute plays and the vocalists start. Marvellous song.

The DVD as well as the video contains also "the making of" and this part is really well worth watching because it shows more of the ecstatic reactions of the audience itself and gives you insight in Yannis life. The whole show itself is a pleasure to watch. The fun the members of the band have in performing their music is great to see and gets you in a good mood as well.

In my opinion, the selling track here is the self-titled song of the album. "The Grand Wazoo" is a 13-minute construction in which every band members' tallent is used superbly. The trumpet, guitar, bass, and drums in specific sounded fantastic. The other brass instrumentals, and the woodwinds as well, all were a very fitting and complementary addition to this song. The result is a hugely-improvised, energetic, and unique work of art. Zappa fans were simply amazed. It took more than just tallent to make a creation like this - it took Frank Zappa. Of course, this isn't just fusion. It is Frank Zappa's Fusion. It is a whole new sound, which to this day still hasn't been rivaled.

And yet, ten years on, this sounds not only better than ever, but (to me) like the jewel of what could be called the third phase of Ms. James's recording career, the one that began in 1994 with her first release on Private Music, and continues in her present association with RCA. In this period she has benefited from a kind of support that is no doubt the envy of many less fortunate contemporaries. She has been staggeringly prolific, recording Tin Pan Alley standards (four discs!), rock, blues, the inevitable holiday album, even easy-listening pop. But for all the first-class production values and the admirably broad artistic palette of her many releases, few of them have really "scored." There is no doubting Ms. James's sincere affection for the music of Gershwin, Berlin, Porter, and their like, but three albums of standards with pianist Cedar Walton's jazz combo ('94's MYSTERY LADY, '95's TIME AFTER TIME, and '01's BLUE GARDENIA) demonstrate conclusively that such music does not play to her strengths as an improviser or interpreter (she has more in common as a song stylist with Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington, both of whom could also sound out of place on Tin Pan Alley, than with Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, who thrived there). An attempt at still more of the same, this time in heavily synthesized, "modern" clothing, '99's HEART OF A WOMAN, is not only the worst of her Private albums but one of the worst things I have ever heard from any major artist: unlistenable. LIFE, LOVE AND THE BLUES ('98) and MATRIARCH OF THE BLUES ('00) are more pertinent, but still leave an aftertaste of the generic. They're agreeable yet stubbornly unmemorable attempts at recapturing a classic Etta James formula.

Now as for the tunes themselves, it really is Slash's best work since the original Snakepit. Yeah, better than the last album (which was too diverse for my tastes, though the guitar work was amazing as usual), better than VR, better than Snakepit 2000. And I don't mean just guitar work, I mean the songs themselves are better. Bold statement, I know. My favorite is "Hard & Fast", which I'm actually listening to as I type. Easily the most rockin' song, it feels like Chuck Berry on speed during a pornstar gangbang while driving 100 mph in traffic. I don't know how else to describe it. My least favorite, though I don't hate it by any stretch, is the next track (which I'm now listening to as I type) "Far And Away". The only real ballad on the album, it certainly stands out and is kind of an awkward slowdown from the rest of it. Admittedly, I love the phrasing of the solo, as is the case with basically all these songs. Slash is going out of his way to not only not copy himself too much (I say "too much" because a little here & there is inevitable) but to raise his own personal bar, and it shows. Great riffs, great solos, great songs. That's really all you need to know.

(The movie originally aired on NBC in 1983, but I have no memory of that original broadcast.)

Zappa was a Libertarian, but to suggest that he was a rightist (in the Radical Republican sense) is wrongheaded. He loathed organized religion, censorship, conformity, and Reagan. Not exactly the standard picture of the American rightist. It's true that he hated unions, but in his book he claims that they are necessary. I hasten to add that my political philosophy is derived mostly from the Left, so I'm not engaging in special pleading for Zappa. At any rate, I guess I don't understand why his political views are all that important in appreciating his music. I love Richard Wagner's music, but I'm not an anti-Semite. I love Bob Dylan's music, and I'm certainly not a born-again Christian. I think Zappa saw through a lot of the hypocrisy of many of the rock stars of his day. Many of them claimed left-wing credentials, but went off to live in mansions and stash their fortunes in tax-shelters. At least he had the courage of his convictions.

2. Ozzy's vocals are off key. Just listen to Mr. Crowley, No more tears, Mama im coming home or Bark at the moon, the list goes on. Not saying you cant like his voice, I do admit it is unique, but not mature at all. Also alot of people say he is a genius. A man who bit heads off bats and pigeons, someone who moons people on stage, as well as not knowing any other word except the F word. Thats a legend? I think not. Wake up Ozzy lovers and realize a true musician doesnt do those kinds of things, especially not a legend. Thats also one reason why he gets so much attention, a bit immature wouldnt you say?

6024	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is the perfect title for a Beach Boys retrospective.  These songs are constants of the oldies-radio format, especially during the summer.  All of those sixties-sounding songs (classic, to the point of being nearly cliche) are here:  "Surfin' Safari" "Catch A Wave" "Surfer Girl" "Surfin' U.S.A." "Shut Down" "Little Deuce Coupe" "California Girls" "I Get Around" and so on.  If it was about Waves, Women, or Wheels and it had perfect harmony, it's probably on this album.  And there are just enough songs dealing with semi-adult themes ("In My Room" "Don't Worry Baby" "Girl Don't Tell Me" "When I Grow Up To Be A Man"), that the whole package doesn't get stale.  A couple of omissions are "Surfin'" (recorded before the Beach Boys signed with Capitol) and "Surf City," which Brian Wilson gave to Jan and Dean.  "Barbara Ann" seems like is should have been here, and the version of "Help Me, Rhonda" that's included here is not the hit single we heard on the airwaves.  But considering "Good Vibrations" was added to the CD release, all is forgiven.  True-to-the-core fans of The Beach Boys and Surf music will want to go deeper ("Spirit Of America" is another great compilation for this purpose).  But if you want just the cream of their output, all you really need to buy are "Pet Sounds" and this album.  No matter what you're doing or where you might be, with "Endless Summer," you have the sun, the sand, and the surf (and maybe even a babe)!  Who could ask for more?

2645	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Why is classic rock considered classic? Pop in this video. See John Lennon and Mick Jagger have tea together and philosophize. See John play the blues with Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Mitch Mitchell and rock so hard that  even the musicless shrieks of his bizarre new girlfriend Yoko can't ruin  it. See Marianne Faithfull sing an incredibly dated Dylanesque ditty. See  Jethro Tull & Taj Mahal before anyone knew who they were. See the Who  blow the roof off the tent. And see the Beggar's Banquet-era Stones wrap it  up with 5 or 6 tunes and a big sing-along. This concert was recorded in  1968 when Mick was about 24 or so, Lennon was about 28 and it was finally  released by the Stones camp a few years back. (Thank you, gentlemen.) Even  if you could get the leading musicians of today together - Beck, R.E.M.,  Eddie Vedder, Pumpkins, etc. for a similar hootenany, it would still fall  way, way short.

8555	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album, while not as sophisticated (song wise) as AENIMA and UNDERTOW has some amazing songs on it. Don't buy this expecting an AENIMA or UNDERTOW or even LATERALUS like album, this is early TooL, though still in the stages of developement and not mature yet, still extremely powerful. This along with Aline in Chains's Sap is the best EP ever recorded. It rocks from start to finish. While not as long as later TooL, it leaves you at the edge of your seat. My favorite songs off it are Opiate and Hush. Already on this album TooL was questionning religion and obviously angry. When you'll hear Maynard chanting :"Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now. Open my eyes, blind me with your light now..." you'll be mezmorized. The lives tracks are especially well recorded (Jerk Off and Cold & Ugly). Opiate has it's own sort of dark side, it contains some of the most dreary music ever, which is perfect since it fits like a glove the themes of the album contains. You can't go wrong with TooL, each and every cd or unreleased track is worth owning. This is probably they're most agrrrrressssive album of all often compared to Korn's first. While this was simply a collection of TooL's heaviest songs at the time it's still worth buying but you'll probably enjoy this more if your already a TooL, a good place to start, though not the best.

It includes all the hit singles as well as those excellent album tracks/B  sides Brand New Day and Anyone Here In the Audience.  Some of Hammond's  best work was found hidden on the B sides of singles and this collection  brings them back in glorious digital sound.  Some of the tracks are  poignant (Down By the River), some are ethnic flavored (Everything I Want  To Do), some are melancholy (Half A Million Miles From Home) but all are  incredibly catchy pieces of pop perfection you'll be humming long after  playing this collection.  You can't be an officianado of '70s pop without  this CD.
8369	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Employing dark, violent images and an abstract sonic palette, Tool pummels its listeners with a primal sound as distinct as it is disturbing. With a fixed, fiery glare, vocalist Maynard James Keenan assaults the audience with bone-chilling whispers and blistering hollers of unparalleled hatred and loathing. Behind him, heavy, ominous music swells and gives, building uncomfortable tension that makes your hair stand on end, then releasing that tension in frantic bursts of intensity.
I have great affection and respect for the Imogen of today, but there's something about this first album which is rare, fierce and valuable. If you are a fan of Immi's at all, you really owe it to yourself to have this CD, not just because this is how her whole career began, but because in certain ways this is the strongest, most audacious project she has done to date.
6324	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Often cited as Elton's "progressive" album because of the strings, serious lyrics, and complex arrangements. And, yeah, I guess I can go along with that. It's a lot, well... catchier than anything progressive, though - it's still Elton John, after all. And it's good! Probably my third-favorite EJ record, after Tumbleweed Connection and the self-titled. In my opinion, Elton was at his best between 1970 and 1971. This was before Bernie's lyrics started to get really irritating, before his records became full of grandstanding schlock like a majority of Blue Moves and Caribou, or even a very small part of the still exceptional Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Or maybe it's just because I'm tired of hearing "Bennie and the Jets", good song as it is, on the radio all the time. I'm not sure. Basically, stardom-era Elton good (as in "1972-1975"), pre-stardom-era Elton better. All right, now that the rant's out of the way, on with the show. Totally butt-kickin' album! Especially the first five tracks, or more specifically four of the first five tracks.  Elton got the big hits out of the way as fast as possible, and they rule. "Tiny Dancer" is a wonderful orchestrated piano ballad with a little touch of the country, and "Levon" is just Elton at his best. His vocals are in peak form, Paul Buckmaster's orchestration is complex without overwhelming the song, and Taupin's vague character sketch is much more interesting to me than, say, "All the Young Girls Love Alice". Amazingly, though, the title track is even better. Screw Alice Cooper, this is "horror-rock". Elton's vocals, the strings, the minor-key piano, the guitar riffs, and the lyrics about a madman. Amazingly, the ten-minute version found as a bonus track to Tumbleweed Connection is even better, and this is a hard song to top! And "Indian Sunset" may have regrettably stereotypical lyrics, but the arrangement, structure, and vocals. (Noticing a pattern here? Elton's singing in the early period absolutely rules). In such classy company, "Razor Face" is kind of a trifle, but it's fun. The last four tracks aren't as good as the first five, and one of them (the "Bohemian Rhapsody"-"Hey Jude" hybrid "All the Nasties") is a miss by any standards. But "Goodbye" is a passionate elegy; "Holiday Inn" has whiny lyrics but makes up for it with cool mandolin and strings, and "Rotten Peaches" is a great country tune reminiscent of Tumbleweed Connection. So yeah, get this!

Usually I talk about the songs on a CD in detail.  However, these songs need no one to talk about them.  These songs are that good.  Admittedly, these songs are representative of but a short period in his career, and his latter years, including his work with the Traveling Wilburys, will have to be found in another collection.

262	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I've always enjoyed Tony Bennett's voice when I've heard it, but until I bought this album, I had never owned any Bennett music.  This was a great intoduction.  The choices of standards here are excellent, and ensure that we get to hear Tony singing without any poor material to bring him down.  His backing band, the Ralph Sharon Trio, is wonderful.  The audience is ebullient and keeps the energy high all the way through.  And Tony is in great form despite his age - he hits all the high notes and his interpretation is dead on.  I'm also an Elvis Costello fan, so his duet with Tony on "They Can't Take That Away From Me" was a real kick.  All in all, Tony is about a zillion times more animated, entertaining, and talented than the rest of the dreck MTV puts out.  On the album, Tony says he'd love to come back, and MTV should take him up on that.
To make matters even better, all the songs are dressed up in a sort of Sgt. Pepper-esque production, adding an extra layer to the masterpiece.
Anything can be broken. This includes the MediaMax software that autolaunches on the Velvet Revolver CD. Let's break it down this way: Insert the CD in your computer, up pops a mandatory "MediaMax" box that asks you to accept to their terms and agreements. You do, and they install a file on your PC (including licenses that confirm you've purchased the CD - and allow you to play the music on your PC). You're then taken to a new Velvet Revolver CD menu where you are given the opportunity to: Play music, rip music to hard drive (as read-only, non-editable WMA files), go to band's official website, etc.

9282	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I got this after hearing Maynard on the Deftones' White Pony. At the time, I was looking for stuff not as heavy as Korn, my former favorite band, but not too soft. Well, this is the album I wanted.  There are actually nine songs, not fifteen, on this CD. The others are all filler tracks that make the transitons between songs a lot smoother. The best example of this is hearing a riff on Intermission, and then immediatly hearing the same one on Jimmy. Unlike what the official review says, they do NOT sound the same as one another. Instead, they easily flow into one another to make one gigantic 80 minute song. You really can't pick out favorite songs on this, because they're all good. If I had to choose, though, I'd probably go with the phillosophy, "the longer, the better," and choose the epic Third Eye as my favorite, and the fast, furious Hooker with a P**** as my least favorite. If you want to sample this album by downloading songs, though, I'd recommend H (best example of Adam and Justin's talent at guitar and bass) and 46 & 2 (best example of Danny's talent at the drums). Get this album as soon as possible. If you don't have it, you don't know what you're missing.
9)  Set Me Free - My favorite song on the album.  Driven by a killer riff and a rock-solid chorus.  Fantastic bassline.  This song moves quickly and doesn't back off.  High energy.  Sensible, well-played solo from Slash.  This song just plain works.  10/10

The album is split into two sides--one mostly a platter of electro/art pop with sparse vocals that predated the New Wave movement by a solid 4-5 years; while the other is a deep exploration of Eno-esque ambient soundscapes that still sound pretty cutting-edge. If there's one complaint I can lodge against this album, it may have to do with the pacing; in my opinion it would've been better to sequence the ambient material with the pop, as one side made up strictly of slow-moving soundscapes can get a little dreary. No big deal. That's what the "shuffle" function is for, right?

The Who, on this DVD, are looking young and fit as they explode through a bunch of their early hits, including "I Can't Explain," "Young Man Blues," "My Generation" and an almost complete run through of "Tommy."  Probably my favorite part of the video is Pete during "My Generation."  He looks like a machine doing endless windmills and cool guitar licks.

Apart from professing his undying love for Yoko Ono and shocking the world with a full-frontal album cover, it is difficult to see what John Lennon hoped to accomplish with these experimental doodles. It is even more difficult to comprehend why he would trash his artistic integrity. "Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins" was rubbish in 1968 and no historical revisionism (let alone digital remastering) can salvage this aural embarrassment.

A very solid offering from what I consider his peak period.  From Madman, to Honky Chateau, into Don't Shoot Me, culminating with Goodbye Yellow Brick.  All excellent, all worth having.  Looking back over 35+ years, I'd rate this as the least excellent of that quartet, but all are worthy.

So the rumor is that Jazzy Jeff and Will were sellouts and their music is wack. MYTH! Most people think Eminem represents the best of hiphop music today because he wins a grammy. MYTH! See everyone else just makes their decision based upon someone else's gossip! Go back and take some listens and decide for yourself. Okay, their music was based upon making record sales and getting airplay, but listen to "Pump Up The Bass," and especially the track "He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper," and tell me that Will didn't have some mic skills! Because he does. Not the best, but you can't deny his legitimacy on the mic. Rappers today like Nelly, Ludacris, Lil' Jon, can make catchy, radio-oriented stuff, but listen to them and they really have no skill. So why write off Will when you sit there bumping and gobbling up albums from lame rappers like the ones I just mentioned? Will had great storytelling talent too, most of his most famous songs involved stories that relate to the choruses. They may have been somewhat-childish stories about struggling to make it to work or school, or girl situations, but he never fantasized and deceived us into trying to believe some gangsta drug-selling, shootouts, or orgy tall tales. Really, Slick Rick doesn't have much on Will when it comes to storytelling hiphop. Will, man I respect you and you should be proud of the music, as well as the televison show, that you graced us with back in the day!

A few of the guest performances fall flat, but The Wall was always as much about the creative, theatrical stage show as it was the music.  This is the only video release that lets you see Roger's vision of how the show was to play out live.  Since the original performances of The Wall in 1980-81 (with Pink Floyd) were filmed poorly, this may be the only video release of The Wall live ever.

But after hearing lots and lots of Billie since, I still think that this collection has been the most galvanizing of Billie Holiday listening experiences.  Her voice was in absolute perfect pitch here.  Her voice sounded a bit deeper in previous recordings (unless that's due to the production), and her voice got more ragged as the years progressed.  But here she sings like a cornet; the only person that I've heard that tried to sing like her and even came close was probably Dinah Washington (but in her own way).  Billie could sing at a pitch that is absolutely exhilarating.  If this is what you want to hear, or if this is making you curious, then get these recordings and you'll immediately know what I mean.

Hotel California had it all: top rate musicianship, excellant songwriting, and great sonic production. That's why it gets 5 stars. The remastered sound quality on this 2004 release brings it right up to modern levels. What I don't have anything good to say about is the packaging! You cannot tell the remastered version from the 20 year old original that I owned! Everything is identical. You get NO new liner notes, No new pictures, and NO bonus tracks! Warner Brothers didn't even have to reprint new cd booklets, cause their the same! How CHEAP can you get. It's just another case of the music industry ripping off the consumer.

Overall, just like "Pictures in the Sky," this would be a great album for kids to grow up with.  There are so many truths in Rich's music.  If anyone listens to these songs enough, they will pick up theological concepts and an excellent Christian belief structure.  The topics covered include God's love, eternity, moral living, salvation, sin, human love - the list goes on and on.  Also, this album will cheer you up when you're running errands or paying the bills.  And that's what life is all about, isn't it?  Enjoying God's presence and His gifts.  Rich's music enriches life with a strong focus on Jesus and poetry that reaches to our souls.
For those who are into lighting and sound and stagecraft, you'll see 12 year old technology that hasn't been touched by any other act. No one has come close. Short of Pink Floyd setting off a nuclear weapon over a stadium it's hard to imagine how the enormity of this creation could be topped.
It would be nice to see a remastered, updated version of this DVD, with perhaps some interviews with the band to get their perspective on the reunion.  Until that happens, this will have to do.  Sit back, turn up the sound, and be prepared to be blown away.

Lately, though, the company has been producing pretty bad products. From the terrible sounding "The Pretenders", to the gaps that never existed on "Heartbeat City" (and the defective HDCD encoding, too!), to the defective Doors CDs - Audio Fidelity is not what it used to be at all. Plus, the fact that they don't even use master tapes anymore (they had to remove the slogan "From the original master tapes" after it was demonstrated they weren't using them, anyway) while the big labels use them all the time, and competition from the original producer of 24K CDs, Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs,  has made AF irrelevant nowadays.

Fortunately--and amazingly--the results of Becker and Fagen's exertions  live up to the expectations that accompany such a lengthy (an unexpectedly  arrested) hiatus. Two Against Nature is an instant classic of their canon,  building upon the fractured blues boogie of Pretzel Logic, the brooding  power of Royal Scam, the jazz-bomb pop of Aja and the decadent post-disco  dance fever of Gaucho, creating a timeless sound in the process that's as  much at home today as it would have been in 1978.

Track Listing
"Hotel California" is one of their best singles ever; and it makes a stunning opening number for this number. The Eagles prove themselves to be kings with this one! The complex musical arrangement is the perfect complement to the vocals; and that's grand. "Hotel California" got lots of airplay when it was originally released; and we always requested the station that would play it most frequently when we were going back and forth from school on our school bus. (The bus had a radio even back then, believe it or not. We had a long commute each way; and the school finally caved in and let us have a radio on the school bus to make the trip much more pleasant.) I simply don't know many songs that are artistically superior to "Hotel California;" this one ranks very high in my book.

And New Wave is what you get, especially if New Wave can be synonymous with "unconventional". The first track, "Fantastic Voyage", sounds pretty mainstream, but  starting with the next track and continuing until the end, you encounter African beats; native chanting; Middle Eastern instrumentation; searing, crunching, grating guitar; "fuzzy" guitar; melodic guitar; and sporadic guitar chords tossed out in random keys. And if you listen closely, in "D.J." (my favorite track) you can catch a faint glimmer of dying disco. Never afraid to experiment, Bowie tries on different vocal styles, of which the most notable for me is the extremely speedy and talky vocal on "African Night Flight". Contrasting sounds and moods are utilized. "Boys Keep Swinging" flows nicely like "Prettiest Star" from "Aladdin Sane" at first, but evolves into a fairly raucous dance-rock track. On "Red Money", various dissonant techno sounds and complex vocal harmonies coexist with a more conventional repeated classic rock riff. On "Red Sails", smooth layered synths contrast with searing  guitar.

There is a lot of history here, and the truth of the matter is that the band was not half bad.  Schwartz was an excellent guitarist whose riffs sound as good today as when they first rang from his guitar 30 years ago and Charlie Allen's soulful and powerful vocals were ahead of the times.  One last bit of trivia, the band was so good that they played on the soundtrack to Otto Preminger's movie "Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon".
9. Metallica-When A Blind Man Cries-(B-Side)-(recorded during the sessions)-Of course Metallica the mighty have to be different and not do a song that people would know, as usual. But is this bad? Nope. This is by far the best song on the album hands down. And they did their homework as usual. Metallica really do know how to cover songs, and not over do it, or under do it. They've covered many for years. So hats off to the boys, this one is good. Sounds very close to the original. And Kirk actually pulls off some great sounding Richie Blackmore tones. Also being that Ian Paice was/is a big influence on Lars, he really shows it by having the same drum sound, and playing it verbatim. :)

9822	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	LOW is one of those albums that you pull out from time to time just to hear something different and get away from the pablum of your more normal (*ahem*) records.  LOW is schizophrenic in that half of the album contains vocal tracks while the rest is comprised of instrumentals done with collaborator Brian Eno.  In the midst of his 1970's cocaine highs, David Bowie decided to get away from it all.  He picked up and moved to West Berlin, where this album and (I believe) his next two with Eno were recorded.  Apparently, the studio was very close to the Berlin Wall and Bowie could see over it into East Berlin.  I imagine that what he saw was major inspiration for the music on this fascinating album.  He looks one direction and see the vibrant night-life of West Berlin.  He looks over the wall and sees the dark, desolate dreariness of East Berlin.  Thus goes the album.  The first half is more energetic and I liken that to his experiences in West Berlin.  Standouts include "Breaking Glass" and "Always Crashing In the Same Car".  But the second half of this album takes a more dreary turn.  I love the instrumental work here.  "Warzsawa" is a masterpiece.  It's funny, but the more I thought about it, I realized that some of the instrumental music probably fit the drab lives of East Berliners so perfectly.  And with the spectre of the Berlin Wall hanging above them day and night, an aptly-titled somber instrumental like "Subterraneans" seems to be music for a film about them trying to dig under the wall to the west.  Anyway, a great album, one of Bowie's most mysterious in a catalogue full of bizarre works.
This is a good CD to put in your CD player...if you're having a stressed out, bummer of a day.


Feet of Flames showcases MORE than just Celtic-style dancing.  There are musical numbers by both a female duo and a solo singer.

TOOL is about right-brain, manly metal music. It is about introspective lyrics that, on the face of things, are difficult to figure out. It is about anger (read the words to Aenima, the song). And it is about creating songs not for radio, but for texture, for complexity, for emotion, and for density.

The studio disc here is disappointing, as ever with Cream, but at least this time the stereo sound stage is normal and the sound and placing of the drums is convincing. The problem is with the overdubbing of guitars and the usual studio frigidity of the whole thing. Another problem is the thin, brittle sound of Clapton's guitars. The remastered versions on the 4disc set 'Those Were The Days' are better in this respect with a warmer guitar sound.

Though Madonna had great videos before this set (such as the ultra-glamorous "Vogue") this group reveals the cinematic approach La M takes on each video.  She tries to out do the next by making each one better and more interesting.  And, that is, of course, why we are continually drawn to her.  My personal favorites, though I like them all, are "Frozen", "Secret", "Rain" and "Take a Bow".  Visually, you don't get much better than Madonna when it comes to videos.  Buy this dvd and Madonna will justify your love for her.

This recording made Maria Cristina Kiehr a star, and she has never sounded better than as Maddalena. Her clear voice expresses longing, indecision, passion and tranquillity with equal facility, and is never less than completely beautiful.  Her expressions, as Maddalena changes course, develop brilliantly.  Her cry of "Signor, pietate!" is the pivot of the whole thing - high drama indeed.
We're gonna have a good time.

6402	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have been going through my 1000+ CDs for the Popular Culture class I teach and I have come to the conclusion that "Madman that was the only place to hear "Levon," which was my favorite song for about half a year (I believe it was replaced by "Knife's Edge" by Emerson, Lake & Palmer). Consequently, the shift in my musical appreciation from Top Forty to more sophisticated musical forms can be traced to this particular song and this special album.
The album begins with the classic title track, an anthem of epic proportions. Musically, it's quite simple and repetitive, yet effective. Bruce narrates from the view of a Vietnam vet, who despite his troubles with family, war, and country, still proudly proclaims to be "Born in the USA." This song is really moving from a lyrical perspective. "Cover Me" is an excellent upbeat rock n' roll song, very memorable and catchy. "Darlington County" is a happy, summertime song, evoking an earlier Sprinsteen. "Working on the Highway" is easily one of my favorites, a fast, simple number with great guitar and organ instrumentation. I also absolutely love "Downbound Train," a depressed yet hopeful and inspiring song recounting a relationship gone sour. The short "I'm on Fire" is subtly ingenious, beautiful and touching. "No Surrender" and the very sad "Bobby Jean" bring a classic rock spirit, while remaining with the album's theme. "I'm Going Down" may be my favorite Springsteen song at least musically, it's so underrated. It almost has a country vibe to it, it showcases one of Bruce's finest performances and the songwriting is just great. The album closes with three of his best known songs. "Glory Days" is the anthemic look at the past through the eyes of one man. The amazing "Dancing in the Dark" is one of the best arrangements Bruce has put together, providing an inspired performance through his verses and a unique musical approach. Lastly, the slow "My Hometown" is a moving conversation from a father to a young boy.

Having seen it, I only want to say that there are certain points that get kind of annoying, like "Anytime, Anywhere," on which the Latin rhythm track overtakes the poor girl's voice. Also, on "Nella Fantasia," she tells everyone the trouble she went through just to get it recorded, but I won't get into that. Jeepers, Sarah! You don't have to tell the whole story on how you got to get the song recorded!
A Big Amen to all the previous reviewers who gave this one a five star rating!!! This is a "must-have" classic concert dvd from Fleetwood Mac, espcially if you're having a "Fleetwood Mac Attack"!!! This DVD is the perfert cure. This contains 22 songs, each one of the artists get featured in this concert. You get to enjoy all their classics. I really enjoyed Stevie Nick's & Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and especially Christine McVie. Christine is very, very, talented. I didn't realize she could play keyboards so well. She ended the concert perfectly with "Songbird". This is a Classic and I highly recommend it!!!

Whew! That said, this one`s a bit shy on the bonus material, and the liner notes state why, but the booklet compensates for this shortcoming nicely. While this is not one of Procol`s best efforts, there is enough essential material here to justify the purchase, even if it`s just for the remastering of the Trower-penned 'Whiskey Train', the chilling, Poe-like lyrics of 'The Dead Man`s Dream', the lyrical threats ("I`ll darken your Christmas,I`ll piss on your door") of 'Still There`ll Be More', the great guitar and drumming bits on 'About To Die', or the sheer,eternal magnificence of 'Whaling Stories'.

3298	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Imogen Heap tries to be the next Alanis on this album, but she only succeeds in taking Alanis's worst traits and magnifying them. Lyrics not edited from spur of the moment inspiration, a voice that isn't attractive at all, and wannabe rock out moments. She tries to do it all with her style as well, and fails. The only decent songs on here are "Candlelight" and "Come here Boy" and there are moments in those songs that are repulsive as well. The result is a muddled album with no focus at all, playing the forlorn star in her own eyes. There's potential in all of these songs. But she tries too hard copping an "angry gurrrrl" attitude that it ruins the moment. Skip this album if you can. I'm glad I bought it used.

It is a fitting recognition of the changes in that spot and the world in general that so many people could gather and celebrate the tearing down of 'The Wall'! A symbol of so much pain, fear, control and death...
Better live CD's to get would be Make a Jazz Noise Here, The Best Band You Never Heard, and many of the "Beat the Boots"  Unfortunately, most of the Beat the Boots CD's have the best concert performances, but the worst sound.  Vol 5 of this series is interesting because it contains some very old Mothers material.
But what IS great about this album.....it's Bill Hicks!  How can you go wrong.  I have only discovered this man a couple of weeks ago, and and within that short amount of time, I had found myself growing addicted to the man.  He was funny....and yet, he makes you laugh AND think at the same time.  This is a very rare thing.

El Condor Pasa (If I Could)
Band 18: Jussi Bjrling and Renata Tebaldi - 1956 (14:08) - This one band by itself makes the disc worth the price. A segment of a TV production call "Producer's Showcase", the scene is self-consciously introduced by the great actor Charles Laughton, who seems to be embarrassed by the execrably written introduction he has to read. The scene picks up the first act of La Bohme at "Che gelida manina" and runs to the end of the act. The singers are rotund, the acting is not quite High School level, but the singing is unforgettable! Both singers are in excellent voice; both voices are beautifully plangent and absolutely perfect for Puccini, the conductor is the excellent Max Rudolf. I could go on, but you get the idea.
I also attained a greater appreciation for the musicianship. I'd never been largely impressed by Adam Jones's playing, now I see that he is a very creative and talented guitarist. Not really mind-blowing technically, but the dense, gritty atmospheres he creates on this album are a large part of what makes this such a cool and unique experience to listen to.  And, of course, Danny Carey rules.  I always knew that, but hey, who says you can't enjoy a good thing just a little bit more, huh?  His drumming is insanely complex, yet at the same time very unique and diverse.  From the tribal-like beats of "Eulogy", to the furious double-bass of "Forty Six and Two", he never gets boring, and never fails to impress.

Yes, People's Instinctive Travels and The Low End Theory were masterpieces, but so was Midnight Marauders.  First of all, "Award Tour", which in my opinion is their best single, is on here.  This album is bangin' from "Steve Biko (Stir It Up)" through "God Lives Through".  There is absolutely no filler on this album.  1993 was Hip Hop's golden year, and this, along with "Enter The Wu-Tang", were the best albums to come out that year.

A Hole in the Head is a gem and joy to watch, by the great Frank Capra.
Was it always like this? I don't seem to remember it being like this.
All that being said, nearly every track on this album soars, from the creepy, haunted "Getting Scared" to the overwhelmingly powerful "Useless" and the angst-ridden, voice-breaking "Angry Angel".  This album is incredible, but it sure is different.  Consider yourself warned (and encouraged!).
Tony Bennett's "MTV Unplugged" is one of my earliest Tony Bennett recordings from my collection. I truly enjoyed Tony Bennett's live performances, which bring out the best in him. I've also watched this concert aired on MTV. Mr. Bennett, whose voice is one of the most distinguishable and remarkable voices in the music world, is a living musical legend. He has reached the pinnacle of his career and is one of the few who made it to the top echelon and maintained his musical status all these years.

"Madman Across the Water" made it to #8 on the Billboard album chart. Since most of the songs were five minutes or longer, this was really the last Elton John album before he started turning out a string of Top 40 hits. But the best albums on any Elton John album were almost always the songs you never heard on AM radio. Ironically, given its place in my musical history, "Levon" made its way onto the third volume of Elton John's greatest hits collection even though it only made it to #24 on the single charts in 1972 ("Tiny Dancer" made it to only #41). Just another example of the cherished memories of our youth turning out to be phantasms when seen in the harsh light of day (or commercial music industry interests).

1081	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I am giving this 5 stars because it is so bad that it actually warps around and has merit.  Given the way Shatner sounds in some of these songs, I would swear this had other influences involved.  Nothing can compare to Shatner's genius with Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds and Mr. Tambourine man.  The Shakespeare things make this CD worth it.  Although, the last piece convinces me that he was on some serious drugs.

For me the bonus track "Sally G" is a great add-on as that was the B-side to "Junior's Farm" and became a hit in its own right on both the Hot 100 and country charts. This is a great country song if I ever heard one.

The tour, which unofficially marks Pink Floyd's retirement from the live arena, not only wowed audiences with amazing screen visuals, laser effects and lighting but also included startling oddities such as inflatable pigs, floating spaceships and burning planes. Offering a wealth of extras and sound options, Pulse remains a staggering visual production more than a decade on, with the band performing key albums The Division Bell and The Dark Side Of The Moon almost in their entirety. "I suppose we better get on with it then," Pink Floyd frontman David Gilmour grumbles after a mammoth introductory version of Syd Barrett tribute Shine On You Crazy Diamond, with the subsequent lavish Storm Thorgerson visuals elevating classic Floyd tracks as High Hopes and Another Brick In The Wall and neatly complementing the stereo assault of this pristine DVD. Pink Floyd: after all, they're only extraordinary men.


His songwriting isn't impressive at all, either.  So much of his lyrics on this album are like what you'd read from an angry high schooler's notebook who's in an introductory philosophy class, so it's like a mix of bad, angsty poetry and pseudo-intellectual ramblings.  Some songs like "Fourty Six and Two" and "Third Eye" exemplify the pseudo-intellectual lyrics, while songs like "Hooker With a Penis" (brilliant song title) have lyrics as if they were yanked straight out of an angry 15 year-old's mouth.
This is an essential rock'n roll album and of course an essential Bowie album.

"Hotel California" is absolutely overrated garbage. In 1976, as a hardcore 12-year-old music fan, I recognized the Eagles as the epitome of everything that was wrong with music. That opinion will never soften.
If you thought we were standing on the brink of a brave new world  where Love was no longer in chains, where the souls of humanity were no  longer imprisoned in the shackles of conventional thinking... if you stood  at a concert like this and thought you could see a better tomorrow, buy  this DVD, because about 15 minutes into it you'll be seeing it again;  you'll be throwing chairs through your windows, wanting your hair to grow  faster, running up to the attic to find those old bell-bottoms and those  calfskin boots, you'll be turning it up louder and louder, you'll go out to  the front of your conformist suburban house and you'll break out a step  ladder and you'll spraypaint a gigantic "peace" sign on the front  of that two-story colonial and your wife and you will make love on the  front lawn and get arrested and... just buy it.

1839	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Tale of the Fox" is a very professionally-done and fitting tribute to a great drummer and great person who was stricken with such a horrible illness and died so young.  The one potential knock against this DVD is the lack of KISS footage and contributions from Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons (Bruce Kulick appears in many clips and Ace Frehley appears in a clip where he accepted Carr's plaque for his 1995 Rockwalk induction) but, to me, that doesn't detract from the DVD at all.  There are a myriad of KISS releases that show live shows with Eric and interviews.  This DVD shows clips most fans have never seen before: photos of Eric Car as a child and playing his first drum kit (it even has audio of his first recorded drum solo in 1967!), home movies with much of the footage filmed only months before his death, and backstage films of Eric providing commentary on the rock star's life (he seemed to really enjoy doing commentary on almost anything). Plus, there are some interview clips in his KISS makeup and some KISS live footage; such things are not completely absent from this DVD.
This album, production aside, felt like it was done in a matter of just speeding the process along and getting something out. Scott Weiland's vocal style also at the time didn't really feel fitting with the theme of the band, which felt very much like a gnr band.

The biggest problem was that because of the spectacular light show which will range from a few lights to a lot of lights, sometimes the gain on the cameras is so high it's more grainy than it should be. But only sometimes!
The interview portions with Joey Molland & Mike Gibbins are pretty good.  Entirely unprofessional, but at least they're not phony.  Mike can be a little long-winded, but it's all right because you learn a few minor facts that you might not have already known.
The Chick Corea Elektric Band was one of those colorful jazz groups in the 80's to just turn on nice melodic jazz/rock/pop/fusion music. No matter how the critics and jazz purists try to catogorize this into flimsy worthless jazz idioms, I must say, as a lover of  jazz  of any kind (excluding that awful R&B influenced popular radio deamed as 'smooth jazz') I aboslutely love the music on this disk.
The photos are ugly. The recordings are uglier. This is the barrel bottom of Sixties crapola, and that's coming from a devoted John Lennon fan.
Imagine if Beethoven made a dvd talking about what he was thinking during this or that movement. These guys aren't quite at that level, but they are certainly some of rock's finest composers and arrangers, and seeing them do what they do best is a major treat.
As I found out reading on other sites, fans of the group love this cd and even go far as saying this is Skillet greatest and most accesible album to date and rightly so, Skillet's Comatose is full of skill and completely self-aware. That's what I like about the album. Yes there are some songs that remind you of other groups, for example, I was reminded of Evanescence in some tracks (like the awesome title track "Comatose") and some to Nickelback ("Say Goodbye"), hell sometimes they even kind of sound like another great Christian group called Anberlin (check their song "Paperthin Hymn", a true gem), nevertheless the songs are original enough to stand on their own and to satisfy anyone hungry for good melodic rock.
For the record, the name "Napoleon Dynamite" was a pseudonym used by Declan on this album. It was appropriated for the movie years later, even though the director claimed he never heard of this album (which I doubt personally)...
Orbison's classic songs are embellished by Bruce Springsteen, T-Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Mike Utley, Tom Waits plus other lesser-known but very talented artists.

From about 1968 until somewhere around 1978, Zappa made a lot of great music.  The comedy was a little more surreal than it was vulgar and it was carried by stronger tunes, and his tributes to the greasy music of his youth were played almost straight. But Zappa was at his best in the long-form, eclectic instrumental suites that combined Stravinsky-influenced classical, various strains of jazz and rock, and zany sounds that sound inspired by the soundtracks to classic Warner Brothers cartoons. Some of these pieces are built from fragments, while others are more unified compositions (like the fantastic big-band pieces on "The Grand Wazoo" and "Waka-Jawaka"). Like the Beatles and Brian Wilson, Zappa labored over these pieces, overdubbing dozens of instruments, speeding things up, slowing things down, careful to keep the rhythms and tonality straight. (Most of this period was pre-synthesizers.)  His perfectionism pays off; they sound amazingly tight and they swing whenever they need to. They still sound fresh and fantastic now.
Hip-O has done a great service for Townshend and Who fans by making this available again (with some terrific bonus tracks no less expanding on the original release)after Ryko's CD went out of print. The remastering sounds extremely good on this edition and the price is just right for fans.
Then the end credits with the last 2 minutes of Starship Trooper, Steve with his Double Neck Guitar, Chris with Fuzzed Bass, Jon at the mellotron next to Alan, while Rick does an amazing Moog Solo.
Stand Out songs: "I Am On The Rock" "Creed" "Seen And Not Heard"(yeah I know it sounds like the Kiss song "Heavens On Fire" but it's a straight forward song that needs to be heard by so-called Christians who say it but don't live it) and "Underground"

The final segment, featuring a complete orchestra, has two great opening numbers and finishes with the only number I didn't care but, by then, I have more than my fill of great blues and rock 'n roll. However, it's still fun to see everyone dressed in black tie and evening gowns, anyway.
I thought the tracks from "Dive" a little unusual, as well as the male dancers, but aside from that, I really enjoyed the package as a whole. You really get the softer, more gentle side to Sarah's voice as well as her character with this show. In the brief explanatory interludes proceeding some songs as well as during the songs themselves, she comes through as a real person, and not just some performer standing on a stage and singing without any apparent notice of the crowd at all.
Its brand of jazz-fusion with classical and funk touches is similar to that of "Hot Rats", although it is a bit lighter in

6843	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I reviewed this album many years ago (see below), so Amazon won't let write another separate review on the Box Set; therefore, I am putting it right here.  Of all the endless overpriced box sets that have been unleashed on the baby boomers to capitalized on the sketchiest of material, this one is by far the best.  I also own the Band on the Run and Tug of War boxes, and they are OK, but this one is special for a number of reasons.  First, it has the nicest packaging, with a handsome cloth-type cover.  Secondly, it has 5, count 'em, FIVE discs: the original LP (which has the best remastering of all the Archive remasters so far), the bonus songs CD (which really good), the previously unavailable mono mix which was specially prepared for AM radio stations (which sounds monster good!), the videos on DVD, which have a nice charm about them, and last but not least, Thrillington, the odd failure all instrumental LP of Ram, which was recorded just after Ram was released but not itself released until 1977, with no mention of McCartney's involvement.  It sank without a trace, but it is absolutely brilliant, a perfect recast of the album as a lite jazz (but still rockin') recreation.  And the remastering on it is superb.  I have the original 1977 LP, and it blows it away, sound wise.
As soon as the concert beings Hendrix starts with Hey Baby the vocals sound really bad and it seems like the recordings is really garbled sound quality wise. Then hendrix plays Foxy Lady which is really bad.

For fans of the style, Thompson's early singles offer a swell "new" set of teenpop tunes outside the usual Brill Building standards by Carole King and her pals.  John D. Loudermilk wrote most of these tunes, which were recorded for the independent Hickory label, and they are actually pretty fun to listen to. This 18-song CD is more generously programmed than other Thompson best-ofs, and sticks more strictly to her early work. It's not very country, but it is a lot of fun!

Hark the Herald Angels sing starts out with an orchestral arrangement, and moves to synthesizer.
Her vocals are often processed to accentuate lushness. The live presentations differ from the studio versions of her songs in varying degrees, most of the time noticably, sometimes just enough to enjoy them as new performances. But the real pleasure comes from watching Sarah herself. She's charming and beautiful, with the most captivating blue-gray eyes, and hair as thick as wild jungle vines. Hell, she has so much poise, I'd pay to watch this woman do her nails.

Mercury has finally released a definitive box set covering the Queen of Blue-Eyed Soul's entire career, from a home recording of a ragtime medley to a version of "Someone to Watch Over Me" cut for a tv commercial that is understood to be the last recording Dusty Springfield ever made. Kudos to Mike Gill and Paul Howes for taking on the daunting task of selecting just two to four tracks from each project Dusty was involved in, and for being so generous with the material from the 70s and 80s that hadn't made it to CD until now. Every hit is here and all the key LP tracks, as well as cuts recorded with other artists and one-offs. Listening to the box as a whole, I'm struck by the sheer volume of great material Dusty lent her unique, inimitable, totally moving voice to throughout her career. For every superb overlooked or unreleased cut, like her takes on Jaye P. Morgan's "Closet Man," Janis Ian's "In the Winter," Melissa Manchester's "Home to Myself" and Peter Allen's "Quiet Please There's A Lady on Stage," there are three or four equally excellent tracks that necessarily had to be left off this set. This will have to do until Bear Family exhumes the entire Dusty Springfield oeuvre for one of their own legendary 9 or 10 CD box sets. Until then, this is indispensable

It follows U2 as they're touring for, and recording, the Rattle and Hum album, which is a tribute to Americana music. It's spectacular. They play Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For with a Harlem church choir, perform with BB King, and record tracks at Sun Studios. There are some songs in the movie that really pulls at your heart, one specifically is Sunday Bloody Sunday they're performing the same day (a Sunday nonetheless) as the Remembrance Day Bombing in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Bono has the ability to convey through voice the emotion in his heart, and it's difficult to listen to him sing without becoming emotionally involved int he song. There is some comment on picture quality not being as expected on HD DVD and BD, but this movie was not shot in HD, so it's to be expected. The shots shot on Hi-8 look quite grainy indeed, and the shots in film look crisp, but still like film. I think the effect is actually quite pleasing and fits the feel of the movie.

Even John Belushi's imitation of him has lost some of its punch for we aren't accustomed to seeing the two-ton powerhouse flail spastically, his head bobbing up and down towards the skies, then back to the footlights, on our stages on a regular basis.  Be that as it may, Cocker's comeback didn't really take.  "Across From Midnight" is a sturdy enough tune but it won't set young hearts afire--middle aged ones either, and I don't think you'll harm yourself by skipping forward this one on the DVD.

"Ram" shows that  McCartney could write some good material without the other Beatles. It's  sad that McCartney hasn't performed any songs from "Ram" in over  two decades, as some of his better material is here.  "Too Many  People" is a good song, as is "Uncle Albert" and "Eat  At Home."  The garage-band sound of "Smile Away" shows that  McCartney can really rock when he wants to. I've worn out my vinyl copy of  "Ram," as well as two cassettes, and think it deserves to be  listed among McCartney's top-five best.

We start off which a great Guitar and bass rift on Sucker train Blues, and we continue on to Do it For the Kids, illegal I Song, Spectacle, headspace, Superhuman, Set me Free, Dirty little thing and loving the Alien, all great rockers. You will at least like all these songs. I saved three for special mention. The first single is Slither a great hard rock song, it comes right between your eyes, it rocks and has a great guitar lead, something missing in so much of today's music, also it has interesting lyrics and a great chorus. Now I want to mention the two songs we can call melodic on hear fall to pieces and you Got No right. Fall to pieces is hardly melodic, but is slightly slower tempo them the average song on contraband, it is very heavy and introspective lyrics and just is a flat out great song. I can see it as another single and hit. And lastly YOU Got No right is a slow down melodic song, still has edge and is somewhat heavy, has GREAT lyric and is Beattlesque in a way, and I think can be a big hit. This Album (CD) hearkens back to the great bands of times past, Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, Zeppelin, Deep purple, Grand Funk Railroad, Aerosmith, Van Halen, Guns N Roses and Stone temple pilots, errrr Oh yea this is GNR and STP, you wonder why its so dang good. Probably the best album released in rock n rool in the last five years.

Scott Weiland is great vocalist- but his project, Velvet Revolver can only dream about the same success as Guns N' Roses.

But I can't live with this.  Sub-sub-bootleg sound quality.  Way too short of a running time and a bad track selection to boot ("Circus of Heaven"???)  Want bonus material?  Dream on, fellow traveler!  And to top it all off, and I swear I'm not making this up, the band was performing "in the round" on a revolving stage, and the geniuses who shot this thing used stationary cameras, so you get to stare at Chris Squire's back while Steve Howe is soloing, or Rick Wakeman's armpit while Jon Anderson is singing.  That's while you're straining to make out what song they're playing through the sludge of distorted mess that makes up the sound.
1975's Katy Lied and 1976's Royal Scam still only took 13  months a piece, with Aja then emerging in 1977 after 18 months of studio  work and the group's apparent swansong, Gaucho, being released 39 months  after that. Then (barring solo albums) studio silence, until now--when Two  Against Nature hits the racks, 19 years and 3 months after its predecessor.  Of course, Becker and Fagen didn't spend all of that time in the studio (at  least not together), but it's still a fair bet, knowing the perpetrators'  reputation, that this album entailed a monumentally long and painstaking  detailed recording process, even by today's slowpoke superstar standards.

5426	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This album was released at a time when Cohen was almost forgotten, about seven years before the tribute albums I'm Your Fan and Tower Of Song would spur renewed interest in his work. Warnes' interpretations are always graceful and moving. She understands Cohen's music well, having done backing vocals on some of his albums like Various Positions, and she covers his songs with loving dedication.
One thing you've gotta remember about Tool is that all of their albums are vastly different from each other.  If you go in expecting one to sound like the other, you'll be disappointed.  Maynard once said somewhere that beliefs will only corrupt you and hold you down, therefore it is wiser to believe in nothing (sorry if I butchered that quote, I'm really just paraphrasing there), and listening to their albums seems to reflect this standpoint.  They seem to like to keep everyone on their toes, and let everyone know that they are far from a predictable band.  This is just my opinion, but I really think there should be more bands like this.

The sound quality is terrible: ranging the gamut from muffled  to slightly distorted vocals because of a too-loud transfer.  But that's  not the worst of it...after you suffer through it all and think you're  finally going to enjoy the last video which is "Sweet Dreams (Are Made  Of This)", they start rolling credits over the video!  Would it have  killed them to wait three minutes for the video to end before rolling the  credits!  Obviously a rush job designed to make a quick buck, this  deserves to be left on the shelf!  (Fortunately, I was able to return it  and bought Gloria Estefan's "Don't Stop!" instead.  Although the  music's of a different style, it shows exactly how a music DVD *should* be  put together: crisp video and audio, and lots of extras.)

Every song on here is great, but the standout tracks would probably be "Fantastic Voyage," "Red Sails," "D.J.," "Look Back In Anger," "Boys Keep Swinging," and "Repetition." Track 4, "Yes, Ass Sin" (Turkish For: Long Live,) is a little bit weaker than the rest of the songs because it's sort of repetative, but it's still far from bad. I highly recommend getting this CD. It might be very experimental, but it's experimental in a good way!

9608	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This album has a long performance art piece on the first side, and on the second side includes the listener in a hospital stay during which Yoko miscarried a baby conceived with John. It is the second album of a trilogy of sorts, all dealing with the early stages of their relationship as lovers and artistic collaborators (the other albums are 'Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins' and 'Wedding Album'). Of the three I like 'Wedding Album' best, but this one has power. Not very interesting musically, 'Life with the Lions' is a fascinating artifact of the end of the Beatles era (and the end of the '60s). The performance on side one was done live in Cambridge in early March 1969; it's more an event than music, in keeping with Yoko's avant-garde roots. The second side starts with a half-sung tune by Yoko from her hospital bed, while John echoes her (the material was captured by a cassette tape recorder). She muses about the hospitalization, the fate of 'Two Virgins', and being John's girlfriend (he was still married to Cynthia). The next track records the baby's heartbeat (with a microphone held to Yoko's abdomen). Two minutes of silence follow, giving the miscarried child a funeral of sorts; this track has the most impact on me, because the silence goes deeper than any words could. The last track on the side sounds like cards being shuffled; it's actually a radio dial being flicked across radio stations, and as an exercise in boredom is on par with Warhol. The album as a whole, including the striking cover (the back shows John and Yoko surrounded by policemen on the street after a trial for possession of drugs), reveals these artists as determined to create their own media, rather than being used by the commercial media that turned the Beatles' fame against them. Although 'Revolution #9' (on the 'White Album') remains the most successful track John and Yoko collaborated on in the '60s (where Yoko is heard saying 'You become naked'), committed fans of John and Yoko should hear this album; the two share themselves completely with their listeners on it, and reinvent what a pop album can do and be. This CD release adds two tracks that do not appear on the original album.
12. One of the lesser songs on the album, I'm disappointed to hear this will be their next single/music video...I mean it's pretty good but doesn't hold anything against the others. That said, I guess it would be a great song to play if you're working out or something and are in need of some adrenaline boost. It's got a catchy hard rhythm. Also, the music video is going to be unique - it will start as animation on a moving train ("Polar Express" anyone?) and transform abruptly into reality.

He exhibits his skill at singing raspy screamers in "Monkberry Moon Delight" but can turn on a dime and sing so sweetly in "Heart of the Country."  He has so many colorations that his singing can bring a song to the next level.  Think of the amazing fade-out in "Hey Jude," and you'll know what I mean.  He truly was one of our greatest pop singers. (His voice seemed to show some of the ravages of time by the mid-'80s, but he still is a fantastic singer.)  Paul also shows his mastery of harmony in many of the songs in "Ram," with the layered vocals of "Dear Boy" being just one example.

The album and video has superb live versions of "On The Turning Away" and One of These Days". The fans' much reviled track "The Dogs of War" is superior to its studio counterpart with Nick Mason playing drums this time and Rick Wright playing on keyboards like he did in the old days (the two are the only two original Floyd members who did every tour) and of course David Gilmour's vocals and superb guitar work. The film on this track is breath taking with the German Shepard dogs running with the yellow eyes as if they were possessed by Satan himself. Other standouts are "Wish You Were Here" and "Learning To Fly". Some tracks are slightly edited like "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" and "Comfortably Numb".
796	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	In 2003, five rock stars, four of them have been well-known for many years, united to start a band.  Three former members of Guns & Roses, one former member of Stone Temple Pilots, and one former member of Slash's Snakepit formed Velvet Revolver.  All five members have encountered serious life issues, namely substance abuse and depression.  Immediately, they recorded a song for the "Daredevil Sdtk." called "Set Me Free".  Their album become highly anticipated due to the high musical quality.  However, others were scared that it may fall apart due to Scott Weiland's recent heroin use.  Doubters were proven wrong when they released their album "Contraband" in 2004.  Their Grammy-winning hit single "Slither" rocketed the charts and radio, and the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Charts.

Now that I do not attend church anymore, I still love to hear these songs, as they inspire me and make me feel peaceful.  I even listen to them while driving sometimes when I want a break from my usual fast-moving country and pop stuff.  John Talbot is a very smooth singer to listen to -- a diversion when one needs to get away from the noise of the modern world.  BTW, you don't have to be Catholic or any other religion to benefit from the effect these songs have on most people.

9393	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	A dark, disturbing journey through the ugly underbelly of the human mind, "Aenima" is Tool's masterpiece.  Tool explores the brooding, seething psyche better than any band on the planet, and delivers its  message of existential dread with utter conviction.  The songs on  "Aenima" constantly shift, morph and transform themselves,  sometimes raging with fury, sometimes settling into relaxed interludes that  still boil with a dark menace underneath their calm surface.  Maynard James  Keenan's vocal work is the key to Tool's power, heard to maximum effect in  such songs as "Eulogy," "Stinkfist" and the title track.  No singer in rock  captures the ambivalence and terror of the human experience as well as  Keenan.  When he and his outstanding bandmates are at full speed, they're  untouchable.  "Aenima" will bore into your brain with all the  subtlety of a jackhammer.

The second track "Big Momma Thing" was a banger, possibly because Jay-Z had an awesome second verse. And for some crazy reason, I have a taste for the song "We Don't Need It" even though Lil' Cease is garbage. Thats all I can think of thats good about this.

Just sit back, relax, close your eyes, and these songs will transport you to another place.
I know many people younger than myself will probably disagree, but I think this is still Imogen's finest album, by far, with the newer solo album SPEAK FOR YOURSELF in second place and FrouFrou a distant third.  Somehow this is her most sophisticated album in terms of variety of approach, sophistication of production style and texture, and overall energy.  It is an album brimming over with talent and top-notch performance, infectiously dramatic, ambitious in scope, and the document of a hugely talented young woman proving herself.

Opening and closing with "Shine On," Isham's camera does find incredible backstage footage of the elaborate laser light show accompanying the music. A giant round screen in the middle of the stage plays host to laser light and various film and video incarnations of the Pink Floyd songs being performed.

This was ours." Although Victim of Love is a well respected ballad, the remaining songs were written/directed essentially on the `get this album out on the charts and let Billboard sign the singing' aptitude. Unfortunately, most every great rock band of the past has had no choice but to age their stage to the typical Greatest Hits CD of today. Nevertheless, Hotel California has remained a studio decadence throughout the years - no lost guitar picks about it.

  The music is excellent! One moment it can be soft and haunting or it could be loud and exciting. "The Raiders March" is a great one and of course, everyone is familiar with the song. It's also a good example of loud and exciting. An example of a dark and haunting track is the next one "Main Title: South America 1936". That song is also great and it is played at the very beginning of the movie. The whole album is amazing and I will never forget the musioc.

6639	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Anyone that grew up in the 70's can't help, but have heard just about every track on this disc.  With the addition of Joe Walsh to the lineup The Eagles were at the top of their game with this one, and it is considered by many to be one of the classic albums of the 70's.  The band took on a heavier sound moving away from the more country rock roots of their earlier albums.  Several huge hits came from this one.  The title track with it's distinctive twin guitar solo at the end.  "New Kid In Town" one of the best "my ex girl is seeing someone else" songs ever written.  "Life In The Fast Lane" which pretty much describes the decadent lifestyle of southern California in the late 70's, and the life the band ws living at the time.  "Wasted Time" a Don Henley penned track about an ex-girlfriend.  The second half of the album did not get the airplay, but the songs are just as good.  "Victim Of Love" sung by Henley starts things out.  Joe Walsh's "Pretty Maids All In A Row" is a surprisingly subtle tune from Joe Walsh.  Randy Meisner's "Try And Love Again" with simply gorgeous vocals would prove to be his last with the band.  The album concludes with what to me is the best thing the Eagles ever created "The Last Resort"  This mini epic, written by Don Henley covers the history of California and how it came to be what it is (or was at the time) all in less than 8 minutes.  The lyrics are outstanding on this one, some of Henley's best, and it still has a poignant message to tell 30 years later.  Some fans of the band's older material looked at this album as a sell out of sorts, but to my ears this was their high water mark.
apart from the very cool opening of  "Sucker Train Blues" and "Set Me Free".
But Chip Davis is unique:  one knows it will be quality music, but it won't be cookie-cutter styling or even nuances of similar stylings. No, Chip Davis considers each piece on its own and decides what treatment best suits the melody, meaning, and even the era in which it was written. He is a comfortable with Gregorian chant as with Bach or the driving, uplifting beat of a "Mannheim Steamroller" arrangement. There is nothing cheap or simplistic; there are no travesties of the composer's/writer's intent. What a rare achievement this is!
In fact this album for a time is almost like the soundtrack my high school years because it reflects lonely I feel sometimes. In fact I strongly recommend this album to all who love music to listen to while thinking. It's very intelligent music that should be enjoyed by all generations.

This brilliant performance became a really great video for any true fan of the earlier forms of Yes (and not for the people who like their 80's stuff like "Owner Of A Lonely Heart").

Now, decades later, Carlos shows he has learned from this first experience by enlisting a whole hoard of artistes to create another mega monster album that sounds and plays a lot like a Various Artistes compilation album with Carlos the guitar sideman on all the tracks.  This recipe makes for a very good album that was richly deserving of all the Grammy awards that it took that year.  Carlos' guitar playing has also improved in its complexity and his tone has changed too showing that he has been practicing all this time as well.  The album has been produced very well and so the sound quality is quite good too.  All the lyrics are in the cd liner notes which makes it a very nice touch.
Frank's later bands often sounded rushed on live takes, hurrying through familiar numbers on their way to the more fun, more challenging stuff. In a related comparison, the difference between the original version of "Trouble Every Day" on "Freak Out" and the one here is just remarkable. It's been slowed down quite a bit to a true blues jam crawl but rocks along with the most distinctive, tremendous drum rolls I've ever heard. And Frank's solo on this one may just be his best ever. It's a raging wail of despair, most amazing. The lyrics have been edited (the song is faded out) and the song's all the more powerful for it; Frank's disgust is now fully focused on the Sad Conduct of the Citizens as seen on THE NEWS. In the original version he goes on to berate the Newscasters, who seem to take pleasure in their gruesome reports, which is another whole issue in itself, and worthy of a song of its own. It's my single favorite live Zappa performance, which is odd considering just how dour and angry is its tone. But the energy it radiates is tremendous.

"Burnt Weeny Sandwich" includes one of the very best of these compositions, "Little House I Used to Live In." The brilliant woodwind/keyboard prodigy Ian Underwood opens the piece with a moody piano solo that could have been written by Arnold Schoenberg. Then some delightful, sped-up music leads into the centerpiece, an amazing electric violin section performed by Sugar Cane Harris, a veteran LA R&B musician.  Starting out in a very bluesy mode, it evolves into a jazzy section that plays the fiddle against Mothers veteran Don Preston's piano. After a few more enjoyable fragments, and a superb Zappa guitar solo, it ends with a exciting snippet from a live concert in which Zappa solos on organ over a furious beat.

Chimes Of Freedom  (1988)  ****  Love his version of the Bob Dylan title track.
The Police in Monserrat segment is a real treasure, but the way it was so yellowed and faded really spoiled my enjoyment of it. About the only part of the content here which does look fantastic is the Old Grey Whistle Test footage. For this I am grateful, but it still does not offset the shabby treatment the rest of this DVD received.

Being a live show, the band was more interested to playing to the crowd than the movie camera, and this is as it should be.  The camera work was very good under the circumstances.  Sometimes a stage hand gets in front of the camera, and there is some "60's" style fast cutting and rapid zooming in and out but that annoying camera work is kept to a minimum.  As usual, the camera spends the least amount of time on John, who just stands there belting out intricate bass riffs as if it were boring and mundane work.  This is something that has always disappointed me, because I've always been mesmerized watching John's hands fly over his instrument.  It often appears that his mind is wandering, almost like his fingers have a life of their own.  I can understand why directors spend more time on the other band members, but it is unfortunate that they do.

  This has to be one of my favorite videos from Madonna. The video features Madonna as a chain-smoking business woman, who gets off work with a different guy every night. Christopher Walktins plays a strange guardian angel of some sort who goes back in time to see how Madonna's character was murdered. The video has that BODY OF EVIDENCE/DANGEROUS GAME theme.

2449	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Lots of griping going on about the quality of this release...from a technical standpoint, this performance was shot on videotape during 1994.  Just prior to the advent of high-definition recording, the maximum horizontal resolution for professional videotape was four hundred lines.  Whereas if the show had been shot on film, and the master print carefully preserved, it might easily have yielded one thousand lines or more.  Regardless of digital technology, they can only work so many miracles with a limited source tape!  For what it's worth to avid Pink Floyd fans, we hardcore ELP fanatics had to wait over three decades for the legitimate release of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's "holy grail" California Jam footage  ( and only one third of the set survived the ABC-TV editing block ).  Further, we only have that recording because an ABC employee made a copy of the broadcast master prior to the network erasing the tapes...said copy being made on the then industry workhorse VCR, a U-matic videocassette.  Our former pristine footage has been reduced to somewhere between 260-280 line resolution  ( slightly better than VHS quality ).  Unless future technology is able to coax eight hundred line resolution out of a four hundred line source, the DVD release of "Pulse" will remain about as good as it can get.  Count your blessings, Floyd fans...at least you have all of the stellar show!

To those who demur at the idea of Deep Purple without Ritchie Blackmore, I might point out Steve Morse is a genius. He's had a long career playing with The Dregs during the 70's as well as The Steve Mores Band and Kansas during the 80's. He twice got so sick of the business of the music industry that he quit and took a normal job, but found the pull of playing music too strong to stay away from his first love. He does a perfect job at filling Blackmore's shoes.

Band 12: Fyodor Chaliapin - 1933 (2:41) - A short, acted segment from the silent movie "The Maid of Pskov" (1917), followed by the 60 year old Chaliapin singing the "Chanson du duc" from Ibert's "Don Quichotte".

This is a fine recording and for the McCartney fan do yourself an enormous Faber and get yourself a copy!
The Gladiolas sing their Latin flavored "Little Darlin'," which is guaranteed to rock you with its natural energy and great rock feel; and The Hollywood Argyles sing "Alley Oop" very well as they bat this one straight out of the ballpark!

This particular album is one of the best arena rock records around, secular or Christian.  Songs like "Armed and Dangerous" and "Underground" beg to be heard in a large football stadium where the fans can sing along with lead vocalist, the underrated John Schlitt.

The only reason why this album is selling is because  of the guest stars and the Latin pop craze that's going on these days.  And  the only reason why Santana won those Grammies is because the Grammy  committee love to honor vets, especially those who score big comebacks. If  you really want to hear Santana, stick with the older albums.

We also get the album "Thrillington" an instrumental orchestral version of "Ram" that Paul and Linda dreamed up at the time and had Richard Hewson orchestrate, arrange and conduct. Paul chose NOT to participate on the album and it's an interesting album that became a bit of a collectable (it was finally released on vinyl in 1977 and on CD in the 1990's as I recall) when it was revealed that Paul was involved in creation of the album and that Percy Thrillington wasn't real.
As well as a showcase for the lyrics of Pete Brown who later went on to record the excellent 'Things may come and things may go but the art school dance goes on forever', the first album of this double set contains the excellent menacing 'Politician', of course the ever popular 'White Room' and could well have been an album in it's own right and was released as two separate albums as well as a double in the UK.

As for me, I'll keep listening to Tool and enjoying the masterpieces these guys have made. Sure, Tool isn't God, they're a band. But they're a damn good band. And this is a damn good album. The other reviewers (the ones that gave 5 star reviews, like it deserves) have put it well, so I'll let their words be an example for you. Listen to this album, with an open mind and open ears, and you'll find something that is beyond any scope of anything you've ever heard.

It is much more calm, and much more mature sounding. They didn't play any of the hard core songs like Strutter, but the songs they did play went great with the acoustic sound. Another thing I was surprised about was that Ace showed up! I was worried that he would have skipped out on this because of past relations with the band. The concert went great. The fans were cheering by the time it got to Rock N Roll All Nite, which also was a good acoustic version. So if you are interested, or already listening to KISS, you should definitely get this DVD or CD.

9406	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This dynamic live album is a masterpiece of arrangement and musicianship.  The songs on R&E reflect Zappa's love affair with the absurd.  Through this absurdity, however, emerges an album of astonishing sophistication.  Jaw-dropping musicianship and tightly-constructed instrumental interludes  blanket the album.  Zappa gets very bluesy and heavy on the R&E record.  "Penguin in Bondage", "More Trouble Every Day", and  "Son of Orange County" bring slinky rhythms, performed by a world  class rhythm section.  "Village of the Sun", one of the album's  many highlights, reveals a lovely vocal and pudding-like(!) texture.  PEOPLE OF AMERICA!  LISTEN TO ZAPPA!  YOU'LL LOVE IT!  IT'S A WAY OF LIFE!

I've had the album on vinyl and cassette, and wore both to the point of  disintergration, we'll see how long the CD lasts.  You can trace the story  behind this concept album through the song titles.  The music is  exceptional.  These nine songs complete an album so solid, nothing can  crack the wall.  The 53 second introduction that starts the album and title  track is legendary, I'm serious.  Every time I hear those opening notes  I'll have the reward of hearing "Hotel California".  Talk about a  well written song, and a classic.  It's incredible.  The intro, a complete  story, and a rocking ending.  It's obvious why this song was a #1 hit.  "A New Kid In Town" is brilliant.  Another #1 hit from this  incredible release.  "Life In The Fast Lane" rocks like nothing  else.  Besides that the lyrics are awesome, a third #1 for the album.  "Wasted Time" is a gorgeous ballad.  The lyrics are outstanding,  and the melody is strong.  The reprise following it is also beautiful.  The  melody is covered perfectly by the strings.  "Victim Of Love" is  a legendary rock song with incredible lyrics.  "Pretty Maids All In A  Row"  is terrific.  "Try And Love Again" is a great pop  song.  "The Last Resort" is a perfect gem.  This touching song  makes the perfect closing to this classic album.  The Eagles were never  this good again.  The time invested in this album resulted in an  extraordinary set opf songs, immaculate production, and an all around  amazing record.  Don't miss out, this album is essential for any rock  collection.  A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED MUST HAVE.  HOTEL CALIFORNIA is 43  minutes of pure enjoyment, a true rock classic.

Most of it is filmed in black and white for special effects, but it is none the less interesting and moving.  It goes back to the 80's right after the Joshua Tree CD and gives a glimpse of what U2 was about back then.  Bono provides a moving explanation of what Sunday Bloody Sunday is about that you may not find elsewhere if you are a U2 fan.  There is a strong deep bass track through the performances which sounds good on my subwoofer.  At a couple of points I could hear the bass amp speakers go into distortion close to blowing a speaker and also some bass feedback distortion like Jimi Hendrix, although I think this was unintentional for the song and accidentally made its way into a highly revealing master audio soundtrack.  Since it has dialog interspersed with the music, I don't listen to it as much as if it were a pure live performance, but it is a good insight to U2 as a band and as individuals and it is worth it for that.

It's the voices and harmonies that mattered when we first heard King and Taylor. The years have been kind to them. King's voice was always a little weathered, and that, for her, was a strength --- now, after failed marriages and whatever else life has slung at her, that roughness seems like the proof of experience. Taylor, a great singer in his 20s, is now a master; if you can hear a flaw, you've got better ears than I do.

Gorgeous record.
The highlights are the saloon medley arranged and conducted by Gordon Jenkins and SEND IN THE CLOWNS..also arranged by Jenkins.  Sinatra sings from deep within the heart, the pain and the sadness...and you can feel it.  The arrangements are superb and have the perfect amount of emotion like you would expect from Gordon Jenkins.
The 12 original songs from her 1964 album are here - produced amd arranged with sophistication (and perhaps a tad too much slickness) and taste in New York, though one might expect Nashville as the source.

Johnny sometimes wrote his own material and it is worth noting that of his own songs, It keeps right on a-hurting (one of his big American hits) has been covered by Elvis Presley.

As much as the music is ecumenical in its inspiration, it is equally ecumenical in its usage of musical instruments. Human musicians and the musics of various fauna species peacefully coexist in this joyous music. With only moderately careful listening, you can also experience the inventive coexistence of sitar, electric bass and a battery of world percussion with the more usual instruments in the Paul Winter Consort (if oboe, English horn, cello and pipe organ can be called "usual") as well as all of the outstanding singing by the remarkable Ms. Osborn and the chorus of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The electric bass riff in "The Promise of a Fisherman" (based on the Afro-Brazilian chant "Iemanja") stands out, and adds further testimony to Paul Winter's own musical ecumenicism.
A blu-ray reissue with the extra features I mentioned will make millions of dollars from millions of grateful fans.

It basically consists of Bono and Daniel Lanois going through the old master tapes and playing with the knobs and controls to hear things recorded that didn't make the final cut.

It opens with a montage of groups of Non-Western people dancing while DCD plays in the background. For most groups, this would come off as the  height of pretentiousness, but here it works.  The big pay off is the  concert footage. Lisa Gerrard's voice was in great shape on the nights that  they filmed this. The entire concert turns on two songs - "The wind  that shakes the barley" & "I am stretched at your grave and  will lie here forever." The only minus would be the interviews with  Lisa & Brendan Perry that are dropped in between every three or for  songs. But, hey, that why the remote has a button with FF on it.

Tellingly missing however, are Alexander McQueen's "Alarm Call" (a rainforest adventure with Bjork stranded on a raft) and Chris Cunningham's immortal "All Is Full Of Love" (you should know about that though), both of which can be found on a rare Japanese special edition, whilst "All" became the first pop promo to be released as a DVD single.
Overall,  the song selection is great. Seven of these songs (7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 18 and  23) were included in Dave Marsh's book "The Heart of Rock & Soul:  The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made." And with an unheard of 30  tracks, this collection is sure to satsify all fans of early pop music.  As  with the previous volume, the booklet is well done with lots of info on the  artists and the songs and the sound quality is excellent.  HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED
I've just added "Born in the USA" to the list because I've just "rediscovered" it. I've never really liked anything else Springsteen's done (including his current album) but this one's a stand-alone classic. ...
Since this CD was proclaimed as a sort  of reunion effort it would have been nice to see some contributions from  venerable "Danners" like Jeff "Skunk" Baxter, Denny  Diaz and Steve Gadd.

That's right... "Cook Of The House". Linda McCartney's lead vocal debut. It's just about as singularly awful as singularly awful can get. Linda's voice has no character, no inflection, no vibrato, no range, nothing. It's like getting your Aunt Lydia to sing a song. She won't embarass herself necessarily, but she has no business being on record. The song's subject matter is just goofy too; an insipid rockabilly number about what a mighty thunderbitch she is in the kitchen. This could be McCartney's low point as a solo artist, and we still have "Temporary Secretary" to get to three albums from now.

4809	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	After a 20 year absence, the "Dan" is back with their first studio album since "Gaucho", released in 1980. Little has changed in the "Dan" formula and what changes there are, are minor and in  the background. The lyrics are still clear and impressionistic with topics  ranging from intra-family relationships (Cousin Dupree) to yet another  autobiographical song about L.A. (West of Hollywood). The production is  purely top notch and polished. Gone, however are the "super session  players" of "Dan" albums of the past (with the exception of  Hugh McCracken and Dean Parks assisting with guitar duties on "Almost  Gothic" and "Negative Girl" respectively).  A pleasant  surprise on this album is Walter Becker's guitar playing, which now takes  center stage with the lack of all of the super-session guitarists of days  gone by (IE: Larry Carlton, Jeff "Skunk" Baxter to name two). As  for Don Fagen, his keyboard playing is outstanding as always, bouncing  between playing a Rhodes, Piano, Wurlitzur and on one occasion, an organ.  His style of playing flows between jazz and R & B. Another pleasant  surprise is found on the final trak of the CD, entitled "West of  Hollywood". Chris Potter's long tenor sax solo is reminiscent of Wayne  Shorter's solo on the title track to the 1977 album, "Aja".
Wheels of Fire in some respects is the ultimate Cream album, epitomising as it does the two faces of the band. On the one hand there is the song orientated side wherein Jack Bruce in particular could utilise his not inconsiderable writing talents and on the other is the performance based side where each of the band shone bur Clapton in particular. It was his playing which earned him the title of 'god' which adorned walls throughout the UK.

IF you haven't already heard this song from waaayyy back in the day, you've been deprived!  This track is convincing proof they don't make music like they used to.

The kids  get in the act with Joe singing "Where is Love" (from 'Oliver'),  Lorna singing "Santa Claus is Coming To Town" and Liza doing  "Steam Heat" (with her beaux!) and "Alice Blue Gown."

3. When I Think Of You

The next single was the #50 pop/#24 album rock-charting "Catch My Fall," a pulsing dance tune with a sax nonetheless.  Yet there are some signs of the fiercely individualism wanting some sort of support after a lifetime of experience: "I've traveled and unwound my own truth yeah/I've laid my head on the rock of youth yeah/I've trusted and then broken my own word/Just to keep me free in this mad, mad word."  The demo version is more stripped down and restrained, but not bad.
Spoonful is also on the live portion. Spoonful lasts 16 minutes and features a very long guitar solo as well as some great bass solos.

It's Joni in 1998, performing in the middle of a circular venue for a small, intimate audience. An interesting aspect you notice right away is that the crowd is sitting comfortably in different types of livingroom furniture, upholstered couches and chairs, situated on different levels throughout. The entrance to the fabricated venue is an art gallery of Joni Mitchell paintings for everyone to see while entering into the performance area, which is surrounded by her artwork as well.

Guitar, drums and bass play just perfect in order to reach these emotional states.

Judy had made a successful special in the spring of 1963 and CBS was hoping they had found lightning in a bottle to go up against "Bonanza," but the show never found a comfortable format until it was too late.  However, the reputation of the show's Christmas episode is untainted.  Judy is joined by her children Liza Minelli, Lorna Luft and Joey Luft, as well as singers Mel Torme and Jack Jones.  The musical highlights are Judy singing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" (her best holiday song), a duet with Torme doing his "Christmas Song," and, of course, Judy singing "Over the Rainbow" to her kids (both of her daughters have numbers in the show as well).  This is one of the few DVDs in this series that offer only one episode, but once you see this one you will understand why.  Final Note:  For a first rate account of what was happening on this show behind the scene you should check out Mel Torme's "The Other Side of the Rainbow."

Cyndi worked so hard to make it as a singer its hard to believe that she still is one of the most underrated artists of our time,madonna doesn't have half the talent that cyndi does and these new girls like dido and sarah maclachlan are way too overrated. I am glad that sony did put this dvd out, it is atreasure to have. What we need is cyndi lauper in paris on dvd and more help on getting her music back on the top 10 charts, maybe her new dance cd will do that. It would be sad if she becomes one of those established artists that doest get appreciated till she dies but than again the most gifted of talents live forever through their music like john lennon and janis joplin. I was so glad "im gonna be strong" is on the dvd because it proves how cyndi is as a gifted artist and being.

While there is much to like on AIU, I recommend this album on the strength of one tune: "I Have A Woman Inside My Soul" which is simply one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I especially love the backing vocals which have a recorded-in-the-empty-room-down-the-hall quality that gives the song a forlorn and melancholy feel. There are other nice moments on this one as well, most notably her valentine to John "I Want My Love To Rest Tonight" and the ominous album openers "Yang Yang" and "Death of Samantha". I sometimes get a laugh from "What A Mess", as well...on the other hand, there is still a fair amount of the kind of vocal acrobatics that Yoko-bashers love to hate, but it's kept to a minimum for the most part. If you've got the cash, get this, Feeling The Space and Fly and you'll have all the Yoko music you'll ever need.

For anybody who can remember watching this program when it originally aired on CBS-TV on Sunday night, December 22, 1963, I'm guessing that each one of you has a bit of a lump in your throat when re-watching this excellent DVD today, because you can no doubt recall very vividly the times in which it aired for the first time:  exactly one month after our President (John F. Kennedy) had been killed in Dallas.

 But the MGM concert is the selling point. The renditions are studio-quality. The highlights for me are "How Can You Mend A Broken Heart," and "I Started A Joke."

Special care was taken in the production.

NOW THE LIVE SIDE:
Though the album's draw for you may indeed be Incense & Peppermints (as it was for me), repeated playings will, I am sure, endear you to the myriad other songs on the album. One could argue that not every song here is a winner, in the sense that the radio should have played it. And yet, the music itself has a nostaligic flavor that simultaneously seems progressive -- almost alternative -- in its execution. Just listen to "Small Package." With its quote of ...; placed after a delightful guitar and organ passage a la Jethro Tull, you'll see just what I mean! I find it glorious to listen to.
While there are several singers who are also very capable actors presented here, most artists are concentrating on their singing. One also needs to consider that not only is it difficult to accompany what are essentially sung monologs with meaningful gestures, these performers normally performed on stage in large concert halls; thus their gestures and acting styles may seem exaggerated in the close-up medium of the camera.
The song set is the same as any of the previous versions.  The DVD arrangement is different.  The sound quality is actually just as good with the options of Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Surround; maybe better.  On my surround system, they all sounded good. There is a new segment of "An Audience with the Bee Gees" in a more intimate setting where they perform five good songs to an appreciative audience.  This is in stereo only.  There is a larger concert of this version available if you search.

It's really the album that got E-40 noticed by a mainstream audience, and pushed Jive to ultimately stuff more money into his forthcoming albums (the next being "Hall Of Game" [1996]). This album rides the line between independent and mainstream lines ridiculously well. As far as rapping goes, E-40 is at the very top of his game, boasting his slang-filled flow with a cunning wit, that is arguably in peak form. Most notably, some of the best west coast rappers came to support Forty's untouchable style - 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 - who all perform flawlessly on the classic posse track "Dusted 'n' Disgusted".

Hildegard's abbey possessed relics of St. Ursula, and Hildegard wrote many pieces in honour of the saint to be performed by the women of her abbey.  This particular recording of women's voices doing these pieces is therefore quite natural and back to the original intent of Hildegard's compositions.

7172	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I have been following R. Kelly from the get-go.  Here is a very talented individual who can do just about anything he sets his mind to.  We are lucky to have him in our cassette decks and compact disk players.  The lyrics are tastefully done and the production is of a high quality.  'Born Into The 90s' is mainly produced by R. Kelly, co-produced by Mr. Lee and Wayne Williams, and R. Kelly is assisted in the mixing and engineering department by Chris Trevett, Tom Vercillo, Cirland Noel, Stephen George, Pete Christensen, Gerard Julien, Rick Cruz, Tim Nitz, Doug Michael, Steve Levy, Timmy Allen, Jose Fernandez and a few others.  This album is very early in R. Kelly's career and is fresh and invigorating.  'She's Loving Me' is a funky track which is delicately layered with R. Kelly's versatile voice.  'Definition Of A Hotti' is another funky and uptempo track with R. Kelly kicking it in a new jack swing.  One must listen closely to R. Kelly, once you do this you will understand exactly what he is saying in this track.  E.g: 'R' says on this track: "Some honeys don't carry a purse, yeah it gets worse, check the second verse".  This simply means that some girls are so attractive to men that they don't need money;  the men will still foot the bill.  Track #7: "Slow Dance' is exactly what it says.  This track is a smooth slow jam made specifically for the slow jam sessions on the dance floor.  'R' is precisely in-tune with what makes a good dance song: whether it be a slow jam, more uptempo rhythm & bass, or uptempo new jack swing.  'R', as I like to affectionately refer to him, is one of my main influences in music as a whole.  Its hard to think what r&b would be like without R. Kelly.  The track entitled 'Dedicated' is a ballad which will be played at Weddings and Anniversaries of relationships for many decades to come, and is my personal favorite on this album.  All the tracks are additive and are worth listening to over and over again.  Dont pass up on this album.  Buy it, play it for your girl, and she will know that she is special.  Rest In Peace to Aaliyah, Peace to R. Kelly.

Not that Roxy is a grutitous art rock fest. "Penguin In Bondage" is fantasticly funky blues, and "Village Of The Sun" may have been the closest Zappa ever came to breezy jazz, although the chord changes demonstate this is no smooth muzak. The update of "Trouble Every Day" could be a Funkadelic track
The difference between this album and his last are night and day. You can hear how tight this band is, as they've played so much together over the last few years. The songs sound great, but not overproduced like so many rock albums these days (e.g. Daughtry). The drums sound like real drums and not coming from a computer, the guitar riffs sound raw, and the vocals are tight but not overdone.
Penny night or not, Miss Parker is already starting to fret that Zack will be a no-show. See they had had an argument last week about that "going steady" thing, that eternal love class ring- signifying thing, and Zack for the twenty-third, at least, time stormed off. And Penny for the twenty-second time made peace over the telephone, the midnight blues telephone. But you never knew with Zack. All Penny knew was she wanted him, wanted him bad, and wanted him here tonight to share her sweet sixteen-ness.
Shatner recreates the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, and then Romeo's pure love that could not go unspoken is transformed, in How Insensitive, into the implacable silence borne of a love that died - here is a man now asking himself how he could have reacted so emotionlessly and coldly to his once-significant other at the end of that long-ago love affair. The sounds of a bitter, desolate wind close out the final moments of the song, reinforcing the effect conveyed by Shatner's delivery. One of the more impassioned tracks on the album is Theme From Cyrano/Mr. Tambourine Man. Cyrano is a marvel of self-confidence; he has no desire to prostrate himself before others or to do anything that is not motivated by true art. After the transition to Mr. Tambourine Man, we find a man prostrate with inaction, desperately chasing after Mr. Tambourine Man in hopes of going anywhere and doing anything at all. The famous and much-mocked final lines convey a sense of desperation so deep that it can no longer remain quiet.

Like Freak Out, there's something in it for everyone: musique concrete (the title track), blues (Directly From My Heart To You), Rock (My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama), guitar-oriented music (Get A Little) and bit of 20th century classical (The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbeque).



The arrangements here are just what you'd expect when you think of songs like "My Funny Valentine," "Bewitched," and "Time After Time"...warm strings, jazzy piano flourishes, brushed drums, etc. And while it may seem a bit too mannered for some in its resistance of trying something new (save for an inventive EWI solo on the melancholy "When Your Lover Has Gone"), any fan of these songs or Carly's rich, one-of-a-kind voice will no doubt love this project. You can't argue the quality of material, and Simon's performances are filled with an obvious affection for the songs, adding another layer to the warm emotion always present in her singing.  She also knows what Ronstandt didn't, which is when to vocally hold back and when to pull out all the stops. Ronstandt had a fondness on her standards albums for belting out notes in the middle of lines sporadically throughout a song, as if more attention was to be paid to her technical ability instead of the song itself. Thankfully, Simon knows when it comes to songs as time-tested as these, you are certainly no better than the material. As a result, "By Myself/I See Your Face Before Me" and "Something Wonderful" are tastefully and appropriately understated, while the breathtaking "Danny Boy" bursts with emotion that is forceful but not forced.
  8. His Hand In Mine
Billie Holiday was an artist capable of expressing happiness and sadness - in her short life she had recorded some amazingly happy, bouncy swinging songs and later some devastatingly sad material, covering the whole gamut of human's experiences. On the other hand, Etta James was a blues/R&B shouter known for her soulful growling and though she did occasionally reach out into old "songbook" repertoire (after all, her biggest hit "At Last" was ancient 1930s ballad updated for R&B market) she would rely on rhythm and shouting to get the point. The only connecting link between these two singers is actually Etta James's mother who was big fan and played her recordings at home when young girl was growing up. So now, decades later, Etta is paying tribute to both women on album of late-night ballads focused entirely on heartbreak. Obviously that was Billie Holiday for her. Very one-sided. Like Billie never sung happy note in her life. The album was actually big success and got her "Grammy" (and side-lined her career into several similar albums) but I don't care much for this - Etta James sounds old,tired and weary - perhaps the biggest surprise was the fact that she actually toned down her typical growling for a moment. It's not a pleasant listening (despite fine music background) and it bothers me to see how people perceive Billie Holiday as only and exclusively sad, destroyed woman when in fact I know and love many of her uptempo music. Billie was NOT a victim, she was a strong woman who enjoyed life, smoked, drank and had a fist-fights when inspired - the fact that this album focuses only on sad ballads from her repertoire is like if Hollywood makes movie about your life and describes you only in very basic terms,like the street where you lived and supermarket where you bought your food but leaves out everything else. Come to think of it, it already happen when Hollywood made movie about Billie's life and just mangled everything. People who knew Billie were actually very upset.
This is an album I enjoyed and I'm not looking for more by EJ.

I appreciate this and their efforts to duplicate their classics here meet with much success. Particularly amazing is Robin's haunting, gorgeous vocal on "I Started a Joke," one of the great Bee Gees of all time. Similarly impressive is "New York Mining Disaster," which shows the brothers still had the ability to harmonize beautifully.

There is no political message to this album.  The theme isn't even particularly political in nature.  This is a collection of songs about dissolution and disintegration (entropy would be the more correct term).  In one form or another, every entry on Born in the U.S.A. explores the death of something, be it the lusty fire of a marriage grown cold ("I'm Goin' Down") or the erosion of the American small town ("My Hometown").

Not long after watching the Elevation concert DVD I went out and purchased POP (and also the videos of Zoo TV, the Joshua Tree, and the Unforgettable Fire).  A lot of U2 fans have marked Pop as being the "dud" of the band's several releases, but I actually found it interesting.  This concert video was a great watch also.  Nothing compared to Elevation but it's still a fantastic show.
So, now that I have given my 2 cents worth, for each song, I feel that you should go and buy this DVD. Bjork is really the most original female artist I've ever heard of.

712	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Even though this musical doesn't make its debut on Broadway until next year, it's already winning over audiences in London's famed West End. Hailed as "The greatest British musical" by The London Telegraph and "The first musical since `Rent' to exert such a complete emotional hold on its audience" by The New York Times, Billy Elliot is likely to become Elton John's greatest hit! If the musical's dialog is nearly as brilliant as this score, this play is destined to become the toast of Broadway and an instant classic come 2007. The music alone already is. The story is taken from the beautiful 2001 film and John's music compliments as it swells and takes us on a journey that you hope never ends. Of course, the beauty of this is that when it does end, just push "play" and repeat the experience all over again. The production of this CD is flawless and the Collector's Edition comes with a bonus CD that boasts Sir Elton on three of the best tracks, "The Letter," "Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher" and "Electricity." The title of that final track is most appropriate for this musical record that is absolutely radiant and sure to capture your heart instantly. Elton John's talents are endless and this latest installment of his work is extraordinary.
Madman Across the Water: 9/10
"Eyes Without A Face" is where the overproduction trap starts to really rear its head--primarily a ballad, it's quite pretty actually, with really nice chord changes, but it gets carried away with distracting electronic percussion; plus the 'rocking' mid-section feels underwritten and out of place. The watery synths on the chorus of "Blue Highway" give a distressing mid-'80s corporate rock feel to a song that already sounds pretty generic in the first place. "Catch My Fall" is also arranged unflatteringly, with bland synthesizer, saxophone, and drowned-out rhythm guitars. And the original album's last track, "The Dead Next Door", is a dreary, tedious mood piece.
Verdict: This is a good album and good place to start if you are new to Skillet (This was my 1st Skillet album). A nice album but It's not as strong the 2nd half. If you are a fan of rock music or of music similar to Daughtry then you'll like this. (My initial thought was that it sounded similar to Daughtry.) A nice album indeed.

864	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	These sorts of records always seem to get made. Take a few members from different great bands. Does the name Asia sound familiar? If you got Slash in a band people are going to be interested. Plus there is the collective unconsciousness that is finely tuned into a second or third coming of Guns and Roses. The song "Big Machine" is the first signs of Velvet Revolver bring the big rock to the people. It is an interesting record all the way through and should appeal to those fans. I have seen them live and they are entertaining. But many ad hoc bands could be entertaining for a while. The question is whether Contraband is as good a record as the best of Guns and Roses and Stone Temple Pilots? Or is this just another Audioslave? Is it a marketing gimmick?

A quick note for fans--the initial batch release has the discs mislabeled. The "bonus" disc is actually B&C. This is also the case with Brutal Youth (another underrated album in EC's catalog and, yes, essential).
6820	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	I only own a few of Paul's albums on CD, 'McCartney', 'McCartney II' (the oft-scorned '80s synth album; it ain't that bad now, folks) an' then this one, an' man I honestly feel for him when it comes to the kind of attention his solo output gets, especially these early albums. He'd spent the preceding years having every young person in the world clinging to every sweeping, eloquent word he sang amidst the political and social turmoil of the late '60s, so its no wonder he retreated to the safe confines of his home and found his real joy being with his wife knocking out little ditties that either meant nothing or meant too much for the public to get. I don't recall if my mom and dad ever played this specific record when I was a kid, but it sure sounds like the stuff they were playing, and when I look at ol' snapshots of them as young, hungry hippies I hear songs like 'Too Many People', 'Dear Boy', 'Eat at Home', 'Uncle Albert', an' all'a the others, in my head. I dug 'McCartney', but 'Ram' retained that one's intimacy an' accessibility while remaining jus' quirky an' out-of-step enough for my senses.

As much as Carlos Alomar is a good guitarist and the rest of the musicians there really is something missing without Woody, Dunbar, Ronson and Bolder. This album comes around the same time as their disbanding and a new group of musicians join Bowie.

The video footage is clear but the camera is not always where it should be and there are some cheesy video effects.

  Although the original Mothers had already disbanded by the time Zappa compiled and released WEENY in late 1969, the band's spirit is still evident in the sometimes jarring juxtaposition of styles, the insertion of brief "interlude" pieces between longer compositions and, inevitably, the humorous touches which adorn the album. Two doo-wop covers (a real rarity in Zappa's usually entirely self-composed musical universe), "WPLJ" and "Valarie," bookend WEENY beautifully, with Zappa proving as effective a pop vocalist as former Mother Ray Collins and bassist Roy Estrada providing a stunning falsetto on the latter tune. In between these two worthy tributes to 1950s teen culture are some far more "serious" works, most notably the eighteen-minute "Little House I Used to Live In," assembled from several studio sessions and a concert recorded in England, which features jaw-dropping violin work from Sugar Cane Harris (another hero of HOT RATS), piano fantasias from Underwood and Don Preston and - get this - an onstage organ solo by Zappa himself. The title track and "Holiday in Berlin, Full-Blown" give the leader a chance to display his guitar chops to good effect, while the various short numbers highlight different facets of his unique compositional bent. The result is an album nearly as impressive as, if somewhat less cohesive than, its esteemed predecessor, and one no fan of serious experimental music should be without.

One of the more recent additions is James Hunter, who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cry-Wilf/dp/B000HOJNI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cry Wilf!</a>).

DISC 2
6321	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I love this album for all the obvious reasons.  Classic songs, classic songs, classic performances. It's quite a genre they carved out for themselves, and on this release, it all came to fruition.  But I have one downer comment, for which I should apologize in advance.  Don Henley contributes not just one but two clinker songs.  We're talking below mediocre song writing on his two ballads.  'Wasted Time', 'Last Resort', and the precious 'Wasted Time Rerpise' are like barges of slow moving junk.  How did .. they ever get on the album?  And why does Don Henley sing on so many of these songs, he's not any better than the others?  He built in the foundation for his solo career, by working in crowd familiarity with his voice, but my suspicion is that he is in some respects leaching off the other talents.  Everything about this album seems like he'd seized control, which is a shame.  But, if it was his idea to drive this desperado hotel california theme, maybe it wasn't all in vain.  Take out those three songs, and this is easily one of the best rock albums ever.  Leave them in, and it STILL is, that's how good it is.
  Again, the clips alone cannot give you a true sence of the album. Make a gamble and get the album.

Today Billy Idol is seen as a guy who plays music for people who like to feel embarrassed. I think it's a shame personally, because his music is pretty fantastic, especially his popular songs. His songs are loaded with these irresistible beats and fun vocal hooks swimming all over the pool of 80's dance fun.
On all the tracks, the audio sounds great. The restored full screen video looks very good, the colors are more accurate, and there is a bit more definition and slightly finer details.

Disk two offers the 1946 MGM musical TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY and the documentary FRANK SINATRA: A RETROSPECTIVE.  TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY is not a Frank Sinatra film per se; it is a highly fictionalized biography of Broadway composer Jerome Kern that is heavy on musical numbers and as star-laden as only a 1940s MGM musical could be, with turns by Judy Garland, Lena Horne, and a host of others--including Frank Sinatra, who appears toward the end to perform, somewhat oddly, "Old Man River."  And while it will hardly tell Sinatra fans anything new about the star, the 65 minute RETROPSECTIVE is mildly entertaining and mildly enjoyable.

On the second side, the pieces are largely ambient in nature-- Eno's influence on this side is more than just coaxing brilliance out of the leader, this time he's more of an equal partner.  The pieces are pretty dark and haunted, the paranoia and claustrophobia now manifests itself directly throughout.  The pieces are all powerful and intriguing, although its closer "Subterraneans" that really takes it, a moody simple motif, it is dark and scary, I mean, really scary music of the kind you just don't hear.  It's placement after the (relatively) bright "Weeping Wall" only further accentuates this.

Like  "Two Virgins" and "Life With the Lions," this is yet  another example of avante garde baloney being falsely advertised and  offered to the public as music. Don't get me wrong, some avante garde  stuff, like "Revolution #9" on the "White Album" really  works.  However, the material contained on John and Yoko's three  "avante garde" recordings are nothing more than mindless dribble.

It is just me. Another one of my dreams fulfilled. I've always wanted to do a country record and here it is." Perhaps she was diplomatically holding back, or perhaps she truly felt this way but soured on the record within the next year, but in a 1998 ROLLING STONE interview, she bitterly disowned this recording. She criticized everything from the production to the photo on the cover (to my nearly ten-years-past recollection, her descriptive phrase was something like "a picture of me with a shawl around my neck, looking like some sad old woman who's about to go make spaghetti"). She seemed disappointed and resentful that the label initially had supported her in her desire to make a country record, but then backed away from that concept in the event (more below on the specifics of this).

But what makes this CD great is how the music flows together. If you sit back and close your eyes you can almost imagine you are at a concert. The range of musical styles varies from piece to piece, including upbeat songs like "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" & "Carol of the Bells" to the soft and beautiful "Veni Veni" & "Greensleeves." But my favorite here is "O Holy Night." It is by far the best instrumental version I have ever listened to, and better than most vocal arrangements.

Donnagio's score for CARRIE is, not surprisingly, very reminiscent of Herrmann's work for Hitchcock (particularly PSYCHO), but there are elements of Stravinsky (as there were for John Williams' JAWS score) as well.  The two songs on the album, as done by Katie Irving, are very pleasant and melancholic ballads that only Linda Ronstadt could have done better.  But Donnagio was wise to have seen CARRIE, as have many of the movie's viewers, as a dramatic tragedy as much as it is a psychological horror film.  His score reflects that belief very well.

This disk is a "time machine."  It takes one back to performances only dimly remembered by those who were there.  It shows performance practice, set design, and acting style of an earlier era before Opera was affected by television and the "international" styles.

I'm unapologetic about my belief that rock reached its peak a few decades ago and it's been downhill ever since. I've never given up hope but it gets harder and harder every year to keep the faith. Fortunately, just when I'm about to give up there comes along a gem like this to keep me believing that it may still have some life in it. In the early '90's, just when things looked really bleak, something magic happened in the Fall of '91, when "Girlfriend," Mazzy Star's "She Hangs Brightly," Primal Scream's "Screamadelica" and "Nevermind" were all released within 2 months of each other. For a brief moment in time, I wanted to believe again but the record companies and radio stations, in their infinite wisdom, figured what we REALLY wanted was more Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer and Madonna. There's nothing truly groundbreaking about "Girlfriend". It didn't change anything and it probably didn't influence anybody to give up their day jobs and get the band back together. The 5-star reviews aren't about that. They're for the simple joy of a well-written song, nice harmonies and for acknowledgement that someone cared enough to make a whole album of memorable, life-affirming music. If that makes you want to puke, stick to your Linkin Park or Fiddy Cent.

There is an intimacy on this stage that is rarely captured and the big name performers playing with Orbison, show their obvious admiration and respect for this talented man. A great DVD set and there are several versions with DVD and Super Audio or DVD audio. Treat yourself and buy this set! You won't be disappointed!

Every time you hear something from this album, it's some yeahoo DJ dropping a few bars from Mr. Tambourine Man on his show and getting a cheap laugh from the dork sidekick. What these people miss is the unique concept of this album. The tracks here are arranged to present different moods and attitudes juxtaposed. For example: The Theme From Cyrano vs. Mr. T-Man. The character Cyrano extols the virtues of self reliance and inward honesty for one's art. Followed-up by Mr. T-Man's junkie narrator who is continually looking for his fix from the jingle jangle dealer, the Tambourine Man. He needs his fix to get by. Every track except the final title track follow this construct.

"Son of Orange County/More Trouble Everyday" alone is worth the price of purchase.  In general, the period between 1972 and 1982 is his best work, in my opinion.  Try "Bongo Fury" too.  For what is an entree of Zappa without a surfeit second dish of Captain Beefheart?  Just try not to "freak out," OK?
I frankly am not too sure what it would be like to experience this album as someone born after about 1970.  Some reviewers have said that it has too many 1960s "in jokes," but that's not really it.

Most of the songs are from either "The Dark Side of the Moon" or "A Momentary Lapse of Reason." Predictably, 'One of These Days' is the token song from the band's early era. Viewers like me who believe that "Momentary Lapse" is one of the most unappreciated discs in the Floydian discography will especially enjoy this musical and visual treat. The obvious comparison for this product is the "Pulse" DVD. While this captures Floyd touring for "A Momentary Lapse of Reason," "Pulse" showcases a full-length concert during the "The Division Bell" time period. Fans were starved for almost a decade to finally see Pink Floyd return to the stage. Moving past the legal squabbling, David Gilmour took this version of the band on tour with fresh new songs that over time became classics. Setting aside the controversial issues (who's band is it anyway - why does Gilmour seem ashamed of the band's earlier music and almost never play anything before 1973), this is a magical evening. If the viewer can move past the knit-picking and appreciate this for what it is, "Delicate Sound of Thunder" will provide great satisfaction.

Band 14: Lawrence Tibbett - 1935 (2:05) A segment from the movie "Metropolitan".  The 39 year old Tibbett shows off his fine figure and voice in a very mannered and choreographed performance of the "Chanson du Toreador" from Carmen.  The only problem, other than a lack of nuance in his singing, is that sleazy little mustache, which denotes different qualities to different observers - but none of them are admirable.

7564	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	It is a sacrilege that Samantha Fox is regarded as a joke, a topless model who had a bunch of hits. She did more than that. First of all only a couple of her huge hits were produced by Stock Aitken and Waterman, and obviously have not stood the test of time very well, they were very much a thing of their time. All the rest are respectable music tracks. He first album "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)" spawned 4 hit singles (Touch Me, Do Ya Do Ya, Hold On Tight, I'm All You Need) , and only "Hold On Tight" is a bit cheesy pop.
Those quibbles aside, of course Home is a great album overall. And if you already own it in a variety of formats, the best reason to buy this one is the informative and attractively illustrated booklet that accompanies the CD. The booklet is helpful to the listener in many ways, not least because it discusses each song. Overall, I think Salvo is doing a fine job on the PH remasters. I am certain to buy an example of each.

They have some of the most intelligent lyrics covering a WIDE range of topics, but most falling under the speaking out against injustices category. Its funny, all the patriots of america that chastise anti-flag for their message completely contradict themselves. They believe that we have all these freedoms in America, making it the best country in the world, such as FREEDOM OF SPEACH. You are taking that right away from people like us by chastising us, censoring us, threatening us, and committing acts of violence against us. So if you don't like their message, too bad. Deal with it. Because they'll never stop.

Blues is as much an emotion as it is a music style and the great play the blues with soul.  You will not be confusing Hound Dog with Robert Cray or Eric Clapton who are both better technically, but lack the raw soul needed to be great at the blues.  The Dog brings it as raw as anyone and that is what makes this is a great blues album. The rawness of this album it may not be as accessible for everyone. Would only suggest for folks already deep in the blues.  If you are looking for some great slide guitar that is a little more refined abd accessibile check out Lil' Ed and the Imperials.

4895	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	As the title of my review explains, this is a great rock album.  Anyone who loves hard rock music needs to get this album.  Even the ballads, such as the title track and the powerful "Prayer" are not the syrupy sweet tunes some Christian rock bands put on their albums just to get some airplay on Christian music stations.  Instead they are well-crafted, well-performed softer songs, and with John Schlitt on vocals, you know there will be some power behind the vocals.  Armed and Dangerous, Last Daze and Underground just rock, and there is plenty of strong guitarwork as well as the signature keyboards that have been around on every Petra album ever made, but which have had an extra zest to them since the Elefante brothers started producing.  Petra does not waltz around their message like some other modern "Christian" rock bands, so expect no holds barred on the lyrics, as always.  All in all, possibly the greatest Christian rock album of all time and one of the best rock albums, period.

It may take months or even years to fully absorb it, and you are well advised to start with Undertow if you have never heard any Tool before. Once you've internalised their earlier work, you can come to Aenima and spend quite some time with it. Otherwise, like some people tend to do, you may just write them off as a pretentious act who are terribly overrated by their fan base, which would be a big loss for you.
track---actually we had to change the track!  We were hoping more for highly relaxing music that flowed into "sleep".

This is in part due to the fact that Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots had never been struck as much of an orignal singer.  STP will forever be remembered as the butt of the grunge line-up.  They sounded like Pearl Jam on some albums, and Alice in Chains on others.  But STP is beside the point here.  Scott's presence only highlights the fact that the band sounds uninspired and unoriginal.  The tracks must have been rushed through the studio, because nothing shines at all.  None of the songs are that great.  Slither sounds like every song on the album, and even sounds uncannily like Set Me Free from the Hulk soundtrack last summer, which is also present on the album.
Look, white room, sunshine of your love and crossroads are great songs but songs weren't creams strong point. Cream was three great musicians that liked to jam out, and they are good at that.
  On the live disc two, in contrast, both Clapton, in his blazing electric blues take on Robert Johnson's "Crossroads" and his astonishing cover of Willie Dixon's "Spoonful," along with Ginger Baker's still amazing 15 minute solo on "Toad" make up for the weaknesses of disc one. Jack Bruce's athletic performance of his "Traintime" comes in a very close second.  Overall, the greatest numbers in the entire album are the rock classic "White Room" on disc one, and Eric Clapton's simply astonding performance of "Spoonful," on disc two, with his take on "Crossroads" and "Sitting on Top of the World" coming in a close second. Jack Bruce's "Deserted Cities of the Heart" is also notable.  So, it's uneven but it's great and essential. These two discs are "Wheels of Fire," indeed.

3. A sense of historical perspective. In particular, please remind us the concert took place in 1987 and what the political situation in southern Africa was at the time. After over twenty years in prison, Nelson Mandela still had almost four more years to rot. It would be seven years before he would become South Africa's President Mandela.

But, frankly, their albums were always "spotty" - some great tracks mixed with mediocre to crappy songs.
The highlight, of course, is the "Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)" song cycle. The first half has a sort of smokey cellar soul feel to it..or, claustrophobic gospel? My bad descriptions don't do the song justice. Great singing (very deep, lower register stuff in there), great piano, souring chorus. It gets a little blusey and more rockin' in the middle, then closes with a reprise of the first part. A glorious little package, for sure.
Politician - Cream get political on this song. It's a sleazy, bluesy, carnival type of song, with a cynical outlook towards those we elect. This song put to mind the story of "The Profumo Affair", which I had heard about when the movie "Scandal" was advertised some years back. Just looking up Wikipedia now, it does seem to have happened before this song was written, so perhaps 'inspiring' this song.  Features dual lead guitars and a bassy drum...double bass drum, perhaps?

Disc Two is slightly more varied in its content, but holds the same mood as Disc One, basically a performer and his backing band giving the audience a good, entertaining show. There are different incarnations of The Mothers in the series, but they are only represented here, in the 1970-1971 phase, with Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman as lead vocalists, and their critics notwithstanding, two very talented singers, and a couple really funny guys, at that. See "Playground Psychotics" for confirmation of this.
The 8-leaf foldout inlay with liner notes from TODD EVERETT gives us a good overview of his career and the formation of the album (the LPs artwork isn't here as its single sleeve wasn't much to look at in the first place) - but it's the sound that's the star here.

3435	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	After a long downhill run beginning in the 80's, Santana came back with unbelievable force into the music mainstream with the 1999 release Supernatural.  The album gave the band numerous Grammy Awards, and A LOT of recognition and a sort of rebirth of interest in the classic Santana songs.
I like this one a lot, but think that her next two efforts ("Sandy" and "Like An Old Fashioned Waltz)compell me more. But having Richard Thompson playing throughout, you really can't go wrong. The bonus tracks are good, too--especially the rocking "Walking The Floor Over You".
When I have parties, this is one of the DVDs that I put on to provide background sound and video. Everyone relates to these songs and this group. There's always a new story about a concert experience.
Here McCartney creates the album as tour program and, in  the process, reverts to the 50's formula for albums. ATSOS was clearly  created out of the odds and ends McCartney had floating around the studio  (or house) with no serious intent on creating a "great" album.  It's excuse for existence is the tour of America that followed its  release.
The arrangements are exquisite and put you in the Christmas mood.
Every song on "Born in the USA" were outtakes from "Nebraska" and vice versa. Even the b-sides were hits, and the outtakes have been played frequently on his tours. It's an unbelievable wealth of material from that period. I would love to see a box set documenting the journey from "Nebraska's" roots to the 4 hour marathon shows on the "Born in the USA" Tour, maybe also as a "Classic Albums" DVD.

It should have been a single for cryin' out loud..."the first guitar feedback single: "weasels ripped my flesh." Yeah, right. Only in a perfect world.
Their covers of songs like "I Got My Mojo" and "Roadrunner" I have always thought their weakest output. Their vocals simply do not fit the r&b style. But apart from these few exceptions, all their released material is first class.

8914	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This is usually considered the worst of the Berlin period Bowie/Eno albums, not least by the participants themselves, but it actually contains some the best SONGS of the three albums. How can any album which contains "Fantastic Voyage", "Yassassin", "Red Sails", "DJ", "Look Back In Anger", "Boys Keep Swinging" and "Red Money" be considered disappointing? Admittedly, "African Night Flight" suffers from a distinct lack of anything resembling a tune while "Move On" and "Repetition" are second string Bowie (tho the latter has very interesting and brave lyrics on domestic violence. Elsewhere, Bowie's magpie tendencies are on display, "Red Sails" is a pretty blatant steal of the Neu/Harmonia motorik style (in particular Harmonia's "Monza") but redeemed by Bowie's inventive melody and singing. Likewise, "Look Back In Anger" suggests Bowie had been listening as closely to the Walker Brothers' "Nite Flights" album as Scott Walker had been listening to "Low" and "Heroes"! Overall, the album has a surprisingly lean and sparse feel with Bowie's best ever rhythm section (Carlos Alomar/ Dennis Davis/ George Murray) as reliable as ever, Adrian Belew fills in as "stunt guitarist" in the absence of Robert Fripp, and almost out-Fripps the master on "Boys Keep Swinging"! Bowie and Eno contribute here and there too, in fact, there's more of Eno in a songwriting sense on this album than on either "Low" or "Heroes", odd as it's usually considered the least Enoesque of the trilogy. The bonus track, (the oddly titled) "I Pray Ole" is good if not essential, sounds to me as if it re-uses chords from another song (a typically Enoesque ploy) but the 1988 version of "Look Back In Anger" merely demonstrates how much less interesting Bowie was in 1988 compared with 1979....

9352	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This was one tight band. But, in an early instance of Zappa's doctoring of live material, "Roxy & Elsewhere" is partially a studio effort. Napoleon Murphy Brock's high vocals in "Cheepnis" are proof of this.  Further proof would be Volume Two of "You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore."  Vastly different arrangement, with no speeded-up vocal. The other instances are more subtle, but present, nonetheless. But I won't detract from this record. It really is good.
"Big Leg Emma" is a retread of a failed Mothers Of Invention single, much to this audience's delight. It's "bouncier" here, where the original sounds like something from the 1930's. "Sofa" - what can I say? Very beautiful gem from the early days, revisited on "One Size Fits All," and given new life here. This cuts into an ornate second version of "The Black Page," then Frank's long-time concert staple "The Torture Never Stops," then finally, a pairing-up of "The Purple Lagoon" and "Approximate." It's to be heard to be believed. There is some touch-up work in the studio, but the track itself, recorded live, like everything else here, captures the spectacle of a Frank Zappa concert, from the days when he still enjoyed performing live with live musicians.

Although it's not to everybody tastes, I've always been a fan of the avant garde and especially of John and Yoko's avant garde stuff. This album is probably my favorite of the three that they brought out in the late sixties, mainly because of Cambridge 1969.

Indian Sunset is the sleeper hit.  Great story that starts slowly and builds wonderfully.
bassist Duff McKagen, and drummer Matt Sorum (also former member of The Cult) are here, filled out with rhythm guitarist Dave Kushner and vocalist Weiland. The band recorded the song "Set Me Free" for the movie "Hulk" and the song fared better than the movie did, but the first album took a while to see a release because Weiland got busted for heroin during recording. When the album was released it got mixed reviews. People complained and complain about everything they can think of...The band isn't as good as STP or GN'R, the CD won't go into my Ipod, the CD is copy-protected. I'm here to say some good things about the album. I'm a huge fan of STP and GN'R. True, Velvet Revolver isn't (at this point) better than either band. Consider this, though. Both bands released 5 albums; this is the only Velvet Revolver album so far. In the future, This band could be better than both bands. Also, you can't judge a band by saying that the songs aren't as good as those of the previous. Judge the songs for how good they are and not how good they are compared to other ones. Comparing a song by a new band to a song by the older version of the band is like saying "Set Me Free" isn't as good as Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven." OK? All the songs on this album are great. They're all catchy and guitar driven. It's nice to hear Slash back in action. Weiland has always been one of my favorite vocalists, a singer with incredible range. My biggest complaint about the album is the lyrics. Not only is Weiland is a great vocalist, but also a great lyricist. He has written some of my favorite lyrics, either as a whole or in part. Examples include Wicked Garden, Wonderful, and I Got You. Here, his lyrics seem half-a**ed. The lyrics that I really like on the album are only because I can relate to some of the lines. If you're one of those people who don't like Scott Weiland, but love his lyrics and are only buying the album for those. Then you shouldn't get this album. Here, the songs are best judged by their arrangement. Here are the tracks and my opinions. If you're a fan of STP or GN'R, you definitely need to hear this album. For the record the two members of STP, The DeLeo Brothers, formed a band called Army of Anyone who released a terrific self-titled CD.

Anyway, this is a great band at their peak playing great rock and roll. Forget about what this disc is not and focus on the MUSIC. The MUSIC is what this dvd is suppossed to be about. Yes, the limitations of the dvd are a real pisser, but this concert is just shy of being 40 years old now. The band now has a replacement singer. Time marches on. Don't let the quality of this dvd keep you from enjoying a truely fantastic band who was caught peaking in their craft.
But unless you enjoy throwing the baby out with the proverbial bathwater, you have to give the Eagles, and this album in particular, its due. And if you haven't heard the DVD-Audio version in surround sound, then you need to. Awesome. Now, excuse me while I go online and purchase a pair of tickets to their current farewell tour. Anybody have a spare $400?
While the live disc is a tiny bit rough in sound quality, it is a must: to hear just how skilful these originators of "Heavy Rock" were - especially Eric Clapton on guitar; and, this version of "Crossroads" is so perfect in every way that it almost sounds like a studio recording.
The score by Sir Elton and Lee Hall is nearly flawless, with one great character driven number after another.  "The Stars Look Down" is a powerful opening, "Grandma's Song" and "He Could Be a Star" are heart felt, "Solidarity" features a tune that will repeat in your head for days and days.  However, the four numbers I found unforgettable were: "Electricty" - which finds Billy trying to explain what he feels when he dances; "The Letter" - an emotionally devastating ballad sung by Billy's dead mother; the absolutely joyous "Expressing Yourself" which partners Billy with his flamboyantly gay friend in a rant and rave against conformity; "Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher" is a rambunctious, infectious music hall number sung by the ensemble.  All of the performances, without exception, are top drawer.

7 - Bedtime Story

Track 5: (4:06) Primarily synthesized sounds for this classic drum song. It grows gradually much more majestic. Nice.
Then there is the whole deal with this being a "concept" album.  The story goes something like this.  God, who is apparently not as omniscient as we thought, sends an angel to Earth to bring back something to show that Christmas is still meaningful in this day and age.  (Isn't that similar to the plot of "Year Without a Santa Claus"?)  So the angel flies around the world listening in on Christmas carols.  He witnesses lands ravaged by war and other travesties, but he finally finds someone who really needs his help... a girl in New York who can't get home to visit her father.  The angel, in the guise of a little child in a seedy bar on Christmas Eve, convinces the bartender to give money to the girl, who is inexplicably standing around across the street (they never SAY she is a hooker), so that she can fly home.  Then the previously miserly bartender gives out free drinks to  people who are already at home in the bar.  That's right, the real meaning of Christmas is--- FREE ALCOHOL!

8858	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is the last of 3 albums Bowie did with Eno (his "Berlin" period, although this one was not recorded in Berlin.  This is my favorite one of the three, and possibly my favorite Bowie album period.  This one has no instrumental pieces, like on "Low" and "Heroes".  The first half of the album has a vague "travel" theme to it.  In several songs Bowie mixes in bits of African drumming or arabesque sounding string synthesizer sounds.  These are all rock or pop songs, but they are all "deconstructed" pop songs, because everything from the instrument sounds to the songs' construction is turned on its head, at least that's how it seemed in 1979.  This album features Adrian Belew on guitar making sounds that were basically unheard of at the time.  "DJ" and "Boys.." are highlights - absolutely brilliant, and Belew truly uses his guitar like a weapon on his solos.  The only really weak song is "Red Money", which is the music from Iggy Pop's "Sister Midnight" set to different (inferior) lyrics.  Fortunately it's at the end, so it's easy to skip that tune, but the rest is highly recommended.
UNBELEIVABLE TALENT!!!!
Fortunately, you can save yourself a lot of pain by going straight to Burnt Weeny Sandwich, easily one of Zappa's best, and most musically satisfying efforts.  You'll have to sit through WPLJ and Valerie, two short satirical bits of ersatz pop fluff.  These numbers are intended to be funny but get lost on the way, something that happens rather a lot in the wonderland of Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention.  But everything beyond that it smooth sailing.

The cast on this CD does a very good job. Billy is portrayed by Liam Mower, one of the three boys who were originally selected to play the role; due to the fact that one child actor could not do such a demanding job six nights plus two matinees a week. Liam has a voice of an angel and he deservedly won his Laurence Oliver award, becoming the youngest person ever to do so. His vocals transfer all of the characters actions and emotions in the perfect way. His grumpy and encouraging ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson, is played with much gusto by Haydn Gwynne, who puts on a great accent at that. Stephanie Putson evokes sadness with her short appearances as Billy's dead mum. Ultimately, it is the whole ensemble with these talented soloists that manages to deliver this touching story.
9818	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Low" markes a major artistic change in Bowie's musical cannon.
There  are some serious Zappa classic on this album -- notably  "Cheepnis," his hilarious but appreciative parody of low-budget  monster movies (". . . the monster, which the peasants in this area  call FRUNOBULAX . . . "); a redux version of FREAK OUT's "Trouble  Every Day," rendered this time out as a slow and bluesy number with an  achingly brilliant guitar solo; and the very, very long "Be-Bop Tango  (Of The Old Jazzmen's Church)," which occupied an entire album side on  the original LP and features both Zappa's signature "audience  participation" and some terrific keyboard-and-vocal work from George  Duke ("This is BEEEEEEEEEEEEE-bop, even though you think it doesn't  sound like that . . . ") -- plus some others I won't list  here.
Dave Grusin is joined by some of the finest studio musicians in creating one of the best Henry Mancini tributes: John Pattitucci (bass), Harvey Mason (drums), Russell Malone (guitar), Paulinho Da Costa (percussion), Tollak Ollestad (harmonica), Gary Grant (trumpet), Andrew Martin (trombone), Jerry Hey and the Hot Band, Dan Higgins, Tom Scott and Eric Marienthal (sax). Diana Krall did the vocals on "Dreamsville" and "Soldier In The Rain."
Sadly, a lot of misinformed "music critics" like to pass this off as a "vanity project" or a "novelty album", but the millions of real Shatner fans know what this album really is.  It is an album of such monumental emotional, spiritual, and artistic integrity that it ceases to be merely music.  Even calling this album a lowly title like "art" is doing it a grave injustice.  This is a gift from the heavens.  I could go on and on all day, but alas, the CD player beckons.  I must return.

Also appearing on the album are Sandy Denny and Ashley Hutchings, the former lead singer and co-founder of Fairport Convention respectively, and Linda Peters, whom Thompson would marry.  Two years later they would put out their first album together,  "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight," which is even better than this album.  Ultimately I think of Richard Thompson as being the male counterpart to Sandy Denny, as pre-eminent British folk singers who accomplished even more after they left Fairport Convention than they did when the group was making great albums like "Unhalfbricking" and "Liege & Leaf."
The results of the 4 lps are varied, each with highs and lows (a noticably sad low is John Coltrane's playing on these sides, as Trane was battling, and losing to, any number of addictions from alcohol to overeating...Trane would soon take a forced sabbatical to get his life in order and Sonny Rollins would join the group), but the overall feel of all these sides are relaxed, with the group enjoying themselves.

There's filler tracks like "Message to Harry Manback," "Intermission," and "Die Eeir Von Satan" that add next to nothing in terms of musical quality, in that they only pad out the running length of the album.

GnR is nothing without Slash and Duff. the new GnR is Axls last attempt at making himself feel special and feeding his gigantic ego that destroyed the greatest rock band in history.
The wasted opportunity here is 'Monkberry Moon Delight'. It is by far, the catchiest song on this set barring 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey', but he chose to produce a nonsensical lyric and a truly 'love it or hate it vocal'. This song had so much potential going for it, I just kind of cry when it comes on, knowing it'll never be what it could be.

7148	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	If you consider yourself a rap fan and do not own this andevery other BDP album then you are what one might call frontin'. Itmay sound a bit dated now with the predominance of drum tracks in poptoday, but nothing beats Material Love, or 100 Guns, or even theExhibits. This was rap in its purest form with KRS ..., et. alschooling current rap and rap generations to come.
The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat, but then moves into the crazy funked out "The Bumble".  E-40 rips this track to shreds, and the beat is bananas!  Definitely one of the most original beats I've heard in a while.  "Sideways" also has a tight bouncy beat, and E-40 and B-Legit trade lines on it with class.  Mac-Shawn does the chorus, clever lyricism on here too.  "Spittin'" has a heavy, sunny funk beat.  E-40 comes with a real nice intro at the beginning, but sounds nice throughout.  "Sprinkle Me" is a classic single, with a fun, sunny beat and Suga T (E-40's sister) guests on it.  They make a nice sibling team.  Sprinkle me mayne!  "Dusted And Disgusted" like everyone else says, is a CLASSIC posse cut.  It features Tupac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.  The way the beat changes is so dope.  E-40 holds his own against three other great emcees.  Part of the beat is a nice, laid-back one, and the other is a rough gangsta beat.  "One Love" is a nice light-hearted track where 40 gets personal.  Great line: "This ain't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap/This here is serious, more realistic than radio-shack".  Actually sounds like it could've been a huge hit even today.  "Smoke And Drink" has more of a Zapp sound to it.  E-40 raps really fast on it, but nicely, and the beat has this cool groove to it, and I love the refrain!  "They Ain't Know" is a slower song about street life and gettin' money.  The lyrics are worth listening to.  "Fed" has a GREAT bouncing bass beat, and E-40 rips it, the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else, it's catchy.  "H-i-Double-L" is a classic ode to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with 40.  The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car.  "Bootsee" is a tight funky track about a busta named "Bootsee".  I'm sure you're familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they're really just fakin' it.  "It's All Bad" is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subjects in life.  He knows the game well.

4257	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Despite the excellence of his movie roles and recordings (especially the Sinatra-Riddle  Capitol "concept" albums), Sinatra was rarely at his best on television--his was not the "cozy" personality the little tube seemed best suited for--the Perry Como, Andy Williams, even Dean Martin and certainly Fred Rogers comfortable type.  So a viewer has to choose from the limited Sinatra TV videography with care.  Avoid the compilations (numerous quickly-assembled collections, poorly documented, with inferior production values).  Place the Sinatra special with Ella and Jobim ("A Man and His Music") at the very top of the list.  The second is probably the newly released "Sinatra at the Sands '78", available only on the five-disc set "Sinatra-Vegas."  "Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back" belongs no higher than third.  It clearly offers better music than his "official" coming out of retirement at Madison Square Garden in 1974 ("The Main Event"), which was, truth be told, not an artistic triumph.  Sinatra was, as happens to all singers, not in good voice on the two nights during which the event was held (especially the second, a "live" Sunday night telecast that was "painful" for some of us to listen to-- twice, when the Monday morning detractors at work began "piling on."  Some of us even questioned if he was not overly hasty in his decision to come back).

Vets--Vietnam Vets in particular--talk about being frozen in time, stuck at 18.  They say the war is never far from them, and the friends they lost are always on their mind.  Springsteen and BORN IN THE USA appealed to them, I think, because the album doesn't make judgements; it simply observes that life's hard times, life's good times, and everyone you meet along the way stay with you, effect you, become you.
Certainly the titles are desirable.  Disk one features the 1954 SUDDENLY and the 1955 THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM.  The first concerns a psychotic holding a family hostage while planning to assasinate the president; the second concerns a heroin addict struggling to kick the habit.  Both were considered shockers in their day, and many consider that they offer some of Sinatra's finest work as a straight dramatic actor.

I don't think she was chubby, since weighing 120 pounds is healthy. She had so much life and energy (she never lost either). The opening which is "Dress You Up" works spectacularily. Though we know she's singing about a lover, Madonna dresses up the audience in her show. After that, she sang such songs as "Into The Groove," "Holiday," "Crazy For You," "Like A Virgin," "Material Girl," and a few others. She was really cute in her infamous wedding singing "Like A Virgin." Yep, she was wearing her full "Boy Toy" apparell. The show closed with "Material Girl," her most recent hit at the time. She performed the song in her Marilyn Monroe costume. She threw money out into the audience, and shouted "I don't need money! I need love!"

For years Bolan's status in the US has been that of one-hit wonder and cult hero, a mere footnote (albeit an important and critically respected one) in rock history; this re-release of "Born To Boogie" deserves to singlehandly put him right up there with Elvis, The Beatles, Hendrix and Zeppelin as a total rock icon.

Classic  jams like Award Tour, We Can Get Down, Electric Relaxation(my favorite  Tribe track ever), Oh My God, and Lyrics To Go, are as good today as they  were seven years ago when this album was released. For all hip hop fans  that do not own this album, shame on you. For new fans that want the hip  hop that was brought about during the "golden era" (92' to 96'),  pick this album up along with the rest of Tribes' classic albums.

If you haven't heard anything from this group you owe it to yourself to spend the $10 (or so) and take a chance.  Especially so if any of the above strikes a chord with you.

The brash title track alone is well worth the cover charge, the fiestiest, most soulful interpretation of HANK WILLIAMS since JOHN FOGERTY tackled JAMBALAYA (ON THE BAYOU) under the monicker BLUE RIDGE RANGERS. Slide guitar guru ELMORE JAMES is paid tribute three times, notably on a slinky, stone cold rendition of THE SKY IS CRYING, which STEVIE RAVE ON also unearthed a few years later. Rock and roll godfadda CHUCK BERRY gets a nod too, via the relative obscurity IT WASN'T ME, not the umpteenth take on JOHNNY B. GOODE or ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN, while "shave and a haircut" stomper WHO DO YOU LOVE is perhaps the meatiest rendition since BO DIDDLEY himself. THOROGOOD seldom strayed from the basic blooze rock template served up here for the next thirty years...for fans of brawling, in your face boogie, that's hardly bad news.
There are several hidden and long lost McCartney gems found here.  It's a sin that the absolutely rocking, throaty and gutsy "Beware My Love" has been forgotten by Paul when it comes time for things like the WINGSPAN album, which looks back at old career highlights.

I knew Lil Kim could rap from Player's Anthem and Get Money.  However when her debuted single hit 'No Time' hit the airwaves and video launched I knew this album would make Lil Kim a star.  Biggie gave Kim the right producers and writers, and allowed Kim to pen her own material as well.  The album is now 15 years old and is double platinum (the first female rapper to do this and then Missy thereafter).  The lyrical content was viewed as taboo for a female rapper at the time, but Kim was able to have the confidence and drive to not be ashamed of what she was rapping about.  Without her putting the blueprint to these daring songs I don't think a female rapper would be as ballsy to do it now.  I will say if you never heard this album please cope this.

Now we meet another young Dan girl. Or is it the sane one? Whether she is part Goth or just old-fashioned, she is definitely pure science with a splash of black cat. One might think she likes it on top. The old man does not believe anything she says, but he is taken with her anyway. I would say that Almost Gothic might be the template for their next album, Everything Must Go, as that album seems to be stylized like it. To me this is the best song on the album, and if you like it you should like the later Dan album.
Comparing this to the Repertoire release of 2003 it's clear that this remaster by Nick Robbins is from a better tape source--clarity is remarkable and there's better depth to the sound of the recording whereas the previous version sounded slightly veiled by comparison and had a tiny bit of distortion on one or two tracks. There is some peak limiting applied but, on the whole, this is a pretty good remaster.

Meanwhile over at Capitol, ENDLESS SUMMER was riding high. For this 20-song set, Capitol recycled some strong pre-PET SOUNDS material, and included album cuts of three singles. Mike Love helped with track selection and even suggested the LP's title. The album hit #1 nationwide and stayed on Billboard's LP chart for three years. Its strength of sales along with Capitol's follow-up, the #8 peaking Gold Record,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SPIRIT-OF-AMERICA/dp/B000LPD0SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SPIRIT OF AMERICA</a>&nbsp;(1975), literally revived the group's fortunes and coffers.
The Tribute concert is Yanni's greatest concert performance tour to date.  Venues include the Taj Mahal in India and The Forbidden City in China.  Not only are they exceptional venues, but Yanni was the first musician allowed to use them as a performance venue due to the quality of the music, his personality and excellent character.  Tribute includes two of the most amazing, uplifting and entertaining concerts I've ever seen.  I say that as a life-long musician myself who has personally worked on lighting, sound, staging and other technical aspects of bands like Journey, Stevie Wonder, and REO Speedwagon, and have myself performed at international venues.
Now I do not know the fates of the individual members of The Dubs but the music business was, and is, a fast turnover place and so they may have just had their few moments of glory and then went back to the plumbing business, some office job, or wound up on some Skid Row, a not infrequent fate for many one-hit wonders. But for that one moment, for that one almost perfect expression of a song moment, from the opening drum roll to the crescendo-ing mix of voices to that final dramatic fade out, The Dubs captured our attention before we headed off to the plumbing business, some office job, or wound up on Skid Row, a not uncommon fate for those of that generation who fought and bled in Vietnam or got catch up in their own personal drug traumas. It was no accident that the director George Lucas when he put together the mood frame work of American Graffiti included Could This Be Magic as part of the soundtrack.
"Sweat" kicks off with short line lyrics and heavy guitars that are a hallmark of the Black Sabbath school of hard rock. The riffs occasionally recall Led Zeppelin, and the topic of "Sweat" may also recall drug music of the 70s. In its own way retro, this song may be less than what you could make of it; it may just be a hard rock dream.

great. The next song is Hush. It is seemingly about censorship. The lyrics are interesting and are very angry. The bass line in the begginging is pretty cool, funky even. It really grows on you after a while. The next few songs, Part of Me, Cold and Ugly and Jerk Off are all live tracks. The recording of them is really good. I really like Cold and Ugly and Jerk Off. Jerk Off has particularly interesting lyrics about morality. The final and title track is my favorite. The chorus is very powerful. The lyrics seemingly deal with religion. The title is a take on Karl Marx's quote "Religion is the opiate of the masses. There is a pretty silly hidden track called the Gaping Lotus Experience at the tail end of Opiate. Its not really much of a song.

My only problem with this album is "Tengo Na Minchia Tanta" on disc 2. It sticks out like a sore thumb. It is so obviously recorded by Zappa in the 80's. A little side note here: I HATE Zappa's 80's sound, whether live or in the studio. The overdriven bass, the sterile drums, the awful keyboard work...ugh. You don't believe me, listen to something like "Them or Us" and then an album from earlier and you'll see what I mean. I don't know why it was included here; maybe a rough sketch was sitting around and Zappa decided to rerecord it when this was put on CD in '87. I don't know.
2010	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Oh, how I enjoy this "Christmas Show". I remember first borrowing this show when it was on "VHS" from a local library. I borrowed it, and borrowed it, and borrowed it. The last time I borrowed it, it wouldn't play. I was rather upset about that. But then I was delighted when I found it on DVD. The show opens with "Andy" singing: "It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year". There are dancers dancing all around him and mock gifts being carried back and forth across the stage. And there is even this delightful dog on there named "Cody". I've often wondered if that was "Andy's" dog? "Andy" continues his show with more delightful "Christmas Songs", with guest stars: "Lorrie Morgan" and The "Osmond Brothers". Throughout the show he change his outfits, further showing how stylish he was. He even sang songs with a stage full of children, with Santa Claus making his appearance, playing a saxophone. My favorite section of the show was when he was dancing with the "reindeer". That was beautifully done. "Lorrie Morgan" soon came on, wearing a beautiful white pants outfit with a stylish lace top, to sing a beautiful song called : "These Are A Few Of My Favorite Things", solo. Then she sang "Little Snow Girl" with "Andy". And last but not least she sang "White Christmas" with "Andy" and "The Osmond Brothers", which finishes up "Lorrie's" appearance on the show. "The Osmond Brothers" later sang a medley of "Here We Come A'Caroling/We Wish You A Merry Christmas" and "Happy Holidays" with "Andy". "The Osmond Brothers" also wore stylish suits changing into different suits when they came out to sing "Here We Come A'Caroling/We Wish You A Merry Christmas" and "Happy Holidays" with "Andy", finishing up their appearance on the show. There was playful joking between "Andy" and "Lorrie". And then with "Andy", "Lorrie" and "The Osmond Brothers", which brought laughter from the audience. Their songs were sprinkled with snow after they would finish singing. Andy then continues the show in yet another stylish suit, ending the show with "Oh Holy Night". The thing that I wish is that the show had been longer. I'm assuming it was because the show was live when it was being broadcast on "PBS". They were, at the time selling copies of the show on "VHS" and "CD's" of the soundtrack. I didn't discover the show until about four years after it had been broadcast. Every since I first saw this show I wanted to visit "Andy Williams Moon River Theater". Unfortunately "Andy Williams" has passed on, now. But he has left a legacy of music. Even though we will never get anything new again, other than anything he may have already recorded, I for one will remain a big fan of Andy Williams. This is a must buy. If you have not seen it, you won't waste your money. After viewing it that should be enough to convince you to add it to your Christmas Collection. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ALL AROUND CHRISTMAS SHOW. For me, "Christmas" just isn't complete without it.

This performance at Toronto's El Mocambo club captures the great Stevie Ray Vaughan at the top of his form during his rise to fame in 1983. The set list mostly covers the songs from his classic debut album Texas Flood. The show is a fairly short set of only 12 songs, but Stevie Ray and the band deliver each and every tune with a level of power, passion, and talent that is sorely needed in music today. Watching this man electrify an audience with his scorching, jaw-dropping guitar playing is one of the greatest thrills music has to offer. After kicking things off with two fiery blues instrumentals, Stevie and the band tear into a blistering performance of the Jimi Hendrix classic "Voo Doo Chile" that is superior to Jimi's recording of the song and will grab you by the throat with its intensity. It is the highlight of the show along with Vaughan's tour de force slow blues "Texas Flood" where he keeps you glued to your TV screen with those scorching, electrifying solos that still pack a punch after all these years. These two songs alone are worth the price of this DVD and rank among the hottest guitar performances ever filmed.

That said this edition has upped the amount of bonus tracks to NINE in addition to the original nine tracks of the 1972 version. Now we have 73 minutes of music (the first 6 bonus cuts are included on the 1992 deluxe edition)  and that alone is enough for Who-Freaks to shell out their money one more time. The uncovered tracks are: "Mary Jane" "I Always Say" & "Begin The Beguine." Well, firstly you can already find "Beguine" as part of Pete's "SCOOP" series so this is already out there elsewhere so it don't count as anything new, so we are now are down to two tracks we haven't  heard before, "Mary Jane" is a wierd little ditty with very strange - computer altered acoustic guitar and heartfelt singing from Pete. "I Always Say" gives Pete the chance to sing da blooze in a Mersybeat style, both tracks have escaped the Bootleggers, so they are both are released for the very first time.

This is staright forward rock-pop music with an easy to sing to tune and lyrics that are not that complicated and I must say that their is not all that much politics in it as many have stated. Yeah, sure there are some sentimental lines in Born in the USA but it is not like hiting you over the head with his rhetoric.

The booklet alone is worth the purchase price, but the music is excellent as well. Woody's recording career only went a little over ten years due to the coming of the Chorea in the early l950's, but he still laid down too many good tracks to be confined to one album. However, if you can only afford one of his releases, this is a wonderful choice. Second choice would be the re-issue of "Dust Bowl Ballads" on Buddah Records...this was his l940 "concept" album that has had a profound effect on folk, country and protest music ever since. Also, I have to recommend a book to Guthrie fans: "Woody, Cisco and Me" by Jim Longhi. It shows the slice of Woody's life that involved a few journeys on Merchant Marine ships during WWII. It is an essential companion piece to Joe Klein's "Life of Woody Guthrie."

  Starting out this set is "Camarillo Brillo",the closest thing to a standard issue California 70's boogie rock type song Frank Zappa ever did. Of course this is Frank Zappa we're talking about.

"50/50" comes right out at you with that exciting intersection of in the groove flamboyance of the funkier end of hard rock,and that's basically what the lyrics deal with as a character sketch as well. On the openly lustful "Dinah-Moe-Hum" it's jazz/funk/rock boogie type fusion all the way whereas "Zomby Woof" again comes at things from a more guitar oriented rockier end of fusion where Zappa himself moves up front in the musical mix.  is an alternately famous/infamous number here-a strong dynamic jazz fusion "Dirty Love where Zappa tells us,typically in an explicit manner of a sexual encounter involving a degree of beastiality.

It was released in 1988 and it was right away a huge success - in fact it was the first Bay Area rap album to sell a million copies (it sold more than a million, like many of Too Short's later albums). It is a real rap classic with Too $hort once again spitting nothing but mack game all over the album. Ask any true West Coast rap fan about songs like "I Ain't Trippin'", the classic cut "Don't Fight the Feeling", the hard hitting "Cusswords" or the pimp anthem "Pimp tha Hoe" and you'll see what I mean. The album is timeless. Never mind it's from about 13 years ago - it's tight every time I listen to it. Good music never really gets old. The album was way ahead of it's time. In the late 80's no other rapper was talkin' about pimpin' (unlike these days, where any sucka wanna-be playa claims he's a pimp), and musically the album impresses too. It's a must-have, period.

Non-LL news on this CD,songs like "Go See The Doctor","Do You Know What Time It Is?","Wild,Wild West","They Want Money" and "God Made Me Funke" puts his lyricism in high gear. Also the songs against LL are great rap tunes by K.M.D. But the listing of "Rise N' Shine" (which is NOT on MY CD,how 'bout yours?) and songs like the tired "No Respect" are reasons why a 4-star is all I can give him.

We all know who's "Knowledge Is King" K.M.D. You have nothing to prove to anyone. Wish you knew that then.
The irony about DePalma's selection of Donnagio to score CARRIE is that he originally wanted Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock's favorite composer, to do it.  But Herrmann's untimely death, coming just a few short hours after finishing recording his score for TAXI DRIVER, made DePalma look elsewhere.

" Not quite as folksy as James Taylor, or as soulful as  Carole King, or as earnest as Joni Mitchell, but an important artist to  have in your collection nonetheless.

"I'm The Slime" is almost identical to the version from NBC's "Saturday Night Live," with a verse delivered by announcer Don Pardo ("Live from New  York, it's Saturday Night!!!), leading into the instrumentals "Pound For A brown," "Manx Needs Women," and "The Black Page."

1688	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This performance captures Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble playing a smokin' set of tunes at Toronto's El Mocambo in late 1983. In this very intimate setting, Stevie, Whipper, and Tommy play a fantastic set, a type of performance that Stevie always gave. He starts out with two instrumentals, "Testify" and "So Excited" (my personal fave). Then he goes into Jimi Hendrix's classic "Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)". After burning through "Pride And Joy", he goes through Howlin' Wolf's "Tell Me" and Buddy Guy's "Mary Had A Little Lamb". Then, the show-stopper: "Texas Flood". Almost ten minutes of textbook blues-playing, culminating with him playing behind his back. Watching him play this song is like someone punching me in the gut. Then he plays behind his head for "Love Struck Baby" and does a great cover of John Lee Hooker's "Hug You, Squeeze You". Then he has his rock-star moment with Hendrix's "Third Stone From The Sun", beating his guitar, Number One, to death on the stage. It makes one realize why Number One looked the way it did. He encores with "Lenny", a performance so beautiful and so full of passion that it would melt the most hardened blues-purist's heart. SRV then concludes the performance with Lonnie Mack's "Wham!", then sets his guitar down, says "Thank you so very much, we got's to go", and he and Double Trouble leave the stage. This performance is so fiery and intense. There is no way to describe it. You'll just have to go out and buy it. GO AHEAD! BUY IT NOW! OR ELSE! LONG LIVE STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN!
These paraphrases are FIENDISHLY difficult to play -- but Hamelin makes them sound almost *easy*.  It would be one thing merely to be able to PLAY these paraphrases -- and some of us have the technique to pull it off; but Hamelin's technique is so completely secure that one hears the tonal coloring, the inner voices, the occasional canons and the utter musicality of the compositions which Godowsky obviously wants us to hear.
1629	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Stevie Ray is my favorite guitar player of all time. I saw him live three times and no one in my book is a better blues guitar than he is. With Stevie's guitar favorites being Albert King and Jimi Hendrix, among others, he took what he learned from them, added his own knowledge of the blues to it, and every song he played, he played his best on it. On this DVD his playing is first rate, his guitar solos are high powered and something to be admired, and appreciated. The recording is in a small club, the sound is excellent, the filming is excellent, and if you really love Stevie's playing like I do, then buy this DVD and watch Stevie Ray and his backup band, Double Trouble at their best.

All the elements of this record melt together so perfectly, it's almost as if it was meant to be.  From the eerie calmness to the rage generated in the vocals, to the perfectly placed pounding of the drums, the intense riffage and bass will completely devour your ever-wanted attention and tear into your soul and will not let up until that 78 minutes of well speant life is over.....and just when you thought you were content, TOOL provides more comprehend.
The next day I drove to the local flea market and bought this album for $1.98.  If I knew then what I know now, I would have paid 5,000 times that.  You see, Shatner is a talent that comes along once every dozen lifetimes.  It's like someone combined the musical talents of Jimi Hendrix, Mozart, Elvis, Beethoven, Frank Sinatra, and the Beatles, then multiplied it by 10,000.  The only person who is within driving distance of Shatner's brand of sonic divinity is David Hasselhoff.  Even if Michael Jordan was as good at music as he is basketball, he would look like a Gong Show contestant when compared to Shatner.
With this richness of musical talent, as you watch the cameras zoom in closer and tighter than you can imagine, you gain a sense of the intimacy of the Troubadour, you gain a fresh appreciation of these artists, and these classics.  You probably heard many most of these songs before, but may not have experienced these artists combining quite like this before now, with all these classic songs, and that's enough to take you all the way back, the further back you go, the more you want to reexperience it over and over.


I grew up with GNR in my ears and was hoping for a little more of that sound. The over all feel is much more STP with an amazing band. Slash's solos and the song arrangements are much more limited than anything GNR ever put out ... and lyrically it gets a bit repetitive.
It seems all his golden oldies have been included on this greatest hits album: "When the going gets tough", "Loverboy", "Get out of my dreams" and "Carribean Queen". And yes, "License to chill" is there, too. Plus some ballads, but I find them boring.

  I loved the fact that Bernadette Flynn (the "good" girl in the show) got to do her own solo dance in the middle of this. It really gave her a chance to shine. The new numbers played by the dueling violinists were lively and lovely at the same time. The costumes and sets for this show were much bigger and elaborate than those for the original show. I would EASILY say that for me, the combination of old music and new numbers with more elaborate and totally new dance sequences was wonderful to watch. It made certain that I did not feel I was watching "the same old show" done over again. There were just so many new things to see and to hear and to take in. I loved Michael Flatley's solo flute performance near the beginning of act two. Very lovely stuff. I must say though that for me the highlight was another chance to hear Anne Buckley sing. What a GOLDEN voice. So beautiful and tender, yet rich and deep and passionate. The three songs she did here were even better to me than the ones she sang in the original Lord Of The Dance show. Her version of "Marble Halls" to me was even better than Enya's rendition, which I had previously loved. Ms. Buckley  introduced me to the haunting love ballad "Carrickfergus" that had me reaching for my Kleenex even as I was wide-eyed and smiling from ear to ear. And the Gaelic piece she did (An Maigdean Mhara, if my memory serves correctly) was so beautiful that mere seconds after Ms. Buckley began to sing this number, my floodgates FLEW open and did not close for the full 3+ minutes of this song. Also I loved the fact that in this show instead of having just the green hooded cape for all three of her numbers, this time Anne got to wear three diffferent and very beautiful dresses, one for each song that she did (green, white, and gold). Exquisite costumes to fit with a stunning voice and an incredible beauty with great stage prescence. I for one cannot wait for her solo debut album.
Lyricist Keith Reid has said that the  album's thematic unity was not intentional, and that only in retrospect  does he realize how depressed he must have been at the time.  Consider  this: after writing four albums full of songs about death (with the sea as  an almost constant metaphor), he hardly ever dealt with this subject matter  again.  And though I hate to endorse the "suffer for your art"  notion, truth to tell, once he succeeded in working through this great  question that lay at the heart of all his early work, he quickly became  just a shadow of his former artistic self.  In a strange  way,  I think  that's testament to the power of the first four  Procol Harum albums, and  especially this,  the stunning climax and capstone.

Although I wasn't crazy about the Flaming Lips version of Smoke on The Water, every other name band and artist turns in an exceptional and killer performance! I like both the Chickenfoot and Glenn Hughes/Steve Vai versions of Highway Star and I really can't decide which one is better. Michael Anthony's bass playing and vocal screams are jaw dropping and I like that Steve Vai paid tribute to Jon Lord by playing a harmonized, Brian May-like version of Lord's Made In Japan organ introduction. And Glenn Hughes is a vocal dynamo on the song as well as on Maybe I'm A Leo. Metallica's version of When A Blind Man Cries is a real treat while BLS sound amazing on Pictures Of Home and Zakk Wylde's vocals have never sounded better. It is a great listen from start to finish, and I have to say it again that it makes a great companion set to the 40th Anniversary Machine Head remaster set. Re-machined is a tribute album that delivers and you won't be disappointed!

Strangely emotional it seems Shatner has actually achieved something that is incredibly original, possibly underestimated, but is certainly an experience. For this reason you will come away having lived through something that maybe should never have been, but was, and is.

As Bjork developed as an artist, her videos became more elaborate and more challenging. For example, the video to "Army Of Me," the first single from the "Post" album, is a brash and techno-industrial anthem which simply pounds along. Bjork drives along in an over-sized tanker truck. In a way, her voice is the machine she is driving - powerful and so overwhelming, coming from such a small and petite lady. The video to "Isobel" is beautifully shot in black and white by director Michael Gondry. Here Bjork sings the story of Isobel, a young girl who was born in the forest. Water is the primary feature in her world. Gondry uses water as a dreamy transition tool between scenes. Like many Gondry videos, Isobel's different realities blur, calling each world and reality into question. "It's Oh So Quiet" is easily Bjork's most famous song ever, and this is something which will (probably) never change. It's a shame that a lot of people only know Bjork for this song. I mean, it's a great song and I can see why it was so popular, but she has SO much more to offer. The video is amazing though, it has to be said. The choreography of this Broadway-style anthem became a pop culture staple of the Nineties.
"Blood and Chocolate" upon it's release in 1986 was not one of Elvis's album I returned to frequently. I'm now appreciating this album for what it truly is, a turning point for Elvis as he would round the corner with "Spike" one of his most interesting albums from my standpoint. Songs that have made their impression on me the most, the ones that I am surprised that I didn't appreciate them on first listening in 86 are "Blue Chair" "I Hope Your Happy Now" (a marvelous upbeat with cruel intent) "Home is Anywhere You Hang Your Head", "Battered Old Bird" ( performed with the Costello songwriting wit) and "Poor Old Napolean" (nice to clearly hear the voice of Mrs Costello, Cait O'Roirdan, former Pouge and musician in her own right.

The listener can set expectations by framing this not as a musical recording but as sound effects which require no readily apparent structure, skill or training to deliver.

Best cuts are the rock and rolling Poetry In Motion; the exultant True True Happiness; Pledging My Love; Without You;  the fast paced Cutie Pie; It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin, Johnny's self-penned  song which at first hearing gives the impression of being about losing a  girl but is actually a paean to his dead father; Send Me The Pillow; Hank  Williams' I Can't Help It and I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry; and Willie  Nelson's Funny How Time Slips Away.
In short, the dark and introspective "Imperial Bedroom" was a turning point for Elvis, final proof that he was at the crest of the still expanding wave of British writers that had begun emerging in the early 80's. It was likely the best album of 1982 as well.
Although you take for granted that the quality of the singing and the music will be first class, it is however, the excellence of the camera work and the editing that really makes this recording a cut above the rest. The video not only includes close-ups of all participants and many panoramic views both inside and outside the church, but it also seems to be able to capture the essence of the spirituality that the music and the surroundings are trying to convey. There are, for instance, several touchingly beautiful shots of  Bocelli and Chung together, both so enraptured by the music that they seem to be oblivious to their surroundings.

"Seen And Not Heard" sounds very, very similar to Kiss' "Heaven's On Fire" as far as the chorus goes, but it's also one of my personal favorites from this album.

Compliments of  my parents, I grew up listening to Robert Johnson, Son House, Charley  Patton, etc.  As I got older, I grew bored with pure blues.  Blind Willie  Johnson, for example, just used the same melody over and over again with  different lyrics. I turned to jazz, blues-influenced folk such as John  Fahey, and the occasional blues-based rock of modern geniuses like Chris  Whitley and Ben Harper.  Occasionally, I listen to jam bands like the  Allman Brothers or Widespread Panic, but that's about as close to pure I  blues as I usually get these days.  The only old blues that still holds my  attention comes from the odd-balls like Mississippi John Hurt and Skip  James. Then I heard Kelly Joe Phelps' "Shine Eyed Mister Zen" and  I had to re-evaluate my position.  I immediately went out and bought all  three of Phelps' albums, and I am currently collecting other albums on  which he makes guest appearances (one to note is Tony Furtado's "Roll  My Blues Away"- a wonderful blend of blues, folk, bluegrass, and even  some Celtic).  Phelps plays with such soul, technical skill and integrity  that he has restored my faith in blues.  I recently realized that the  difference between Phelps and the other blues revivalists (aside from  Phelps' preternatural skill) is that Phelps stays true to the sound and the  feel of blues, but his compositions are structured more like jazz.  Kelly  Joe Phelps is simply the best.

With his new avant-garde wife at his side -- and enough money in the bank to last a lifetime -- Lennon set about ruining his bank value so he could return to being a 'private citizen.' All three albums -- Two Virgins, Life With The Lions & Wedding Album -- are potent reminders of a simpler time when artists could experiment wildly (or just be very silly) and still get released and distributed (erm, somewhat). Rykodisc nicely duplicates the original packaging (except for an odd anachronistic sense of prudishness) and the remastered sound quality is, for 1967, pretty darn good.

Cletus is hilarious, the maniacally cheerful voices will be familiar to veteran Zappa listeners and can be heard on 200 Motels, Uncle Meat, and elsewhere.  This is Zappa you can hum on the way home.
"Low" is the first of three albums Bowie was  to record with Eno in the seventies, the two others being  "Heroes", and "Lodger". "Low" is not an  instantly accessible album. It demands your patience and attention, but  rewards generously. It contains a delightful mix of quirky pop tunes  sounding like vignettes of an altered state of mind, and eerie ambient  tracks filled with strange alien sounds. A feeling of loneliness and space  permeates through this album, not surprising since Bowie had gone to Berlin  to lead a quieter life and to keep a "Low" profile.
The New vaudeville band had appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show,had an interview with Walter Cronkite and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.

They do not contain all the original songs that were on their record plus there are no extras. This does. I recommend this to anyone that loved or even liked them. It's well worth the price and will surely bring back many fond and pleasnat memories. Give it a try especially if you like Swing or Big Band music. It's kinda old fashioned but with a twist. There was no ther group ever like them. Totally unique in everyway. I have not one complaint. Just praise!!!!!

5567	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is a review of the new remastered version. The 2011 edition has a much much better sound quality than older versions. The remaster greatly improves the sound! I am so pleased with this as this is a fantastic album. The old versions has very bad sound, veiled, muddy and dark. This new is not perfect, the treble might be a little to bright and it may lack a bit of bottom, but anyway now you can hear all the details of this great album. I've been waiting a long time for this remaster and luckily it is a vast improvment! I'm happy!

5. Cocoon - one of my favorites.  The scene of the entire video is a naked Bjork (somehow it doesn't seem graphic at all, more like she's wearing a body suit).  As she sings, red ribbons grow out of her nipples to encase her in a cocoon.  Very innovative and fresh.

I love to watch Sheryl rock out and my husband just likes to watch Sheryl! Seriously though, a must have for fans, and probably enjoyable for the casual listener. Crisp picture and sound, but no extra goodies. Bummer.
Igor Khoroshev makes a good Tony Kaye/Rick Wakeman, despite what purists may say.  His lack of stage presence is disappointing, however.  He seems too modest about his skills.  Billy Sherwood need not have been at the show at all.  No one but he could hear his guitar, except on rare instances such as Owner of a Lonely Heart and Cinema, and selected tracks from The Ladder.  He does, surprisingly, repeat a small solo during the performance of Awaken, however.  There are times when I would see Billy wailing away, soloing on his guitar, and all I could hear was Steve playing "rhythm guitar."  Such was the case in the middle portion of Yours is no Disgrace.
9860	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	After the extremes of "King Of America," "Punch The Clock," and "Imperial Bedroom," Elvis Costello made what he probably suspected people would conceive of as a typical "Elvis Costello and the Attractions" album. Nick Lowe came back on board and they threw subtlety to the wind for "Blood And Chocolate," Elvis Costello's angriest album since "This Year's Model." Fueled by his recent divorce and a few rancorous Hollywood romantic disasters, Elvis himself described the inspiration for most of this material as "Messing up my life so I could write stupid little songs about it."

Instead of the 'big concert' type of show, this is an intimate setting with just the 5 guys on barstools singing with only acoustic instruments behind them....sort of 'BSB' "Unplugged" if you will.  A few candid interview moments with the guys are interspursed.  Each of the 5 group members gets a chance to shine in a solo number, then they all come back together again.  Some familiar material and some new stuff only heard here.  I can't recommend this item strongly enough and hope they will consider doing another one day soon!!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I'd at least double it. AWESOME release.

The rest of the album is pleasant new jack, with "born into the '90s" being the best track, but the story of this set is the ballads. All of them were huge hits, as "honey love" and "slow dance" topped the r&b charts, while "dedicated" peaked at #9. They were quite impressive, and signaled kelly's true calling is to be an explicit balladeer (actually, his new jack persona wasn't as convincing). To the delight of his fans, he expanded on this sound in great fashion on his pioneering sophomore release, 12 play, and hasn't changed his formula since.

08. Pump Up the Bass: This tracks really competes for the top pick in my opinion. Jeff & Prince kick it old-school as they reminisce of the old days. Jeff pulls out all the stops here - dope cuts, ill samples, and incredible scratching. Ready Rock C stops by for a little human beat box action as well. Smith kicks some of his fastest and dopest rhymes on the CD here, also acting well as Jeff's hype man.
9145	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	This is a pretty good live album, the only reason it gets four stars and not five is because of "do you like my new car". It is funny the first few times, but gets old upon repeated listens. Overall a good buy
So What sounds pretty damn good and it's a good way to open the show.  Right from that into Creeping Death which always sounds cool live.  Then the boys go into the worst version of Sad But True they've probably ever done.  I always skip this because it's just...eww.  Ain't My Bitch sounds good live however, as do Hero of the Day and King Nothing.  Then they go into a pretty bad version of One where Kirk misses the start of his solo and James sounds...not very good.  Then, a nice little version of Fuel w/ alternate lyrics and as always, Fuel smokes live.  Then a bass/guitar doodle of My Friend of Misery and Sanitarium into a very good version of Nothing Else Matters.  Then Until It Sleeps comes in which I'm not a fan of personally, but it sounds good live.  Then good ol' Bellz kicks in and gets the place jumpin'.  Great live song and huge crowd pleaser every time.  Then, Wherever I May Roam which is good live, but I'm glad it's not a staple anymore.  Then...Fade to Black.  A GREAT version of Fade to Black at that.  Everybody nails their parts perfectly and the mood that is set is just awesome.  Then they play the Kill/Ride medley, which consists of parts of Ride the Lightning, No Remorse, Hit the Lights, The Four Horsemen, Seek and Destroy, and Fight Fire w/ Fire.  Then for the encore they come out with Last Caress into the first part of Master of Puppets, cutting out before the interlude, then segwaying into Enter Sandman.  At the end of Sandman is where the "stunts" come in.  Lots of pyro, explosions, lights cutting out, emergency workers w/ flashlights, and a guy on fire running across the stage.  Once all that's done, the PA system has actually collapsed so it looks like a little garage, which is lit by dozens of hanging light bulbs.  The last two songs for the night are Am I Evil? and a badly edited version of Motorbreath where Kirk is clearly using two different guitars.  Overall, it's all right.  Get S&M before you get this, or better yet, go see Metallica for yourself.
4120	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Joni Mitchell released only one all-original album after this concert (and two albums of covers), so this concert is something of a career retrospective.  Mitchell performs here with a minimal band in a small venue, so her singer-songwriter talent takes center stage.  The first half of the concert is a bit too sedate, but it picks up energy in the middle and sustains it through to the end.  Mitchell's guitar work is excellent, as usual.  Her voice had begun to take on a soft velvety quality that's well suited to her own particular, somewhat odd, signature vocal phrasings.  She really has come into her own here.  Joni Mitchell is an aquired taste; she's not for everyone  many of her most popular songs were bigger hits in the hands of other performers than in her own  so this DVD is really for her fans.
At the end of the trial, musicians certified that Furtwngler helped many people during Nazi era such as Hugo Strelitzer who declared:
Surely interludes of interesting instrumentals or electronic sounds that keep your ears open would have made this record alot better than it is.
Of course, Stevie  was heavily influenced by Albert King, and you can certainly hear "Albert" in many / some of his licks / riffs, however, Stevie seemed to put his own "fingerprints"  on the blues and make it his own.

7663	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Let's venture back to 1993 -1994, the last years of hip hop's golden age. It was during the early 90's when an enormous amount of hip-hop classics were shoved into ears of all hip hop heads. Extra Prolific's debut album Like It Should Be, is arguablly the most complete as well as consistent Hiero release to date. 93 Til is a classic album from the hiero camp as well. But Extra Prolific's album was meshed together more masterfully. The overall mood and tone that Like It Should Be sets is present and fluid throughout the entire album. This album is so ginuine in unique due to the fact that Snupe merges his Oaktown/H-Town laidback, smoothe, boastfulness, and pimp swagger with a beautiful sounscape supplied by Domino. This album was definitely ahead of it's time, and as a result it was widely slept on and rarely mentioned today. This is a pure gem. The source even rated this album as a 4 mic rating back in 94. No matter where you live, this album is something to ride to and just chill to. With tracks like "Brown Sugar", "In front of the kids", and "First Sermon" you can't go wrong. If you are a true hip hop head/purist, cop this album. you will thank yourself.

Baker Street came along at the perfect time for a song of this nature and CITY TO CITY hit the market with a perfect niche album that stands alone in a category all by itself.  Punk and New Wave were on the advent while Progressive Rock and Classic Rock were waning, and Disco was dying an unnatural death of defiant struggle.  Rock had fragmented into so many sub-genre it was nearly impossible to be a diehard fan of just about any effort.  Grease was King and the ruling houses were Eagles and Fleetwood Mac; Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen were standing tall on their own and The Who were releasing their final "great" album; John Lennon was on vacation and Paul McCartney was getting poor reviews.  1978 needed an injection.

But, upon giving it my full attention something magical happened and I was instantly  transported back in time when life seemed simpler and less distracting. No cell phones,no beepers,no internet,no ipods. When one had to actually place the music onto a turntable,marvel at the album jacket and its graphics  and read the words contained therein. The 180 gram vinyl is a technological marvel in the way you hear the music and is not sterile but, full of depth and nuance. Sadly something you don't hear in our electronic downloads. So my challenge to the masses is give "Old School" a chance. You won't be disappointed.


  The only DVD, that I am aware of, with quality Alanis performances is "The Paris Concert for Amnesty International." She gives great performances of "Baba", "Hand In My Pocket" and "Thank U."

 Madonna does not use any bad language or act inappropriate here. She is very family oriented in this performance. Skimpy outfits,but definetly PG on this one.
The Harry Simeone Chorale performs "Little Drummer Boy" most passionately; and The Four Seasons do a terrific job on "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town." "This Christmas" is yet another big highlight of the CD thanks to the genius of Donny Hathaway; and listen for "Christmas Serenade" by Bobby Maestro. Bobby really does this one up right! The Temptations deliver "Silent Night" with a lot of style; and it all holds its own very well. How's about that music for The Temptations' "Silent Night?" The CD ends with "Another Lonely New Year's Eve" by Jimmy Beaumont; Jimmy sings this very well and it leaves me wanting more!

The best ones here are "Baker Street", named after an actual street in London; "Right Down The Line"; and "Home And Dry", but several others are not far behind. Although some critics dismissed this album as sounding somewhat wimpy when it came out, I feel that, in an era of noise-rock, this is an example of true talent shining through.

That could seem too big a praise for a 26-minute EP, but it well deserves it. The band is here at its most energetic and emotional, but don't even think of comparing them to Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Korn or anything such, as it has got enough intelligence and depth to write a 20-page analysis of each song, with trademark Tool topics like hypocricy, religion, immorality, freedom and transcedent experiences. And if you like screaming, you certainly will love Maynard's vocals.

The drums are horrendously loud, the vocals are disjointed and sometimes nonexistent, and the synthesizers, which dominate the record, wash everything in an eerie dark cloud. But that is what makes it so special. No one had ever done some of the things Bowie did on this album (check out the snare drum on "New Town"), and that made it so groundbreaking.

The second half kicks off with the "Wasted Time (Reprise)" before rocking out again with "Victim of Love", the only track without overdubs at all. We slow down again with the first Joe Walsh vocal on an Eagles track with the ballad "Pretty Maids All In a Row" with Joe on piano and synthesizers. Randy's "Try and Love Again" is a mid-tempo song and would be a great way for Randy to finish his time with the band as he would leave in the summer of 1977. The closing "The Last Resort" is a great ballad and the lyrics are about the world destroying its environment and is a song that still holds up today.

3837	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	BJORK's Volumen is the Most ORIGINAL Collection of Videos! Bjrk is one of the very few artists today to create Original Music Videos. Her Videos are WORKS OF ART and seem to take you to a sort of Dream Like World. When you watch this collection of videos you see how ahead of her time BJORK truly is. I will give me personal review of each Video on this collection. HUMAN BEHAVIOUR -  The song was one of the first Electronica songs and the video is like a stuffed animal come to  life video. The video is amazing and has some of the most creative images to ever grace the Music Video Screen! VENUS IS A BOY - This song is a slower song than the previous and the video is not her best, but is brought to life by BJORK being in her kitchen and doing what she does best... creating something unique. Only she can make something so typical very entertaining to watch. PLAY DEAD - I had never seen this video untill I bought this DVD, and let me tell you it was a treat. This is a beautiful slow song from a movie. This song is more POP sounding than anything I have ever heard from Bjork in later days. The Video is very beautiful and you can see her emotion through her facial expressions when she raises her voice in song. One of the best songs on this collection. BIG TIME SENSUALITY - The song is a great mid-tempo electronic blast. This is the infamous video that has Bjork dancing around on the back of a trailor truck in downtown Times Square New York City. I have to say she was very brave to do all those hand and facial expressions and run around like a chicken without a head in front of all those people. The video is in Black and white and is a great video. VIOLENTLY HAPPY - The song is a beautiful song although it does get repetitive very quick. The video has Bjork and friends in a Rubber Room with her and a few others cutting there hair as the song continues to unfold. The video is a little darker than what we can expect from Bjork, but it is not a bad video. ARMY OF ME - This is one of the most creative videos I have ever seen. This has Bjork in a video with a future like set that has sort of a dream like feel to it. Bjork also seems to have issues as she blows up a building in the end of the video. This is hard to explain it. Watch it it is GREAT!ISOBEL - The song is a beautiful slow song that has a sort of classical meets electronica vibe. The video is in black and white and water once again so unique and hard to explain. Kind of like a dream where you turn your head one minute and things change and morph. Beautiful song and video. IT'S OH SO QUIET - The song is a nice slow song that is so much like a old Hollywood musical tune. The video also carries on the Hollywood Musical vibe as it has Bjork dancing and bursting in to song. This video is fun and was the reason Bjork got the staring Role in which she gave an AMAZING performance the movie DANVCER IN THE DARK which if you have not seen you really need to. HYPERBALLAD - This song and video are my favorite from Bjork. Now this song is more like a dream than any other video she has done. The video matches the song so well in which Bjork is dreaming and in her dream her character is taking on that of a Video Game character who is doing things only her dream world would allow her to do. When you close your eyes to this song I swear you feel like you leave this earth. The Most BEAUTIFUL, AMAZINGLY colorful video that Bjork has ever done. The closest thing to a dream you will ever experience while still being awake! POSSIBLY MAYBE - This is a slower song that has a heavy drum line with some awesome electronic sounds that kick in at the perfect moments making this one of the most relaxing songs. The video is almost as colorful as Hyperballad because of the Black light that seems to bring one of Bjorks outfits to amazing Neon life. What a sensual beautiful video. I MISS YOU -  The song has a tribal feel to it. The video has Bjork taking on a truly animated character dancing with a weird alien like thing and has her tearing him to bits. She also sports a Hot Pink/Redish hair style. Has a feel almost like Human Behaviour but not so dark. JOGA - This is an amazing song that truly combines Electronica with a classical feel to it. The video has some beautiful and colorful landscapes. Bjork is not in this video very much, but the computerized landscapes are breathtaking with this heartpounding number. BACHELORETTE - This song is another beautiful song with that same style of music as JOGA. The video is original as all her others and has Bjork getting her Book published and turned in to a play. This video is also filmed to make it look as if they she is performing in a play. Another Great video. HUNTER - This song is one of the most beautiful slow songs on this DVD. The video has Bjork sporting a bald look and as the song gets emotional so do her expressions which turn her in to what seems to look like a Robotic Polar Bear of the future. She has some of the most amazing facial expressions which seem to work perfect as she morphs in to the Polar Bear. Awesome video! This whole collection is truly the most ORIGINAL WORKS OF ART in Music Video I have ever seen. BJORK is a true ARTIST who seems to bring her videos to life as much as she does her songs. Only one other Artist can compare to BJORK when it comes to Original Music Videos and that is the Ween of Video herself, MADONNA. Who is also inspired by Bjork and calls her one of the true visionaries in modern music today. I say BUY he DVD Collection of BJORK Volumen and you will feel like you just got HOME!
For a time, in the early seventies, I grew tired of the extremely long 'Toad' workout by Ginger Baker, but in recent years, it seems one of the many stellar high points of the proceedings.

After Guns 'N Roses released the commercial and critical bomb "The Spaghetti Incident", Axl Rose and his band mates had different ideas about where the band should be heading, so the original instrumentalists disbanded with Axl Rose while Rose hired new instrumentalists. Meanwhile, Slash, Duff, Matt Sorum, and Dave Kushner set out to find a new singer, and their search even chronicled on VH1's "The Project". As if the stars had aligned, the Stone Temple Pilots had recently recorded the rather dull "Shangri-La-Dee-Da", which Scott Weiland was not very fond of, since it sounded more like a Barry Manilow album than the Grunge he originally was trying to do. So, after releasing the Greatest Hits compilation "Thank You", the Stone Temple Pilots officially disbanded. With Scott on the unemployed list, Slash and Weiland met in a club where they became fast friends. Then, after getting the band together, they immediately began jamming on a song that would eventually become "Slither". Around the radio's constant playing of "Slither" and all the buzz around this CD, will it hold up? Well, when you combine Guns 'N Roses style with the grungy sounds of Stone Temple Pilots, you get a combination that works throughout the album like a charm.

"Repetition" is a setback that  comes across as preachy.  The music is not strong and, while its theme  against wife beating is noble, it is also totally unsubtle.  But "Lodger"  recovers with its original closing song, "Red Money."  "Red Money" can best  be appreciated after listening to Iggy Pop's "Sister Midnight," which uses  the identical music and some of the same words.  This is the first and  probably best of many Bowie covers of Iggy songs.  I'm not sure either what  the song is about or what the point is about the different lyrics, but it  works.

The only song that I don't like is "Do You Like The Way" Everyone knows "Smooth" by heart now, but don't let it overshadow the other great tunes here. You have to listen to "Maria, Maria", "Corazon Espinado", "Put Your Lights On". These few songs here are probably the best known beside 'Smooth'. El Farol is one of the greatest instrumentals that has ever been recorded and is stands up their with all of Santana's other instrumentals such as "Europa", and "Samba Por Ti" I know this is probably nothing not heard before, but I hope this review helps.

He has always been in a class by himself and many offerings throughout his career have had built in quality. However, that said, there is just this undeniable quality to his early vocals that just enriches and entrances all who enter here. What is it exactly? Is it an English-southern drawl, soul driven mix or what? Whatever that quality is - it is so unique in his earlier recordings. This album is yet another fine example of it.

But unless you enjoy throwing the baby out with the proverbial bathwater, you have to give the Eagles, and this album in particular, its due.

In fact, "What a Shame About Me" sounds suspiciously like Kamakiriad's "Springtime," and the bass-line in "Janie Runaway" sounds like Kamakiriad's "Trans-island Skyway." For my money, Kamakiriad is the better album by a nose.

Instead of creating disposable promos, Bjork's videos are performance art pieces, as captivating and experimental as anything you might see in an art gallery. She has a knack for teaming with wonderful directors who share her vision and pioneering spirit. Some highlights of this stunning collection include "Human Behavior" (a playful, surreal fairy tale by Michael Gondry), It's Oh So Quiet (a post-modern musical extravaganza by Spike Jones), "I Miss You" (an animated wonderland by the artists behind Ren & Stimpy) and "All Is Full of Love" (a cybersexual saga by Chris Cunningham).

Back in the band are veteran members Gary Brooker on piano & vocals, Matthew Fisher on organ, Robin Trower on guitar, & lyricist Keith Reid. "The Prodigal Stranger" is a magnificent album, the band sounding so re-vitalized on these masterful, melodic songs. Not a bad tune among them. High points include the passionate "The Truth Won't Fade Away," the great rockers "Man With A Mission," "One More Time," "All Are Dreams Are Sold" & "Learn To Fly," the wonderfully catchy "Hand That Rocks The Cradle," and the beautiful "A Dream In Every Home," "King Of Hearts" (with a clever nod to "Whiter Shade Of Pale" in it's lyrics), and the finale, "The Pursuit Of Happiness." Gary Brooker's voice is still as strong as ever, as are the band's solid  musicianship & songwriting. "The Prodigal Stranger" is one of Procol Harum's greatest albums, and a true welcome return of one of rock's greatest bands.
The SOFAD songs suffer quite badly apart from I Feel You, they seem more and more like a summing up and they generally tend to be not that interesting ( save In Your Room which is actually a bit creepy ). Maybe I say this because I really don't like SOFAD because of little details that I'll keep to myself for now.

She also sings "For Once in My Lifetime" which I have never heard her sing before.  It is a show stopper.  Liza is fantastic if a bit giddy.  We can watch Mama Judy coaching her on stage and microphone technique in a very unsubtle and embarassing way.  But the whole thing is great.

This is not only very different from the previous album but very different from the last two albums with the Attractions before this. The best I can describe it is as something of a mid 80's updated mixture of the jerky new wave rhythms of his late 70's albums and some of the more carefully crafted pop/rock styled music of the early 80's. Taken individually the songs on this album are all highly melodic,tend towards the upbeat musically and have particularly biting and scatching lyrics even by Elvis Costello standards. One of the great things about Costello is his ability to express emotions such as betrayal,irritation and even anger without resorting to childish simplifications or witless cynicism. Much as John Lennon before him (perhaps even to a further degree) Costello can take a negative subject and intellectualize it to such an extent it pretty much becomes a more positive thought or,at least a more setttled one anyway. "Uncomplicated" opens the album with a harsh,agitated melody and guitar sound whereas "I Hope Your Happy Now","Home Is Anywhere You Hang Your Head" and even the conveniently possitioned "I Want You" all possess the rolling drums,jangly guitars and melodicism of mid 60's Beatles,part of the classic Attractions sound as it was. Later in the album you hear more elaboratly constructed songs such as the darkly textured "Battered Old Bird" and "Poor Napoleon",named after the alias he'd taken for this albums release. As with the previous album,even though this is more based in modern pop music than that had  been this album is still somewhat atypical of much of pop music of it's time. Because it in many ways anticipates the decades to come this album holds up a lot better in todays environment where with the exception of maybe REM at this point this may have seemed a bit different from most of what was commercially popular. It winds up a solid Elvis Costello/Attractions album regardless and is one of the finer releases from any period.
So after that, we get Paul back, right? Nope. Denny takes the mic again for "Time To Hide". He's got good range as a vocalist but his tone is strained. The track is actually pretty OK for the most part, and I'll admit the chorus is kinda catchy. But for all the guitar riffing and the harmonica solo, we're still in that 70s adult contemporary vibe. I mean look, "Cook Of The House" might be the worst song on the album (and the worst solo track McCartney has recorded so far), but at LEAST it's trying to be something different. Unfortunately, we take a turn into Gordon Lightfoot-meets-Samantha Strong territory with the pretty terrible "Must Do Something About It". We don't even get our Paul back; Joe English takes lead vocals on this track. Surprisingly, he has a stronger voice than both Laine or McCullough, and he's left with lesser material. Alas. The song is terrible. Not "Cook of the House" terrible, but pretty bad.

I mean the Best. OK, the Beast. Later lineups may have been tighter, more technically proficient, but they can't compare when it comes to musicality, which here is absolutely magical. Zappa sounds completely in control and yet totally relaxed. His furious solos, while blazing fast and sophisticated, are just a bit more soulful. There appears to be more space, air around the notes. Frank seems to be viscerally connecting to every moment, and his pleasure is palpable throughout. Not that any other album has him as anything but convivial, but the lively rhythms here are just so damn soul stirring. I credit much of this to the phenomenal drumming of Chester Thompson, who kept things nicely paced with such funkified beats.
If you want to see pure talent and charisma on stage this is the concert you should get. AMAZING! Madonna.

946	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	The much anticipated team up of Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland with former Guns 'N Roses members Slash, Duff, and Matt Sorum seemed like a better idea on paper than the actual product.  As a band, Velvet Revolver tries to blend both elements of STP and Guns 'N Roses with alternative hooks and power ballad melodies; but it doesn't mix.  "Set Me Free", a teaser track featured on last summer's Hulk soundtrack, is just that: a teaser of what kind of album "Contraband" could have been.  "Do It For the Kids" is a rocking track, but the power ballads are stale for the most part, and where are the thick and heavy guitar riffs from Slash that we all expected and hoped for?  It's still worth a listen, just don't expect anything as profound as the material that these guys have put out before.

The acting is great from the entire cast. The children are impressive as their characters change over time. They start of playful and happy, and end up deceptive and violent. You'll hate these kids for doing such an amazing job. It really is frustrating and infuriating. Some of the parents are completely delusional - blind to what is happening before their eyes. I think the adult actors did a good job portraying these feelings, although some was overacted. The makeup is great yet disturbing; the film is very graphic, bloody, and effective. In fact, it was unexpected considering how vivid the violence is when it involves the children. The music is also suitable, although a bit forgettable. The pace is ferocious, it'll be over before you know it.
"Punky's Whips" is a silly, yet incredibly well-crafted number about glam rocker Punky Meadows, originally left off the record's program by Warner Brothers out of fear of a libel/slander case. But Meadows liked the song; he thought it was funny. This was the beginning of a protracted legal battle that cost everyone involved a fortune. "Honey, Don't You Want A Man Like Me?" is probably the ultimate male chauvenist pig song, but it is played so well, one has to like it, as with the seemingly cruel "Illinois Enema Bandit."

What if signature prog-lite band the Alan Parsons Project did a Christmas album, after listening to all four Mannheim Steamroller holiday collections? The music here has the dynamic aspect the Steamers have over Al's Bunch, yet it follows the Parsons formula of mostly vocal songs--only a handful of songs here are instrumentals. Both this album and "Attic" follow another Parsons formula--that of the concept album. Put any two tracks from it on a compilation album and they would have the sampler effect--the listener ends up wondering where the rest of the story is. This material was written to be presented as a whole. But except for "Gaudi"--the story of the architect who designed the La Sagrata Familia cathedral in Madrid--Parsons material as a whole doesn't approach the symphonic level TSO does. Fortunately, TSO's latest is about Beethoven--you don't have to stash that one in your Christmas stuff in the basement. Maybe it's shapes of things to come--"a TSO for all seasons".

6434	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Elton continued his winning streak with this classic album, and this time around, the strings were put to good use. In my opinion, Tiny Dancer, Levon and Indian Sunset are pure brilliance, but it's a fairly short album, and the last three songs are below average, that's why I don't give five stars. As I said, this time, the strings almost define the songs, the powerfully dramatic Levon, the passionate Tiny Dancer, the moving Indian Sunset(the way the strings/percussion make you feel the anguish of this situation, extraordinary) and the sweet sensation of life on the road, Holiday Inn. While I think the title track is a decent song, it never has been one of my personal favorites, and I much prefer the guitar version on Rare Masters, and now Tumbleweed Connection. Another winning track is Razor Face, that is just classic, and should have received more attention. This album is a must, and probably about the third one you should get, after Don't Shoot Me, and Yellow Brick Road. I will end this with what I consider to be some of the finest Taupin lyrics to date: Jesus, he wants to go to venus, leaving Levon far behind, take a balloon, and go sailing, while Levon, Levon slowly dies...

In the end, though, Ram lacks the charm of its predecessor. Which doesn't mean it isn't a damn fine, listenable record. It'll particularly impress anyone who thinks Abbey Road is the best album ever, as it often recalls its more illustrious fellow. In fact, this is the most Beatlish album Paul would record for some time: Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey is similar to the 'mini-symphonies' of Abbey Road, Long-Haired Lady recalls Hey Jude, Dear Boy wouldn't have been out of place on the white album, and there's odd bits of whimsey like the Ram On banjo-led singalong. (The title, of course, is a pun on Paul's old Hamburg alias of Paul Ramon.) Elsewhere, Eat At Home and Back Seat Of My Car are heartfelt tributes to Buddy Holly and Brian Wilson respectively. A very endearing record that still replays listening.
You just need to have this. It may take you a couple listenings to fully appreciate the scope of Zappa's music up to that time (keep in mind, this is the edited version of what was to have been a 12-album set of the history of the Mothers!), but you will get it. (In fact, I can think of no better combination of albums to listen to back-to-back than "Weasels" and Little Feat's self-titled first album, which featured two Mothers that Frank had just fired prior to releasing this album.

By this 1990 concert Cale had put behind him some of the problems that contributed to a career that another reviewer correctly described as "uneven," and behavior that might be charitably described as "erratic."  He had more than twenty years of output to draw upon, so there is little "filler." Some of the songs are more effective than others (lyrically they range from musical settings of Dylan Thomas poems to free association doggerel).  The breath of themes and emotions traversed in these compositions is such that it would be surprising if they evoked uniform responses across listeners.  Different listeners will have different favorites.  I have mine. Not background music, this disk rewards serious listening.
The band really molds though and the album needs to be taken as a whole. The seperate tracks are really just peices of the whole performance. Even though some songs are listed with familiar names, like Willie The Pimp, they have their own formation into the groove. Some of the tracks trump the originals like HOUSE I USED TO LIVE, or the super tight version of PEACHES. Essentially this album exists though only to butter you up to do the mudshark. (ewww[...]

Diamond Dogs is based on George Orwell's 1984, and having read the book I can say that Bowie succeeded in relaying the emotions of the book through his music.  The atmosphere of the album is desperate and dark, with a few fun rockers thrown in to provide respite.  Unfortunately, while there are some classic moments here, a lot of the album is bogged down by awkward song structures and instrumental delivery.  The production (or the remastering) is shoddy, and on the first few listens this flaw is almost startling.  Once you become accustomed to the sound, the album really begins to reward you with some excellent songs.  Diamond Dogs could really have used a good lead guitarist however.  Bowie does a respectable job and brings some interesting sounds to the table for tracks like Diamond Dogs and Sweet Thing but some songs could use an extra kick in the pants that Bowie just can't provide on guitar by himself.


The solid Steely Dan fans probably all have this one by now, but if not, you could do (a lot) worse with much of today's music. At least these guys still write interesting lyrics.
  This was actually done when George was in WHAM! This song was a classic back then. It is a classic today. It will remain a classic in the future and then on. Everyone knows it. The concept of the video fits the song perfectly because the concept of the video shows what is being sung in the song. Great video.

I've heard him outside of GnR on a few one-off projects (Hendrix tribute and Muddy Waters tribute), and the solos sounded the same and stale.

I was wrong. Sure,the songs aren't as melodic as slash and duff's previous work with the gunners,(with the exception of Fall To Pieces and Loving The Alien).Nonetheless,the geeeetarz sound very live and not too polished. Scott's lyrics are simply astounding and at the same time they should maintain a real personal and deep meaning to any listener. And he actually sings,no screaming here. His voice truly transcends his work with STP,primarily due to the fact that this band has a much more solid chemistry. The only downside to the album IMO,is just the whole dark feel the album has. As personal and real as Scott's lyrics are,I hope the band could contribute more songwriting,rather than making future VR albums nothing but autobiographicals of Scott. Also,it wouldn't hurt for the band to get a bit more melodic. On tracks like Fall To Pieces,Loving The Alien,and Dirty Little Thing,the band shows they are truly capable of this. Other than that,the album rocks and every song kicks major rock n roll booty.

Sweat- good song, 5/5.
-The chemistry among the three outstanding musicians: Sting and Stewart Copeland's discords eventually broke up the band. Ironically, they did look like amicable partners in their early videos when they swung together with privities. Any Summers was older than the two, yet his ridiculous expressions at times perfectly entertains the audience. On the other hand, we gain the access to see Andy's mastery of guitars, Sting's excellence of composing and playing the bass, and Stewart's passion for drumming in the making of "Ghost in the Machine." If not detailed, the scenes are new to juvenile appreciators like me who are too young to have witnessed the peak of their fame.
It avoids one or two songs from their large catalogue which may have been OK at the time, but don't sound so good now.

860	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	A few months ago I caught a video on VH1 by Antigone Rising just as I was getting ready for work. I believe the video was for "Don't Look Back". I just loved the harmonies and the catchy melodies. I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying this song because my taste in music is usually off the beaten path from the mainstream. Plus I am not really a fan of country/rock music. I eventually found an early copy of the band's live performance and decided to take a risk and buy it. I really am not much of a country/rock fan. A lot of the music I heard on "From the Ground Up" has a lot of country music influence. I find most country music irritating and most rock music rather dull. Thank heavens I cannot say that Antigone Rising's music is irritating or dull. The music is a good blend of rock and country. I thought it was interesting that Antigone Rising would work with Starbucks Coffee to put out a live album I(in a studio session with a few fans is more like it). Good way to introduce their music to new fans like myself. I like how raw and unpolished Cassidy's vocals are. Most of the songs I liked. I did think that "Happy Home" was a bit too twangy for my tastes. Singer Cassidy reminded me of Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines whose voice I find rather grating. A lot of the songs on the album tends to go into country more times than I cared to listen to. There are moments when the guitars veer off into the twangy side of country music which I found rather annoying. I wasn't terribly impressed by "Waiting, Watching, Wishing" either. The song did not have the same emotional resonance on me like the other songs did. My favorite songs on the album has to be "Don't Look Back" (co-written with MB20's Rob Thomas), "She's Not Innocent", and "Open Hearts and Doors". I also love the beautiful ballad "Michael" which is about the death of a friend of one of the band members. No matter how many times I have listened to the song, hearing Cassidy sings this song brings tears to my eyes. Overall I immensely enjoyed what I heard on this live album. In the state of music today with overproduced female pop stars, the industry needs more women like the gals in Antigone Rising. This is music with soul.

Often mistaken for an overly patriotic statement this album found Bruce suddenly among the ranks of eighties superstars as Prince, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Born in the USA is the reason why some place the Boss in the same category as Jon Bon Jovi, Born in the USA sounds as a stadium blow-out. Yet lyrics as "Born down in a dead man's town, The first kick I took was when I hit the ground, You end up like a dog that's been beat too much, Till you spend half your life just covering up" could hardly be called patriotic or shallow.

It's true that there are a million zillion bands that were more popular and made more record sales blah blah blah, but what I'm talking about here is musical genius.  Those other bands might have sold more or been more popular, but in no way could they ever play like Cream, but there is no doubt that Cream could have played anything that any other band played. (That includes The Allman Brothers, Led Zepplin, The James Gang, Deep Purple, Jetho Tull, Grand Funk Railroad, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Ten Years After, Santana, and all the others who could actually play their instruments.
This DVD is the latest release from the husband/wife team of Ravi Singh and Ana Brett. As with their previous videos, Green Energy of the Heart features Ana practicing alone, this time against a plain white backdrop with only a mat adorned by butterflies for decoration, while Ana and Ravi take turns providing voiceover instruction.
"Holiday in Berlin and its overture" is one of Zappa's signature instrumental songs. It's name perfectly suits the music that belongs to it and you will notice this when you listen to the short overture. It has a feeling of ethnic pride to it and you can just imagine hitler and his nazis proudly marching to it at one of their nurenburg rallies. Zappa probably imagined it that way too and titled it holiday in BERLIN.
While the second disc runs under 30 minutes it is worth it for fans of the album to have these classic tracks available on CD. "Take the Money and Run" demoed for "City to City" ended up on the follow up album "Night Owl" but we get an early studio version that's quite interesting. The instrumental intro and outros are under a minute and features Gerry noodling on his guitar. The demos including that of "Baker Street" are a fascinating listen as it shows that while it is very spare that Gerry had worked out the essential arrangement and that the sax solo that plays the riff originally was played on guitar.

As for the DVD, it could use some  work.  I noticed, in comparison with the VHS version, the mixers have  brought the volume down a bit on Stevie's guitar, while making the low end  sounds more prominent.  This takes away from the power of Stevie's  performance a bit.  They also still have not included the version of Little  Wing that was performed right before Third Stone From the Sun!  Please!  Include it, I will buy the DVD again!  On a bright note for the DVD, the  interview included is quite interesting, with Tommy and Chris' thoughts and  relflections on Stevie and the night of the El Mocambo show.

In my southern upbringing it seemed this band never toured the south so I simply didn't get the opportunity to see them live.  This DVD corrects that nicely.  Its really for the fans however as it isn't up to the latest standards.  Its more historic.  The quality is what one would expect of a festival from its era.  That said its remarkably good.

But some videos do give you 80's nostalgia - the 80's with a youthful band- which is now aged and somewhat tired. The packaging's art fits well, since it looks like the cover of "Black Celebration".The menus are easy to browse and select. The songs are perfect for a DVD project of this magnitude. All are hits and stories by themselves - it is the soundtrack (videos) of our lives. I'm most fond of the songs included here from "Violator". It is one of the best electronic albums of all times. By taking something from each production, the  DVD flows and provides a glimpse of the band's evolution. Should not be taken for granted.......get it!

So, you're interested in Mannheim Steamroller, but wondering where to start? Alternatively, maybe your introduction to Chip Davis and the Steamroller has been through the terrific set of Christmas music but now you're wondering what you might want to get that would explore beyond that. Either way, the Fresh Aire series is the place to go next because that's where it all began and because that's still the music that's most characteristic of the group. Within that series, the first four are the seasons cycle and all are worth getting but III is that top of my personal list of favorites. Its typical of both the Fresh Aire series and Mannheim Steamroller with the eclectic mix of instruments and both exciting and relaxing styles. Chip successfully mixes classical and rock styles, electonics and acoustic instruments (not to mention the toy piano and the cricket!).
I can't believe that there isn't a CD of this concert, but I looked all over Amazon and couldn't find any.

His haunting vocals and fine musicianship and well arranged tunes are a joy to listen to. Some lp's are a little more creative than others assuredly but his music is for the heart and his lyrics from the heart. If anyone is unfamiliar with his Steelers Wheel albums , which are a little more pop oriented owes it to themselves to give them a listen as well.

When I say GOOD sounding albums, I mean GOOD. I listen primarily to the vinyl versions of these albums to hear whats really going on in them that CD's can't capture. And no matter what you think of Harrison's EXTRA TEXTURE, DARK HORSE or LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, EMI put out very inferior CD versions of these albums to the public. On vinyl these albums are gorgeously recorded, and put many a Lennon and McCartney solo album to shame, particularly BAND ON THE RUN/VENUS & MARS/LONDON TOWN/RED ROSE SPEEDWAY/TUG OF WAR and MIND GAMES/IMAGINE/WALLS AND BRIDGES. The people that McCartney & Lennon chose to work with were either not allowed to do what they were good at, OR just were nowhere as good as Phil McDonald and his working relationship with Harrison. Alan Parsons worked with McCartney, but he also worked on Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' and his own Alan Parsons Project. And with a really good set of headphones, and a decent turntable, you'd wonder if Alan Parsons had a twin brother or doppelganger that worked for McCartney, because his work on his own and Pink Floyd outshines his work with Paul. I've never thought much of Geoff Emerick, even on albums not done with McCartney. I've heard other albums he's engineered, and even with the Wall of Sound by Phil Spector, Phil McDonald still recorded ALL THINGS MUST PASS to a standard that is barely matched on a McCartney or Lennon album. Even RINGO had good engineers working with him, particularly Bill Schnee.
Here is a lesser known song. But a great one nonetheless. A sing-a-long anthem for rock and roll. Piano based song, great swaying tempo. Awesome reverb on the guitar parts. All round a wonderful, upbeat rock song.

They say if you can remember the 60s, you weren't really there. Well whether you were or weren't, this CD captures the feel of 60s underground radio. It makes me wish even more I'd been able to hear much more of "KSAN, San Francisco/Oakland" in its "golden era" than I actually did. Highly recommended to any radio fan who wants to hear what the "San Francisco FM underground radio sound" was really like. I'm planning on getting "Volume 2" with B Mitchel Reed and look forward to hearing that one.

  It's truly an art masterpiece. It defies the listener, but the result it's so rewarding you'd be missing a lot by not giving it another chance. It might not be for you; tastes vary. But don't just diss it because of a superficial listen because there's a world you would be missing.

I may be wrong on this point, but the video quality seems a tad worse than "The Definitive Collection."  "The Winner Takes it All," for instance, is washed out in some segments and the contrast is too bright in others.  Other clips seem sharper than they appear in TDC, so I've no idea if any remastering of the original prints was involved.  The sound quality seems to be identical to "The Definitive Collection."
On this CD standout cuts include "New Fool", "Who Can Blame You", "Heartstrings" along with the Gospel "Jesus, Help me to Stand" and the title cut.
9708	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I wish i could personally thank fz and his mothers for this album. Unfortunately Frank is no longer with us but he is so alive because of his work. This is one of his finest hours it is a combo of studio and live work. Sandwiched between 2 doo wop tracks is some of the quirkiest and gorgeous music i've ever heard. WPLJ is a short little doowop tune about 'white port and lemon juice', written by the four juices, then igor's boogie which is homage to stravinsky. Overture to holiday in Berlin is a righteous song. It has peculiar sounding instrumentation and is a top tune too. it segues into 'theme from burnt weeny sandwich', one of frank's best solos from this period. You have loads of percussion stuff, and frank's wah-wah guitar gradually increasing in volume at the beginning. he plays a beautiful melodic solo and the percussion continues after the solo is over, and we move on to the 2nd igor boogie then the expanded version of holiday in Berlin-which is the 200 motels opening credits theme tune! This is a brilliant track which contains another wah-wah guitar treat-a live solo this time and a damn great segue into the lovely piano/harpsichord tune aybe sea (abc). another great segue leads into the atonal piano intro to 'the little house i used to live in'. This monster of a tune lasts 18 minutes and its all great. It shows how great a band they were. We have a rousing intro with rousing drums, more zappa guitar, a great bluesy violon solo by sugercane harris which is combined with some lovely don preston jazzy piano and some cool time signature changes; then a brief but lovely instrumental bit which is followed by a chaotic sounding zappa organ solo. and for good measure Frank ridicules a Heckler at the end. The sweet 'valarie' ends this masterpiece. Thank you.

This was the first world tour Elton had done since the 70's.  Filmed in 1992, we see a post-rehab Elton with a much more serious view of life and a return to the organics of his music making.  This was his last "Rock and Roll" world tour.  In 1994 his aspirations turned from rock to show tunes, beginning with the "Lion King".  Today, his music is changing from the raw piano driven melodies to more character-driven musical numbers.  In essence, his style and musings are coming from an entirely different area than we have seen/heard over the last 30+ years.

2205	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	NEG	2.0	Disclaimer: my copy is region B and not purchased through Amazon, but rather through an Australian retail outlet.  That said, I am staggered at the asking price for this sub-par Blu-ray on this website and I must agree with the other two reviewers. The 5.1 mix is very disappointing, I think I got more out of it by using the ProLogic ll setting on my Pioneer receiver. I can't even access the "restored mono mix", the disk case actually says that it is NOT included, despite the included 2012 trailer stating that it IS on the disk. What a selling point - here's what your disk DOESN'T have on it!! On the doco Steve Howe says that the mix on the film was done brilliantly but this sounds like it was played back in an aircraft hangar and re-recorded by a bootlegger.  As for the video, the trailer shows the film to be in 16:9 but clearly that's not how it plays back. I suspect it is just cropped anyway so we probably aren't missing anything, but to the manufacturers, don't mislead people, please. I can't comment on accessible video resolution as I don't have a HD television. The film restoration wasn't too bad, I know that there wasn't much lighting to work with and this is probably as good as it gets.

There was something about Sandy. Her style, her presence, the way she could deliver a song when she was at her best that is still unmatched. I believe one writer penned something about needing to hold onto the furniture when she was at her best. Sandy Denny was the real thing, the genuine article, and the material on this album is the best match of songs to her style that she ever got (at least on vinyl) after Liege n Lief.


What this collection is most valuable for, however, is the live performances.  Before buying this, I was under the impression that the performances were all lip-synced (the album version plays as it shows the band performing "live").  That turned out to not be the case, save for two performances at the beginning.  You get to hear Badfinger's biggest hits played live in footage taken from TV shows: "Come & Get It," "No Matter What," and "Baby Blue," as well as a rocked-up version of "Suitcase" where Pete Ham's lead & slide guitar sound awesome.  The performances are all complete and without any annoying voice-over interruptions.
862	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I waited far too long to pick this album up.  Scott Weiland truly shows his experiences and emotions during the past years through his lyrics, and I can't talk enough about the rest of the band.  Matt Sorum puts out some original and insane beats that he wasn't able to display in the early 90's, and Slash is his usual genius-self.  Not to mention how Duff subtly carries almost every track with his underlying bass.  Intros resembling Rage Against The Machine combined with guitar riffs that bring you back to the days of acid rock definitely creates an amazing debut album for this band.  GO BUY IT NOW.

Just light dulcimer elevator type music on this CD. Only song worth listening to is Christmas in the Trenches. The rest is just not very much of anything other than light tapping on a dulcimer. If you like that type of stuff, then go for it. I like to hear songs with actual lyrics.

That stuff is irrelevant to how the album sounds.  Overall, the album is a good compilation of 80s dance/pop music.  Solid ear candy for children of the 80s.  Even if Sam's voice isn't the greatest [but I'm not the best judge - not a vocalist myself], it doesn't matter that much because the catchy melodies and grooves are what matter to this type of music.  This album is bouncy; makes for good background music while you're doing stuff around the house.  Worth it.
I have read some reviews that said that they 'didn't understand the senseless jamming' or some similar statement.  the deal is simple, this is music more oriented towards the european style, or more music oriented audience.  Frank Zappa had a tendency to grow music UP, or as he put it, 'I am going to play music right now that will be better for you in the LONG RUN' instead of playing 'POP RUBBISH'  (See the ARK release)  Just because his fan base got smaller does not mean that his music was any less viable, or even less important.  Uncle Meat, as far as I am concerned is one of Frank Zappa's most reliable and important works, WAY MORE IMPORTANT than his first three releases easy.
8668	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Bowie could finally take a breathe.  Ziggy Stardust had faded away, and Bowie could do what he wished.  Well, almost.  Tony DeFries, Bowie's manager, was pressuring Bowie to come out with an album just about every  year.  Growing up in South London, Bowie had much exposure to George  Orwell's more popular novels of 'Animal Farm' and '1984.'  Most likely  starting early in his childhood Bowie became fascinated with a world that  had no freedom, justice, and equality.  He especially became fascinated  with the monstrous figure Big Brother.  A man with so much power and  dignity.  I'm sure Bowie wanted to figure out how one single man could  brainwash so many people in believing in him.  This same fascination Bowie  had in Hitler.  Bowie certainly had NO love or pride in Hitler.  After his  rock success, Bowie wanted to prove to everyone that he wasn't some dumb  rock star.  He was indeed intellectual and smart.  The best idea that stuck  out in Bowie's head was a rock-opera for Orwell's 1984.  Starting quickly  after recording Pin Ups, Bowie rented a villa in Italy and began writing  songs centering on the infamous novel.  One obstacle laid in the way,  getting permission from Orwell's widow.  She refused Bowie to write a  rock-opera and left Bowie with a lot of songs.  He configured this idea of  a hopeless world into Hunger City.  A city that had been under a nuclear  attack, and left mutated "peoploids" to roam the city in search  of food.  A very eerie and horrifying world to live in.  The album starts  out with Bowie going into great detail describing this world of Hunger  City.  Then comes "Diamond Dogs."  This song is collectively a  song with Bowie's hidden inspirations mixed in.  In 1974, the year of this  album's release, a ground breaking science-fiction novel by Samuel R.  Deleany named "Dhalgren?".  I read somewhere the lyrics of  "Diamond Dogs" and scenes from the first chapter of  "Dhalgren?" are extremely similar.  One of the most overly used  lyrics from "Sweet Thing" would have to be the infamous  "Portrait in flesh" line.  Other than that, this song is a lovely  slow and relaxing song.  "Candidate" has the richest lyrics and  poetic devices than any other Bowie song.  Another amazing note about this  song is on the RykoDisc version of "Diamond Dogs" a demo version  of "Candidate" is included.  This demo version has striking  different lyrics.  Practically opposite moods and point of views.  One of  the most widely known songs from Diamond Dogs, and later covered by Iggy  Pop and Lenny Kravtiz is "Rebel Rebel."  With all the rich and  deep meanings in all of the following songs, it's a surprise to come across  such a simple rock song with simple lyrics as "Rebel Rebel."  The  only song not credited to being written by only Bowie is "Rock 'N'  Roll With Me."  This sing, which is credited to being written by Bowie  and Warren Peace (who sang backing vocals on the Diamond Dogs Tour) is yet  again a fairly simple song.  If it had a twin, it would be "Rebel  Rebel."  Anyone that has read 1984 can see that "We Are The  Dead" is related to the novel because of the quote from the book.  This is a great song, and would have been even better performed in a  rock-opera.  A lot of Bowie fans consider "1984" to be the best  song on the LP.  There's no question it spells out the plot of the book,  along with catchy riffs and repetitive lyrics, no wonder it's many fans  favorite.  "Big Brother" shows Bowie's fascination for the big  figure of Big Brother.  An awkward tune yet curious to the listeners' ears,  "Chant of The Ever Circling Skeletal family" is a one line song.

This CD is great from start to finish, and as soon as you listen to it all the way through once, you realize why it's an American classic. There is not a bad song on here--surprisingly, the weakest songs are the singles "Dancing in the Dark" and "Glory Days." Songs that were never released as singles are the ones that sound the most original, the least commercial, and are the ones that rock the hardest. What amazes me about this CD is its ability to make me feel like I'm actually in Jersey in the mid-eighties--a fantastic trick, since during the mid-eighties I was about five years old and living in Ohio.

7385	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Theoretically R.Kelly's debut album,as a solo artist anyway is very crucial for the development of music in the 90's. It was transitional music easing out of the hip-hop based new jack swing style of the beginning of the decade towards what would eventually be known as "neo soul",a largely retro funk based sound usually informed by hip-hop rather than being dependant on it. Creatively R.Kelly embodies many of the qualities of the R&B/soul/funk greats that came before him. He's a songwriter/vocalist with a strong flair for song construction and strong,gospel informed singing and (most importantly perhaps) a multi instrumentalist with the ability to create sturdy grooves and,for example the good sense to bring in jazz guitarist Bobby Broom to play on "Your Body's Callin'". Lyrically this album blends the sacred and the secular in the classic soul tradition. It was a quality he'd maintain throughout his career. "Bump N Grind" was of course the big hit and the album followed that excellent groove,for the most part in the same manner."For You","It Seems Like Your Ready" and the extended jam "Sex Me" all follow that same basic mid-tempo neo-funk groove to a tee. This album also includes a touching story song type tribute to his mother in "Sadie",full of gospel organ and all kinds of soulful breaks and release. The same goes musically for the closing title song,the main difference is that one as with the rest of the album is based in heavy duty bedroom music,visually explicit without the use of explicit language. The interesting part is,as pointed out in many reviews the album is actually one of the few of it's type I've heard where the album loses some energy when the tempo picks up. With the exception of the strong "Summer Bunnies" the majority of the uptempo cuts such as "Homie Lover Friend","Freak Dat Body","Back To The Hood Of Things" and "I Like The Crotch On You" feature raps by DeAndre Boykins and Carey Kelly that are very repetitive and very uninteresting. Since this album was at it's time looking to innovate to a degree the inclusion of rapping on these songs kind of seemed like a step back and,in the future Kelly would come to do much much better at utilizing hip-hop in his music. For the longest time I thought of R.Kelly as a bit of a one trick pony who was likely not very capable of delivering anything close to a consistant album. After all that tended to be a problem for a lot of music of this particular era. For those I will have to say this album will certainly prove those naysayers wrong,including myself.
This is an energized concert with the band at their best, putting a lot into the show for a large crowd and the many photographers and cameras.

  The first set has it's good and not so good qualities. Songs like "Cumberland Blues" and "Me and My Uncle" were played almost as well as they were played 20 years ago. During "Desolation Row," Bob Weir sang solo (until the end)- with a catchy rhythm on his guitar. Though many other musicians tend to lose their voice over the years, Weir proves that this is not always the case.

GUYS AND DOLLS is a fun musical with Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra centering around a bet. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, GUYS AND DOLLS is a memorable 1955 film and one of the last great musicals of the era. It made by Samuel Goldwyn Productions and distributed by MGM. Sinatra plays Nathan Detroit a gambler who proposes a $1000 bet where Sky (Marlon Brando) must take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Nathan chooses Sergeant Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), a straight laced sister at a soul saving Mission, modeled after the Salvation Army that strenuously opposes gambling. For me, I loved Frank Sinatra's performance as Nathan Detroit and it was indeed a memorable screen performance and character that he created.

Granted That's When I Reach for My Revolver is the standout track, the nature of the format dictates that featured  tracks often eclipse the others on a great many Eps & singles. Perhaps  self-consciously avante-garde tracks like This Is Not a Photograph or Max  Ernst seem out of place. Max Ernst was a holdover from the pre-Burma band  The Moving Parts and Photograph had been refined to such a degree that this  version would effectively supplant the earlier version in the minds of all  but the completist. How about  All World Cowboy Romance, an irresistably  silly title behind which a layered and cunning beauty resides. All of that  said, if you haven't already purchased VS. (not to be confused with the  Pearl Jam album of the same name)  then do so without delay. VS. is where  anyone interested in Burma should start. Nothing can prepare you. No amount  of listening to early glories such as Academy Fight Song (not on Signals,  Calls and Marches Ep originally anyway) will come close, so few records  have. This endlessly inventive, humorous, passionate and influential  collection will stand on its own merits with or without critical acclaim.  Like a "..mineral deposit, a ball of mica, inside a rock."!

So we have to make do with what we have. That said, this is a pretty good concert movie (my only compaints being the artsy-fartsy looking black & white picture in most of the film and the exclusion of the song "Hawkmoon 269" which was on the RATTLE AND HUM album). Otherwise, there are great live performances here, like "Where The Streets Have No Name", "With Or Without You", "Bullet The Blue Sky", the excellent cover of the Beatles "Helter Skelter", and a fiery rendition of "Sunday Bloody Sunday", which was performed on the day of the Enniskillen, Ireland massacre which Bono talks to the crowd about - U2 just tear it up!!! Those performances are yet another reminder of what a great band U2 are - critical moaning about the movie being pompous and overblown are completely irrelevant. Anyway, great concert movie!!!
In short, everyone seems to be hell bent on playing their instruments as if they were billy clubs, flogging the same damn horse. This is particularly evident on the likes of "Tokyo Storm Warning" and "Honey Are You Straight Or Are You Blind?" Elsewhere, the atmosphere could only be described as perverse. "Poor Napolean" reeks of a 10 day bender & "Anywhere You Hang Your Head" is the sonic equivalent of a suicidal hangover.
How disappointing, then, when I heard the rest of the disc!  The second track, "THE LAST NIGHT," featuring wife Korey, is a nice follow up to REBIRTHING, no doubt - but then there was another slow song, then a slight break with BETTER THAN DRUGS, and then slow, and then slow, and then slooooow . . . till I got to THOSE NIGHTS - and that's when I actually picked up the cover to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten an Audio Adrenaline CD (those "Oh-Oh-Ohs" in the backing vocals . . . COME ON, MAN!)  Sadly, the rock edge is just missing this time.  Skillet started with grunge, then segued into industrial a bit before landing firmly in hard rock with ALIEN YOUTH and COLLIDE, their best works to date.  This is a sad turn into more mellow territory.  It is still loud, but it just lacks the emotional punch and verve of the previous releases.  I don't mind some slower songs, in fact I've always liked them before.  But when its track after track, it just gets disappointing!  Like the reviewer below said, this album seems geared for a different audience, a more mainstream audience that likes catchy ballads - it is not the disk that long-time fans of this stellar band deserve!  I hope they will return to edgier sounds in their subsequent releases.

The soundscapes take a little bit of time to grow on you, but when they do, they sound just as great as the rest of the tracks. I highly recommend this CD, along with "Heroes." It's set up sort of the same way as "Low," except it doesn't have that pop edge to it and has more of a rock sound. Oh, if you find the out-of-print Rykodisc for a decent price, I recommend getting that version of "Low" instead. It has three really good bonus tracks.

I thought that almost all of the songs on this CD were enjoyable to listen to, though only two became relatively well known. The songs on "Madman Across the Water" illustrate the excellent voice of Elton John and the writing skills of Bernie Taupin. My ratings:
Over time Elton played keyboards of various types, but on his recent album "Songs from the West Coast" he returned to the piano once again, recalling the relative innocence of this early music, though with the maturity of a talented, seasoned artist. I think it is a tribute to the power of this early music that Elton has returned to it once again in an album released decades after this album.
Highly recommended.

Although it's a great album, this album flaws. Outside of Murray's lyrics, he never seperates from the Def Squad pack, lacking variety in his rhymes (especially compared to Redman). I've heard him on later albums, and he sounds so much better than he did on here. Also, the track "Escapism" is the only forgettable song on the album, mainly because I don't like the sample being used (Pete Rock used the same sample on the introduction of "Lots Of Lovin").

As 'Tiny Dancer' prances it's way out of your speakers you can really tell you are about to here some pure British pop bliss. Needless to say 'Tiny Dancer' went on to become one of his biggest hits due to it's lush instrumentation and picturesque lyrics, with just a slight country twang. It is among El tons all time best. 'Levon' follows next, and aside from, 'Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters' off Honky Chateau it might just be his very best track. The story telling lyrics and great piano work make for one memorable track. 'Razor Face' aside from being sandwiched between two classics is quite the amazing tune itself. In El tons canon it stands alone as it sounds nothing like the rest of his work and must be heard to truly understand and appreciate. The title track, and focal point of the album 'Madman Across The Water' runs next and boy is it epic. Shock-pop at it's finest. At a staggering length the song never bores and is always haunting. 'Indian Sunset' is quite the adventure. Really the only song that could follow the title track. It is up, it's down, slow then fast. The sudden tempo changes mixed with the creative instrumentation paint a picture in your head to follow the lyrics making this one of Elton and Bernie's most memorable ventures together.
Afterthis magical trip down to Memory Lane, we fade away from the theatrics to the obligatory Saloon Song medley, a trademark section of all of Frank's tv specials. Featuring Frank alone, wandering alone in a darkened saloon, reminiscing about lost love. The medley starts off and is essentially buolt around "Last Night When We Were Young". "Violets For Your Furs" is sweet, but the highlight is the brief, bonechilling rendition of "Here's That Rainy Day". Frank really lunders the emotional depths of this song, and he scores every time.

The first six tracks are mini songs that on first listen seem emotionally irrelevant, especially when compared to the rest of the album. But they are just as beautiful after repeated listens. They become their own little moments of life but just clouded in a pop format. On these songs Bowie doesn't seem to care about the lyrics, although on Always crashing in the same car there is some interesting imagery. These songs are really quite straight forward and what makes them just as emotional as the stuff on the other side I can't explain with words. It's definitely  grace to some of the treatments from Brian Eno.

This recording is perfect proof that Frank Zappa was way more than a rock'n'roll guitar player, which unfortunately is the only way many saw him, and still do. He was and is an underrated composer as well and this is some of best work. This recording MIGHT not appeal to you if "Bobby Brown Goes Down" and "Valley Girl" are your favorite Zappa songs, but is deeply recommended to fans of "Civilization Phaze III," where Ensemble Modern is partly featured by the way. "C.P.III" is a must for those who like this recording and vice versa. It is a shame that Zappa didn't have enough time to record more music like this. Recently released, though, is a CD called "Everything Is Healing Nicely," consisting of recordings from the "Yellow Shark" rehearsals. Also worth checking out.

While Sweet has released some excellent albums in the past decade (and last year's 18-track Time Capsule anthology is a great place to start for the uninitiated), Girlfriend is Sweet's perfect album.  It's full of great melodies and pop hooks, and in Richard Lloyd (co-founder of the band Television) and Robert Quine (Richard Hell & the Voidoids, Lou Reed) the album boasts two terrific lead guitarists.  Standout tracks like "Girlfriend" and especially "Divine Intervention" are reminiscent of Revolver-era Beatles, only with grittier guitar. But there's more to Sweet than loud guitars. For example, listen to the lovely ballad "Winona" or the achingly beautiful "You Don't Love Me" which both employ the plaintive pedal steel guitar work of Greg Leisz (who has worked extensively with Dave Alvin).  And on "Thought I Knew You," Sweet plays lead guitar and sounds a lot like R.E.M.

Now we're talking 1977 here. Bandstand was mimed, Top of the Pops was mimed; many, many of these shows were done this way to make recording the show easier. In Marc's case, they recorded new versions of Bolan's hits in the studio -- "Ride a White Swan," "Get it On," "Telegram Sam," -- as well as some newer material, "Endless Sleep," "Sing me a Song," and material from "Dandy in the Underworld."

At best, she's a mind-blowing performer that takes control of  the stage and makes you love her.  Some of the highlights of this set of  hits are include funky scenes in such upbeat songs as "What Have You  Done For Me Lately" and "When I Think Of You".  Stage  presence is proven on faire like "Control" and the rocking  "Black Cat" (even a panther can't take your eyes off Janet).  Her  choreographed to perfection solo apartment romp in "Pleasure  Principle" combines her excellent moves and sex appeal.  Janet gets  downright epic on dance masterpieces like "Rhythm Nation" and  "Miss You Much".  These videos really made the big dance number  essential to all pop songs.  The videos are only shot in black and white,  but the are revolutionary even in cinematography.  Continuing on the epic  front are a trip back in time in "Alright" (warning, not the  Heavy D long version).  Innocence be damned when Janet lets her waist line  show in the sexy yet charming "Love Will Never Do Without You"  and the steamy scenario of "That's The Way Love Goes".  A trip  across the world is seen in "Runaway".  The cute "Whoops  Now" is a big bonus of home video.  And I should also mention the song  is on the end of the "Janet" record.  Sorry if I forget to  mention that in the review of the album.

10)  You Got No Right - Good song, starts slow and picks up.  Has a serious tone to it.  Good guitars, as usual.  Weiland sounds sincere.  Thoughtful lyrics, and the music matches up well.  Ballad-y, but its still pretty solid.  7/10
"Superhuman" grew on me; at first I didn't care for it, but now its actually a pretty good song.  "Set Me Free" is probably my favorite song on the album.  It is incredibly catchy, and very good to listen to in all conditions.  "You Got No Right" immediately following "Set Me Free," however, slows down the whole album, something that could have easily been avoided.  So now that the album slows down, it goes into a pretty fast song, "Slither."  "Slither" is their first single, and what introduced me to them, but "Fall to Pieces" is why I bought the album; that and "Dirty Little Thing," another really good song.  "Dirty Little Thing" is one of those songs where you know you've heard it before, but you don't know who it is or where you heard it from, you just know its good, but yes, it is a great song.

Sonically, this is stunning!!!  For those with a really high resolution hi-fidelity system to play this through, this film will sound demo-quality.  The dynamics are breathtaking.  Unlike many more modern concert videos which have soundtracks which are compressed to death (All instruments sound pretty equally of the same loudness resulting in not being able to hear in and around the instruments.), this soundtrack is alive, full and realistic.  Deep bass is low, extended, tight and quite revealing of texture.  You'll need a more accurate system to pick up the bass on this.  Highs are absolutely naturally rendered.  Cymbals, for example, have a rich shimmer to them, and reveal the harmonic textures as opposed to being harsh, grainy, thin and tinny which I'm more used to in more modern DVDs.  Drums can be felt in the gut, again, if you have a system that is up to it.  By the way, another example of a well-recorded and engineered DVD concert film is the Leonard Cohen Live in London DVD.

Grew up with this music, and somehow each new release would be just what I was feeling at the time.  I had a 2-octave voice for a while, music teacher loved it, but I could only get close to his.  He was very influential in music at the time, and for a long while after.  My dates often liked to hear his music while we, er, cuddled.  I still listen to him often.  I actually saw this on my PBS station shortly before buying this, but still have the original 45s (NBQ) I bought.  Just plain good listening music.  I don't generally like live performance CDs (like them live when I'm in the audience), but this one was a little more "personal" with the brief comments from on stage, and the other top performers giving tribute.
It's a good inversion....
Just as the interludes create a sense of expectancy, the songs themselves also possess that quality. "Forty-Six & Two" is a gripping progression of texture, essentially relying on one big riff but gradually upping the intensity by stacking the arrangement with denser sonics as it goes. "Third Eye," lasting more than 13 minutes and spanning enough musical ideas to fill an entire record, similarly summons a sense of tension with surprising tempo changes and long washes of instrumentation. Lengthy, explorative instrumental passages speckle the album thickly, but Tool's impossibly tight instrumental interplay, sense of detail, and precision keeps it from being boring, although it may take a serious listener to really pay attention to depth of each segment.

Due to delays in getting this substandard album released, Blondie has stated they are already well underway with their next album.

You play as if you are one with the saxophone, Mr. Klemmer. Melodies that flow from `Free Fall Lover' all the way to `Walk With Me My Love And Dream , alas, the words cannot describe. This is truly wondrous jazz at it's finest. We often press play and then `repeat all' so we can hear it in the middle of the night. How is it that after many moons the sound is still so fresh? Mr. Klemmer, do tell!  I'll continue to spread the word about this gem. The best I can do is continue to share my views in hopes that another may share my same experience. You are truly one of the great sax players in jazz history.
'Breaking Glass' 'What In The World' 'Sound And Vision' 'Always Crashing In The Same Car' and 'Be My Wife are all great rockers. The lyrics on this album are hard to get at first and sometimes takes quite a few listens before you truly understand what the song is about and what is actaully happening during the track. 'Subterraneans' is taking from David Bowies love for Jack Kerouack's literature and the book of the same title. The song is a great closer to say the least. The album also has a great opener as well. 'Speed Of Life' is a perfect segway into the album from Station To Station and into 'Breaking Glass. The song is an instrumental or really a grand soundscape as is much of the rest of the album. 'A New Career In A New Town' 'Art Decade' and 'Weeping Wall' are all instrumentals and I know when I first thought of Bowie doing instrumentals especially with Synths I was skeptical but it works out and really paid off for him. 'Warsawa' is a 6:20 length song sang in either French or German and it sounds strange but if it wasn't than it would not be Bowie would it? A great track and one that makes for an interesting listen every time.

5323	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The first of the three Indiana Jones scores, Raiders established the popular Raiders March Theme as an instant classic in the world.  As easily recognizable as the Star Wars fanfare, John Williams' Raiders March is the first track on this expanded edition of the Raiders soundtrack, from there it becomes a great thrillride that follows Indy's adventures to find the Ark.  Along with the standard music there are some bonus tracks that were not previously published before.  The insert has an interview with John Williams, pictures from the making of the movie and a break down of the tracks.  This is a superior soundtrack recording and unlike the more mature sound to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, has many more instances where the Raiders March is used.  Other themes to listen for include the ark theme, which makes a brief reappearance in Last Crusade, is used many times here as well as the love theme for Indy and Marion.  This is an excellent cd and I highly recommend it.
In 2005 the perceptive music journalist Jon Harris attempted to explain why lesser talents have been posthumously feted, but Sandy Denny remains a decidedly cult interest. He went on to interview "the Guv'nor" Ashley Hutchings one of English folk music's most pivotal figures who argued that Denny "needs to be re-evaluated. She wrote a kind of song that's very rarely written now - emotional, musically interesting, sung really well - serious songwriting. She was head and shoulders above the rest. And she remains so". These are very fine words and with the passage of time you sense that the process of revaluation is gathering pace. As "North Star Grassman and the Ravens' proves Denny is a songwriter as musically important as Judee Sill, Laura Nyro, Janis Ian and Joni Mitchell, thus no record collection is complete without her.
5620	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	There are few surprises here: This 20 track, 2 volume in one CD is a first rate compilation of Roy's golden years with Monument records in the early to mid 1960s. Naming favorite tracks is highly subjective, for each of us has our pet choices.  Roy had so many hits and most were done his unique triple octave voice that led up to climactic fadeouts or endings. (This reviewer does not actually know what a "triple octave" voice is but I have heard it used often in referring to Roy). The best goldies from this viewpoint are "It's Over" and the ultimate climax song "In Dreams".  Who else could hit that high note? Who else would dare attempt it? This reviewer also liked "Blue Bayou" and "I'm Hurtin". And yes, "Pretty Woman" is here too. Some amazon friends have complained that none of Roy's selections from his later years are included but those are beyond the scope of this CD. It is vital to note that amazon has an extensive (!) selection of Roy CDs. I don't know of any that match the value of this particular one.  Why keep scrolling down? Why wait?

I'm not a great fan of facial muggings or contorsions gone amuck for that matter [I won't go into names but I believe the reviewer Mr. Burke is with me on that one with regard to a name or indeed names therein] nor any histrionic gyrations at the piano or, quite frankly, key banging being passed off under the guise of some sort of 'tour de force' kind of thing. You know, comes the stringed instrument and 'it ain't playing unless there are broken strings!'

6607	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I took a risk getting this album as I had never heard of Joe Sample before but I knew that I would be getting good sound quality from a GRP recording and boy was I pleasantly surprised!  This album comes from a digital master and hasn't been remastered but sounds a lot better than many of the so-called remastered cds that are out there.  Also, I've discovered just how good Joe's playing is and this is one of my favourite smooth jazz albums in my collection.  Highly recommended and I'm glad I stumbled across this gem!
I narrowed it down to the following choices (you can check out ratings on Amazon and clips on YouTube):
What I find most perplexing about the exclusion of videos is that this product is  entirely independent of a musical release, while THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION  video was not. Because THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION album did not feature gems  like "Everybody," "Burning Up," "Dress You  Up," "Gambler," "True Blue," "Who's That  Girl," and "Causing a Commotion," it could be argued that  they had no place on her video collection of the same name. Meanwhile, the  video for "Oh Father," another non-IMMACULATE track, WAS  included. Go figure. However, videos for IMMACULATE tracks "Crazy For  You," "Into the Groove," and "Live To Tell," were  NOT included. While these videos were contributions to the films VISION  QUEST, DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN and AT CLOSE RANGE, respectively, each  song stands on its own merits, as does its video. "Into the  Groove" is the quintessential '80s song, "Live To Tell" is  unforgettable, and "Crazy For You" has held up remarkably well  over the years.

As video after video passes by you tend to think, how can they outdo each other but then by the time Enjoy The Silence comes on it tends to get the goosebumps going and the emotions at searing point. The scenery that is on display is quite breathtaking and shows a king who is walking throughout the world to get away from the madness and to have some peace and serenity. Truly magnificent
With that in mind, and that Supernatural is one of  the coolest albums I've heard in a long time, I conclude that this is one  of the smartest albums ever recorded.
 "Didja Get Any Onya?" sounds strangely Teutonic and very atonal. Transport some Vikings to the Planet of the Apes, and you'll get the idea. Zappa's "Charles Ives" composition makes an appearance. "Directly From My Heart..." is a classic tune with fiddle-as-mouth harp. Truly unique. "Prelude.." has a few of the same elements as "Didja Get Any Onya?", except that it's even more bizarre listening. Quite chaotic, it segues into its polar opposite: the tuneful, yet eccentric "Toads Of The Short Forest". The midsection zips back into atonality, as Frank shares with us the time signatures being used by the various Mothers. This is one of my favorite Zappa recordings.
This is great album.

Apart from White Room, and Crossroads, Wheels of Fire is an eclectic, sophisticated (by rock standards) collection of songs that for some (including Eric Clapton) is an acquired taste.  That it topped the charts was perhaps more the result of their huge fan base and legendary reputation than the records commercial appeal.  Also driving sales was the reputation of their previous album, Disraeli Gears, a pop psychedelic classic featuring a host of radio-friendly songs.  Wheels of Fire was a decidedly different song collection than Disraeli Gears,less pop but more interesting;  a reflection of the groups divergent musical tastes that, by the summer of 1968, was driving them apart.  I treasure all of Creams albums, and Wheels of Fire most of all.

Trust me, this British guitar duo is like listening to Peter White times two.  Wonderful instrumentals abound on this disc with influences that vary from oriental with the catchy and "hum-alongable" "Mr. Chow" to subtley rock and western flavored "The Stone Circle," and then to the great flamenco meets Larry Carltonisms of the title track.  Everything on here is great, uncluttered, memorable, and timeless.  My personal favorite is the bright and spirited "One for the Road."  Please buy this oldie but goodie.  I had it on vinyl with the old MCA cactus picture for years, and still wonder why it took so long to purchase it on disc.  It's worth it simply because the music is just that good.
As winter gave way to summer, "Eyes Without a Face" was part of the summer soundtrack for the rock n' rollers that included the hits from albums like 1984 (Van Halen), Pyromania (Def Leppard), Out of the Cellar (Ratt).

9446	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	There's always been something intriguing about this album.  The songs may not to be so technical as some of the other masterful rock/metal albums i enjoy(Arcturus' La Masquerade Infernale, any album by Faith No More,  Mr. Bungle, Opeth, Acid Bath, Amorphis, ect. ect.), but the songs are  delivered with such innovation and brilliance that I have always came back  for more. the lyrics are offensive but at the same time, intelligent.  The  bass is melodic and thumping.  The drums are executed well and sometimes  make you wonder how they play so well live.  The guitars, on the other  hand, are not very innovative(virtually ALL drop-D tuning and power  chords), but they fit into the music very, very well(I give Adam Jones  credit.  Apart from being a fairly decent guitar player, he is also a  puppeteer.  He did all the puppetry for their videos).  Now the highlight  of this album: the vocals.  Maynard James Keenan has a really strong, if  not, distinctive voice.  I was amazed at how long he could hold his voice  on "Eulogy".  Not many other singers can do that(apart from Mike  Patton, Garm Wolf, and Simen Hestnaes).  For music similar to this, I  recommend The Melvins' Stag, Acid Bath, and if you want to be completely  amazed, Arcturus' La Masquerade InFernale.  Thank you.
Springsteen is often cataloged as a rocker, but this album has distinctly folk-like ethos succinctly displayed throughout this CD. His ability and willingness to accord fair treatment to 'unhip' and 'uncomfortable' topics is readily apparent throughout the entire recording.
I will not compare this presentation to others that I think are better because everyone will have a favorite and there is room for them all.

The lyrics rock as much as the music.
8723	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Tool is unlike any other band on the planet or in any dimension! They are metal, yet progressive, yet not metal. Not your typical Nu-metal or post punk or post rock or whatever label you want to put on them. They have created their own rhythms, styles and melodies that defy everything that most people consider "metal" or "progressive" or "rock". Hard hitting, chanting invoking Tribal infused rhythms that unleash the inner being of animus and energy within, lyrics that speak of healing/magick and pain, bass lines that add a massive depth to the music, and guitar riffs that crunch and wail throughout ones soul. Aenima(IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU SPELL IT PEOPLE, STOP OVER OBSESSING AND OVER ANALYZING EVERYTHING!) at its very core is an amazing work of art that centralizes around the colors electric blue, black, white and green, and emphasizes the unleashing of anger and resentment toward humans, all the while converting pain into power and experience. Raw lyrics sung by one of the most beautiful voices on the planet, laid over some of the most head nodding and soul evoking sounds. Dig deep down into yourself and feel what comes out of you when you hear this music. Some kind of primal feeling of something that is had to remember, yet you know it is there. Aenima is an experience of emotion and pure energy. No other bands can do that. None come close. Tool is in their own catagory. Don't get me wrong, there are no humans on this earth that are better than any other humans, and to think so is pure idiotic and sub-servient. One of the core themes around Tool is the empowerment of the self, which a lot of Tool fans, and metal fans forget or don't know about. Some praise Tool as gods. Please people, they are just people too. Every artists is just a person who happened to speak first. WE all think these things and feel them, some of us just say them first and say them loud. I love Tool, and I think they are amazing musicians. I think that Aenima is chock full of anger, misdirected at that. Anger is good, if one knows how to utilize it and put it in its place. The mystical side of this cd is a wonderful and a great journey into the pain of humantiy and power of us all. I don't believe that this is their greatest accomplishment(LATERALUS IS THE ONE), but this is certainly one of the best albums of its decade and of our generation. But then again, what Tool album isn't?

I don't like Tool because they are "smart", "witty" or "pretentious" or whatever the people who don't like them want to label the band.  I just like them because the music is candy for my ears.
That the new Steely Dan can affect me in a way not unsimilar  to the old is a good sign.  I love how in "Two Against Nature"  the Jazz moves from the mid-range to the forefront; the horns, the style,  it is all big band, even as the agenda of the songs is so different and  dissonant.  That is the most beautiful thing about the Steely Dan songs;  how there is something dark, desperate and perverse in the lyrics while  simultaneously, the most beautiful of music is being made; as if no matter  how horrible one's reality is, there is a transcendent beauty in the  greater things, and this is represented by the music.

Highlights remain the title track, "Life In The Fast Lane" (inspired by a dealer friend that Frey had about the drug use of stars in L.A. and a riff that Joe Walsh used to use to warp up at practice with other band members), "The Last Resort" which seemed to be Eagles ultimate comment on the world of the 70's as a counterpoint to the darker elements of the title track focusing on the world and how we can affect it.

  Anyway, here are my picks as the best songs on the album, plus the rest:
With the production/songwriting help of the popular American R&B group of Full Force, Samantha scored her two biggest hits ever. Full Force, fresh from their work with Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and before they starred in the "House Party" films of the early 1990's wrote and produced the two most widely popular songs on this album: "I Wanna Have Some Fun," and "Naughty Girls (Need Love Too." Both songs, which feature fast and catchy beats, and Samantha rapping at times were number one hits in the U.K. and the U.S. and sealed Samantha's fame among the dance divas of that decade.
This collection of videos is not just for Bjork fans, but for anyone interesting in REAL works of music video art. This DVD has been used in college and University media courses all over the world, and it's not hard to see why! Bjork represents the ultimate in the complexity of the human brain. She is an uncalculated genius whose talent knows no bounds. This can be seen in this DVD; no other video artist has consistently put out unique and interesting music videos that always have a strong message about the behaviour of human beings. Buy this now, it's absolutely essential.
Set Me Free-10/10: Starts off with a crazy riff from Slash that's followed up by Duff's bass line and Sorum's drumming that sets the stage for Weiland's vocals, that sound almost like B.B.

The album ends with the classic My Hometown. The song wistfully reflects on growing up in America and living with the hopelessness of a town's economic blight and jobs forever lost. Springsteen isn't looking through rose colored glasses on this album, and the U.S.A. that he sings about is not picture postcard perfect. But while the image of the America we see here is framed with hard times and disillusionment, the portrait itself is really of the perseverance, compassion and hope of the American spirit.

Carole King hearts James Taylor. It's all over her face as she harmonizes or just mouths the words to his songs. But then, she's hugely emotional as a signature. Her songs are hits in large part because she's brilliant at distilling deep feelings into simple statements --- "You've Got a Friend" is the gold standard --- and excitable as a musician. When she gets going, she's off the piano bench and playing standing up.

It's thrilling to hear renditions of songs such as "Rollin' & Tumblin'," "Sweet Black Girl," and "High Heeled Sneakers," songs we've come to treasure as back-bending electric blues staples, sounding all the more demanding, lighter than ear, and all the more essential here.

5209	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Fun album with a great bunch of musicians, but I almost wish that Taj had not used the word "Blues" in the title, because this album offers many diverse musical styles; the usual Taj Mahal stew of jazz, folk, country, reggae, gospel, rock, and of course blues. But these are not the sort of blues to get you down and drown in your tears, but fun, uplifting songs like "Queen Bee", the title cut, "I Miss You Baby", and a frisky cover of "You Rascal You." And for the outrageously low price of $3.99 you can NOT go wrong with this purchase. One other note: The product details from Amazon are a bit misleading; even though this edition of the CD was released in 2009, the original album came out in 1997. Taj is best known for his output in the 1970s, but he's in fine form on this album also.

9. Set Me Free-5/5-The first song Velvet Revolver recorded and the first I ever heard is really good. Catchy and well arranged. Weiland makes it even more clear on this song how different he can make his voice sound.
12. "The Power of Goodbye"  Beautiful beach style video.  This song was also the theme for that limited appeal defunct TV show "Felicity".
Cold and Ugly- these two songs... cold and ugly and jerk off want to make me see tool incredibly bad, then again... this was a while ago. These two songs are being rated together, 10/10.
Weckl definitely gets his time in the spotlight, and NO ONE can do it quite like him. Some of the songs did take a few listens to get into, I admit, but this is now one of my favorite CDs of all time. If you think the samples on Amazon are interesting AT ALL, then BUY IT.

5332	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Even though many people have never included Raiders Of The Lost Ark as one of John Williams's best scores, it is in fact a great classic that is in the same league as Star Wars, Superman, and Jurassic Park.  The Raiders theme has been heard everywhere and sounds like a mockery of the campy-sounding action movies of the past, and the secondary theme for Indy sounds mysterious and truly suspensful.  What makes this score so great, though, is because it sounds like a mix between Star Wars A New Hope, and Return Of The Jedi.  It sounds heroic and bright like New Hope but dark like Return Of The Jedi.  Marion's theme sounds like and almost starts off like Princess Leia's.  The Ark and Nazi themes are my favorites.  The Ark theme sounds mysterious and vague until its powers are released on The Miracle Of The Ark, where it sounds powerful and out of this world.  The Nazi's theme sounds truly menacing and rivals even the Imperial theme of Empire Strikes Back.  I recommend this to any fan of John Williams or action-lovers.  It is a true classic in film scoring.

The album also featured two songs by Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy who would also go on to front Slash's group for his world tour during which he would sing songs from Slash's former bands as well as tracks from the album, so every night Kennedy would be filling the shoes of Axl Rose, Scott Weiland, Andrew Stockdale, Ian Astbury and Chris Cornell it was a job that he performed admiringly as his voice handled all the different ranges. So for Slash's second album Kennedy performs all the tracks, it seems like a natural progression and a working relationship has been built up by the two men.
I wasn't disappointed. People Gonna Talk is a really good R&B album. James Hunter is a Brit who probably wasn't even alive in the early 1960s but his music and vocals could pass for a top notch early 1960s R&B act.

Lateralus is an increible album but aenima has so much more meaning to it and aenima is also the album where they started to explore their sonic template. This album also has many themes to it as well that make it an incredibly well thought out album. Songs such as eulogy and pushit are songs that show tool's more aggresive side but then you have songs like stinkfist that ate about compasion and third eye, a song about drug abuse. This album really made tool shine, to say the least it is an absolutly amazing album that i would recomend to anyone
I highly recommend this CD - it will be a family favorite for years to come!
This 1987 concert captures the legendary Roy Orbison only a year before his death and singing better than ever.  Roy is one vocalist who actually got better with age. When you listen to Orbison's classic Monument recordings, you can hear him straining to reach those high notes at the end of songs like "Crying".  Roy's voice had matured and improved by the 80's which is clearly heard in this show as he hits those challenging notes with the ease of an opera singer.

5607	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is the best single disc collection of Roy Orbison's Monument hits. It was originally released on 2 LPs in the early 80's. One thing I've always wondered about is that this 20 track CD has always been also available as 2 separate volumes with 10 tracks each & having the same cover artwork (you'd have to be careful to read the list of tracks on the back) Why?? If someone is an Orbison fan why would they want one volume & not the other? Why not just have all 20 tracks on one CD, as it is done here? Also, one reviewer asks why "You Got It" isn't here,well it's because that song wasn't even recorded yet when this album was released, and that song was on Virgin Records,not Monument.
This live album is more than deserving of five stars, but I do see a couple of minor problems with it.  For one thing, it is relatively short, adding up to just over thirty four minutes; I should note that this is the most intense, action-packed thirty four minutes I've ever experienced, though.  To my great consternation, I found that tracks six and seven were listed backwards, with What the World Needs Now is Love actually preceding Once in Love With Amy; I will never understand how mistakes like that can happen on a released CD.  Finally, this CD does not contain a full and complete recording of the concert.  There are gaps in between most of the songs, so I'm not sure whether or not the songs are presented in the order Sammy performed them, nor can I keep myself from wondering what other musical magic was made that night that was not released for posterity.  Given the strength of the performance as a whole, though, these are minor quibbles that have absolutely nothing to do with Sammy, who threw himself completely into all of these songs.  No Sammy Davis Jr. collection is complete without The Sounds of '66.

Once I got more into the actual music, there were more surprises. The compositions were at times extremely complex, or quite jazzy and funky. I was also impressed with the way keyboard and guitar melodies would merge as one, with Chick even bending notes on his keys whenever Scott or Carlos used their whammy bar! Of course, this "doubling up" melodies has always been around, but I'd never heard it quite like this. It's a very effective technique.

Jingle Bell Rock - Bobby Helms
His instrumental skills are quite different from, say, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Yes and Black Sabbath.  Zappa has a unique style that's completely his own.  Sometimes his instrumental playing sounds goofy, and it's totally intentional because he knew he had something special going, but there's enough diversity in his style and playing that any kind of intentional silliness doesn't really matter.  What matters is that Frank Zappa has an original sound, and Burnt Weeny Sandwich captures him during his legendary classic period.  Besides, a moment of silliness usually morphs into a complex jazzy jam showing just how much capability the man had.

Larger than Woodstock, the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival was attended by an estimated 600,000 people.  It was a tumultuous event, with the fences breaking down and thousands of people getting in for free, fights breaking out, and general chaos.  But at 2 am in the morning, the Who took the stage and wowed the crowd. This is a high energy show, with all of the band members being in top form.  As a big fan of The Who, I really like this concert DVD, and it is only through a superhuman example of restraint that I am able to refrain from commenting on each and every song.

I also give them props for the goofy jokes Harry Manback and Dier Von Satan. Those are geniunely funny. However, those props kind of lose their well, propability when one examines the other "nonsong" tracks, and runs into record needle feedback, a baby crying, and four minutes of shaking sheet metal.

So all in all, a quintessential part to any pop/rock music fan, and a fine performance from all angles.


Zappa was a musical genius and it shows in spades on this album.  The tragedy is that essentially none of these cuts received any amount of commercial air play.  Compared to most songs that get saturation air play every 10 minutes these seven are nothing less than golden nuggets of musical brilliance.  Zappa's lyrics are at times silly, intelligent, nonsensical and witty; also his timing is always perfect.  He seems to know exactly when the appropriate moment is to interject his legendary guitar play into various sections of these tracks.
All the songs deal primarily with the ups and downs of everyday christian life (the assurance of God's provision and His glory, the absence of loved ones either through death or lost faith, spiritual struggles both physical and supernatural) and are presented with such a beautiful subtlety. The standout songs here are "Secret Ambition" and "The Throne," but the heart of this album is in the final track "Pray For Me." "i 2 (eye)" is Mr. Smith's magnum opus and is essential for any CD collection be it christian or secular; a definite must have.

But even in the concerts and TV videos, a genuine, if driven and destined, person emerges from the image created by celebrity status.  We learn that Selena, who was raised speaking English, had to learn Spanish to become the empress of Latino pop music.  We see a face that, while lacking the classic beauty of a Jennifer Lopez, makes us forget such considerations because of the gigantic, toothsome smiles that constantly and spontaneously spread over its entire surface.  We hear a voice that, while not extraordinary, is assured, pleasant, and absent of the extremes of strident self-indulgence or amplified falsetto.  And last but not least we see the full, voluptuously-proportioned body and sensuous, rhythmic movements of an archetypal, yet glamorous, woman.  In comparison to the anorexic androgynes who populate today's fashion magazines and movie screens, Selena's example seems a far healthier role model for young women to follow.

Rebecca Kyle, August 2008
The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough, but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke, and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.

This record is a great many things. Quirky, eclectic, imaginative, original, unusual - all terms that could be used to describe this off-the-wall album. There's precious little here that suffers itself to be cleanly and easily categorized. 3 Legs is a surrealistic blues and Smile Away is freewheeling rock & roll, but that's about it. The rest are fusions of two or more of the following: rock, pop, blues, jazz, doo-wop, scat, folk, symphonic, prog-rock, and choral. Paul shows off his untouchable skills as an arranger and melodicist, crafting soaring harmonies worthy of the Beach Boys and sophisticated, layered tunes that surprise you at every turn and stay in your head for hours.

I don't believe I have played the LP since the early 80's, which means that I am now hearing this album with a new set of ears, guided by maturity and a more elastic idea of what constitutes good music. Bowie always found new ways to express himself, and this album, like most of his others, makes use of stylistic elements which grab your attention. In addition, the album was in the vanguard of the incipient New Wave movement: the right place at the right time.

However, Union Station's guitarist, Dan Tyminski, who sings lead on "No Place To Hide", "The Road Is A Lover", and "Blue Trail Of Sorrow", also is a strong singer.  Furthermore, Adam Steffey(mandolin), Ron Block(banjo and guitar), and Barry Bales(acoustic bass), the remaining Union Station members, really shine on this one.  The instrumental "Little Liza Jane", on which all the band members get into the act, is a driving bluegrass tune.  There's no percussion anywhere on the record, but thanks to Barry's thumping bass lines, the songs have a rhythmic, flowing feel to them, which more than makes up for the lack of a drumbeat.  There aren't any musical gimmicks here, but there is a great bluegrass and folk sound.  So Long, So Wrong is a fine collection of songs from a truly talented group of singers and musicians.

The obvious explanation would be that copies of the albums were never taken out of the boxes and put on the shelves in the record stores (remember those?), because this is an excellent album which showcases both Thompson's songwriting skill and his superb guitar work on mostly acoustic, but still some electric guitar.  The songs are still a mixture of the traditional British folk music with contemporary rock 'n' roll, but with more of Thompson's peculiar brand of dark humor coming through than before.  The ballad "The Poor Ditching Boy," "The New St. George," and "The Old Changing Way" are very much in the traditional vein, while "The Angels Took My Racehorse Away" (with the great guitar solo) and "Roll Over Vaughn Williams" are clearly representative of the modern folk-rock style.  The result is Thompson establishing his own voice as a solo artist.

In regards to his stage act, G.G. shows conflict and remorse about his extreme antics when he describes waiting to meet Bob Keeshan (TV's Captain Kangaroo) at a Border's Book Store event and being admonished by Bob Keeshan that his reputation was an inappropriate role model for kids and young adults and that he would not sign any products for G.G. and requested G.G.'s removal from the premises.
The set also includes a DVD with home video footage shot on Paul and Linda's Scottish farm used for the two music videos as well as "Ramming" a brief documentary on the making of the album narrated by Paul.
Long Haired Lady is an extended love song that's sweet, melodious and agreeable. The Back Seat Of My Car is a favorite of mine on the album. It's an anthem of young love that others don't approve of or understand. The lovers take off in his car and "may end up in Mexico City". The song reaches an enthusiastic crescendo as Paul and Linda sing in a harmonious chant.

I don't know exactly when my parents first discovered this artist, but I do know that, for as long as I can remember, the sounds of Mannheim's "A Fresh Aire Christmas" is the soundtrack to the holiday season. I can clearly recall baking Christmas cookies or putting up the tree while listening to this album, first in cassette tape, then CD form.

The players and singers he surrounds himself with are first rate and the performance showcases everyone.  What is predominately showcased is the music itself.  Comfortably Numb is one of my all-time favorite songs (or in that stratosphere of musical numbers that I consider all-time greats) and the version, actually two versions, on this DVD leave no doubt to the greatness of the song.  The arrangement of it is wonderful and includes subtleties not generally heard in rock music, and yet, it kicks butt.
South America has a real feel of exploration, its quite dark. But In the Idols Temple is an improvement- that spooky chords mark the spiders in the Indys back, plus great chrds for the famous escape.
8410	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	After the ever popular success of Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust" and "Aladdin Sane" persona's (and minus the covers only album "Pin-Ups") Bowie released "Diamond Dogs". As you may or may not know, this album was written to be made into a musical based on the George Orwell Novel "1984". David Bowie could not secure the rights to the story, thus went on to turn his efforts into an album. Many critics were hard on this album. They claimed it wasn't nearly as good as his last 2 Wonder Albums. Here is what I've come to say about "Diamond Dogs". One of the most underrated, passed on Bowie LP's.

After opening the program with a medley including "Just in Time" and "When You're Smiling," Garland introduces her guests, and both Sinatra and Martin have their musical moments and share a bit of comic banter.  But this show belongs to Garland, and she dominates it with considerable ease.

The guitar from that video is forever burned in my memory as I was amazed at how cool the solo was. Joining this young rock legend is Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots.
If you don't have this and you have everything else they did, including post-Dan solo albums, well what are you waiting for, everyone's gone to the movies!
Add this to the fact that you *cannot* argue that Maynard has a great voice, you get a great album. True it is pretentious and too many people hail Tool for being geniuses when they really just have abstract lyrics and odd interludes, but this is a great album.

After taking one look at this in a ... bar a few weeks ago, it is certain that anything original coming from anyone in music and movies today is certainly a thing of the past!  I talk to younger people all the time and I am amazed at how little they know about "history."  Not the boring history from school but just history from a lot of things.  Music, theatre, movies, books and opera-young people today know none of it!  Now before I start dating...ahem...carbon dating myself, let me just say this DVD is the bomb!  Nancy is at her all time best in this film!  She's entirely original in this and it makes a huge statement on the changing climate of 60/70's glitter fashion that so perfectly clothed the masses of the disco era.  What's funny in watching this "classic" is the uncanny similarity of Nancy's "look" in comparison to Britney Spears.  I am sure some marketing exec at the big bad record company probably saw this cheesy film and thought, wow, we could make Britney Spears into that!  Unlike Britney though, Nancy is actually a pop icon as opposed to Britney...  Buy this DVD for it's nostalgic value, it's truly a classic to behold in any DVD collection
7544	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Most people only know about the song "Parents Just Don't Understand" (and to a lesser extent "A Nightmare On My Street") from this album (and I admit so did I), but to my surprise the rest of the album is great! This is definitely "pop" rap meant for a "PG-13" audience, but that in no way means it's bad (in fact its excellent). Will Smith is a pretty decent singer - he's an EXCELLENT rapper, but his style is admittedly cheesy. The lyrics are essentially story-raps that Will Smith spits effortlessly. Another key here is that most songs have a very fun or interesting beat, and if they don't have that then they have Will Smith's lyrics and delivery which keep one's interest in the songs. If you don't think Will Smith is a capable rapper, just listen to "He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper" (the song) and tell me he can't spit. For those interested in the origins of rap or just in good fun/interesting rap songs this is a MUST buy.

4622	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The original naked lunch bohemian duo, punk jazz impurist noir explorers, Becker and Fagen, emerge from the long dark night like two Dickensian villains, to once again merge their fusion jazz smoke-filled basement speak-easy instrumentations with street sleaze dystopian lyrics and all around kick convention to the curb.  This style made Great albums like AJA and GAUCHO, produced from 70's madness with OCD perfection.  Their critical acclaim was everything they disdained and both regular bandmates and session players flew away from them like starlings in migration.  Without Citizen Dan we would most likely have never had Doobie Brothers Mark II, often dubbed Doobie Dan, and a whole lotta other improvisors both quailed and emulated at the feet of these Nephilim.
What more can be said about Alison's voice? It's clear, emotive, and haunting. My only complaint about Alison these days is that she is growing less and less inclined to cut loose on the fiddle. I've read her statements of getting away from "flashy playing for its own sake," but she's far too talented on that instrument to let it collect too much dust.
And wow, I'm amazed at the deepness of the album.  Drumming is godly in this album, and the music itself is amazing and it now puts me in a good mood rather than a bad mood.  The lyrics are great yet they don't "change my life".

There is the wonderful Roger Dean cover art, the energetic sound, and seven masterful songs. The two earliest Budgie songs I remember hearing in San Antonio are here: "Parents" and "Riding My Nightmare". The great music doesn't stop there, though, there is the definitive "Breadfan" and the excellent cover of "Baby Please Don't Go". There is the ballad, "You Know I'll Always Love You", which has a rich sound to it and "You're the Greatest Thing Since Powdered Milk". Budgie manages to once again have some strange titles and lyrics, but this time they have woven a tapestry to catch and inspire the listener's imagination.

It is 45 mins. of magic. The story is told by Chip Davis and Olivia Newton John, as parents reading a book to their children. This DVD stars Dorothy Hamill and Elvis Stojko.
The album is closed with the classic Mungo Jerry cover "In the Summertime", featuring special guests Billy Idol with whom Sherinian has been touring as of late and former Guns N' Roses axeman Slash. While it's a fun song, performed successfully, I am not sure it fits with the rest of the material. Maybe it's because Sherinian has always put out more serious songs before, but this one comes across a bit cheesy I'm afraid. There is a two-minute silence at the end before you hear the band drinking and laughing and someone angrily pounding at the door. The guy, who's supposedly Sherinian's neighbour, asks them to keep it down, but Sherinian simply says, "Take it easy, dude. We just finished Blood of the Snake". Given this context, I can see why they chose to end the album with this cover.

7849	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	Most people are probably familiar with Mannheim Steamroller for their popular Christmas music.  Sometimes they're also known as Fresh Aire for their earlier "Fresh Aire" recordings for which they had achieved a lesser degree of fame.  It's usually labeled as "new age" music, but to me that conjures images of Enya (not a type of music I enjoy).  I preferred to think of Fresh Aire as classical music with a modern twist; a blend of "baroque classical" with synthesizers against a backdrop of nature.  Imagine a small troupe of medieval minstrels playing their instruments in the woods, although one of those minstrels has a synthesizer keyboard and another has a set of modern drums!
With the exception of "Mirror to Mirror," all of these tracks are Bunnell pinned songs. For the most part this is a Bunnell solo project with limited input from Beckly. Interesting the new CD, "Here and Now," is more of a Beckly project.
Right from the start with "EVIL," the CD establishes itself as "No Nonsense." I wanted to hold her when she sang "I Cried Like A Baby." I wanted to get out of her way with "I Can Love You Like A Woman (Or I Can Fight You Like A Man)." "Queen Bee" is a trip. Pure Koko. Closing with "Come To Mama" just doesn't get any better.

For all its seemingly sophisticated studio trickery, Costello's liner notes reveal it actually took 3 Attractions to play the 1 accordion on "Long Honeymoon"...One to hold it in place, another to work the bellows, while Steve Nieve played the keyboard. So perhaps Punk is not dead after all.

With that said, it's no wonder that it turned out to be one of my favorite albums ever.  Oh, and what a great record it is... I've said before that if I had to narrow down my collection to just five cds, this would be one of the first ones I grabbed.  In fact, this IS the first album I ever picked up on cd.  The songs on here are simple, catchy, and all have a deep patriotic, but yet cynical flair that fits the working class like a glove.  In short, this is THE working man's album. Songs like "Cover Me", "Downbound Train", "Dancer In The Dark", and "Glory Days" NEVER lose their charm.
618	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	"Born in the USA", the song, was wrongly used by Reagan as a campaign anthem.  RR completely missed the message the song had, namely, the disaffection and disasocciation Viet-Nam veterans feel.  The lines: "I got nowhere to run, I got nowhere to go" have nothing to do with rah rah patriotism (sorry RR), and everything to do with a generation born, and lost, in the USA.  It is a song about quiet desperation.  We went off to war, and were forgotten.  I don't know about other veterans, but it did a lot to help me get past it all, and move on.  The video, showing maimed and wounded vets getting on with their lives, was very poignant, at least to me.

Back in the day (long before boy bands took on harmonies)SVB was (and still is) some fo the sweetest, tightest harmonies recorded.  The rich depth of some of the songs (Fallin' In a Deep Hole) is offset by fun up-tempo tunes, to keep things from getting too serious.

None of his material had punchlines, or even moments where you suddenly realise he's been spinning a yarn  or making a convoluted observation  just so he can get to the point where he'll give it an unexpected twist to jerk a reaction out of the audience.

I guess I'll just have to watch the PULSE concert on VHS until the DVD comes out, WHENEVER that will be.  I don't know if this is going to be an authentic DVD, if someone is playing a joke, or if EMI is trying to guage how many people would buy it by pre-ordering it.

The cameras moved a bit too much and sometimes, the closeup of the video that the band had playing on a screen above them would make a confusion as they switched back and forth.  I think the camera, when highlighting the video, would have been much better to keep the band in view by backing off a little on the zoom.

For those who were Fleetwood Mac fans, this should be on your priority list.  I even think the kids will sit up and take notice.  Between 1 and 10, "The Dance" gets a solid 8.

2931	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	The footage for this excellent video was filmed during the 1996 Styx tour in Rosemont, IL.  All of the hits which made Styx one of the top bands of the late '70s and 80s are included in this fine video.  Classics such as "Come Sail Away", "Renegade", and "The Best of Times" bring this video to life, but the two songs which, in my opinion, are the best of all are Dennis DeYoung's excellent rendition of "Lorelei" and Tommy Shaw's uplifting "Fooling Yourself".  Jy even gets in some keyboard time on "Lorelei", while Tommy's unmatched acoustic guitar playing shines through on "Fooling Yourself".  This video contains the original Styx line-up, minus original drummer John Panozzo, who passed away shortly before this video was released.  However, new drummer Todd Sucherman ably fills John's considerable shoes and doesn't miss a beat.  Fans of the original Styx line up will surely enjoy this look at the band in concert.
1821	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	4.0	David Bowie is a myth. A myth in the cinema and in music. He systematically played on sexual roles and he tried to look like a woman and yet be a man. This concert in Hammersmith in London shows this choice rather well in the way he dresses, he has his face made-up and he behaves on stage. The backstage scenes are not really interesting and the sequences on the audience are plainly uninteresting. The latter concentrates on girls and women as if David Bowie was a model to them : their makeup, their dresses, their hair and head-dresses, etc. But their behavior is banal and even very standard for many concerts of this type, without any frenzy. There remains the music. It is rock and roll from an older period, the seventies and the eighties. It is very rhythmic, very melodious and even at times mesmerizing, but it does not have any of the power and even violence we have become used to since then. In one word it is very moderate, though definitely charming in the melodious and harmonic arrangements. Yet the remastering must have changed a few things because I seem to remember that music as being more aggressive and more feeling-raking. David Bowie acting on the stage is rather simple though effective : he shows his shaved legs in an enticing way but we do regret the lack or loss of the hermaphrodite and ambiguous signals and messages of old. David Bowie must have aged and he has followed the politically-correct evolution of the stage. In other words, in this gay-proud period of ours, he seems to wish not to show anything that could push him into that gay territory. He did not hesitate when it was by far nor recommended but now he seems to establish a distance between this new era and him, hence the emphasis on girls and women in the audience and on girls and women in the bachstage scenes. The myth has suffered with time because it has been edited and even rewritten. So, close your eyes and dream : when he sings of his love for an unnamed  you  we can reconstruct the vision of old and the impression we experienced then : he is talking to any  you , female or male. But the visual show does not indeed. And the extras of the DVD are far ftrom being an enlarging approach of the character : we would have liked some more materials about his films and about his performance as a musician. But none of these here.

2. Strangelove (alternate take)
I feel like I'm experiencing a case of deja vu, since I had just reviewed a Blues Image double-album, and this Sugarloaf two-albums-on-one-CD deal is similar to the Blues Image package.  They are both hard rock bands that like to throw in keyboard solos and guitar solos whenever they feel like it, and they both have singers who like to mix a bit of soul with the hard rock they create.  Both the Blues Image and Sugarloaf were making music around the same time too, in the early 70's.
The conclusion: Recommended for people who love Sting or The Police or those reminiscent of (or never experienced) the early 80's music
Dear Boy - Supposed third `message to Lennon' Song with a dig at Yoko: "And when you fall in love, dear boy, it won't be half as good as this". Bouncy tune, with sparkling piano high in the mix.  Good harmony arrangement.

1.  It is a good recording of Pink Floyd and associated music.
If rock fused with electronica characterizes the first half of Low, the second half comprises the section of Low I really like, the new age instrumentals lining the second half.  "A New Career In A New Town" leads the way, with a melancholy flute-like synthesizer against a pulsing percussive beat before breaking into the synth-guitar of "Speed Of Life", wailing harmonica.

Last night I fired up our home system, then watched and listened to the entire concert.  It is an amazing event.  The talent assembled to back up Mr. Orbison points out how little I knew at the time.  The "name brand" artists who assembled to play and sing back-up are all award-winning talent!

Fixed cameras, minimal editing, accidental lighting -- not exactly a pleasure to watch.  I've always admired "Don't Fear the Reaper," but I found its performance as well as all the others on this DVD less than compelling.  My attention wandered constantly away from the screen.
The  instrumentals are also very good (although not usually my thing).  I think  the way that everybody with varying tastes in music has decided that this  is a classic really speaks volumes for the versatility and brilliance of  this album.

The concert itself is a testament to Bjork's talent; and unlike most of today's 'Pop Product Placement' groups, she revels in a world of improvisation and experimentation, and, above all things, seems to be having the time of her life. Working on her "Homogenic" album during the tour (an album B-side, "I Go Humble", appears on the playlist), Bjork performs most of her songs on "Post" and a few from "Debut" with unique spins, incorporating live instrumentation and onstage mixing in a bigger, more varied display than her later "Cambridge" concert.

Finally, a comment on some of the reviewers' observations that Christine McVie looks bored.  Yes, she's more subdued than Nicks, Buckingham, and Fleetwood.  But in a band of the eccentric and insane Buckingham and the twirling rock goddess Nicks, someone has to play it cool.

Bottom Line:  Any fan of Keith Murray, Redman, Erick Sermon, EPMD and/or Def Squad, really needs to buy this album.  5 stars.  Peace.

1346	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is funny stuff but you have to listen a bunch to catch all the connections and inuendos. You cant do two things at once while you listen and get all the great stuff.
362	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	I loved every song.  He surrounds himself with the best talent. Drummer is great
Zack Wyld is a good guitarist but he is no where near as great as Randy Rhodes or Jake E lee.  This video portrays Zack flaunting his long girly hair and hamming up the concert.
1440	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	This is so good, every single song on this CD is great,all of them.

8693	CDs_and_Vinyl_5	POS	5.0	Ok, well I heard about Bill Hicks much like many of my age did, through Tool. I started out with Relentless(because I couldn't find Arizona Bay), and loved it. It was SO funny, but there was an underlying genius to it. So I went out and found Arizona Bay. This is the best by far. I really like Rant, but there are a few conscutive tracks on it in which it picks up half way through what he's saying, and is annoying. This is more intelligent than Relentless and Dangerous, and many parts of it aren't laugh out loud funny, but rather you find yourself nodding your head and smiling. The dinosaurs in the bible skit, Officer ____ hater and as long as we're talking shelf life are the best. The musical interludes don't bother me, and if its a wohle music song I'll usually just skip it, no big deal. This is the best Hicks, and has the most longevity of any of them. Buy Arizona Bay, it will change your perspectives.
This boxed set is a tad pricey yet worth every penny and more.  We were so lucky to have Dusty in our lives and times.  If you need proof, just listen to any of these 4 CD's.  This is a compilation for the ages.
With zero weak tracks, this is perhaps the strongest beginning-to-end album that Smitty has ever recorded, except for maybe Live the Life. The production was dead on for its era, the songwriting was particularly impressive, and the timing and marketing of the album helped it connect with the public in a very real way. Looking back we can see that i 2 (EYE) was one of the best pop albums of the 1980's, it helped propel Smith's career to a whole new level, and it still stands today as one of the best projects of his career.
