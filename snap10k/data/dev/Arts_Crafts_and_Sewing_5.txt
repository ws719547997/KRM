6601	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	UPDATE: 3M did come through with a refund, they did not come thru with a solution for the problem I was having, or instructions to help contend with the new sprayer, they were more into appeasement (which is not a bad thing). Anyway I found something new out on my own. I twisted the slot horizontal, which was counter intuitive for the left-to-right-down-right-to-left zig-zag movement pattern I was going to make with my arms. It was just a try on my part, a curiosity. I got a very satisfactory result, and had that been my original experience I would have never authored this observation about the new spray tip. I presume, but haven't tried, that if I turned the slot vertical that spraying up-down-down-up would go better (again counter intuitive). I change the review from 2 to 4,holding back on the 5th star because 3M could have explained better on the can, or packed the can in a retail box with instructions, or created a YouTube example and pointed to that on the can for the sake of brevity. To leave the customers to find out by means of serendipity how to work with the new tip was asking a lot IMHO.

1421	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I was very impressed with how these came out! I bought this transfer paper to make customized tank tops for my friend's bachelorette party. I used 95% cotton 5% spandex plain white cami tanks from F21  (make sure not to get any ribbed fabric, not sure how those would turn out but I wasn't gonna risk it). I used an HP C3100 series inkjet printer on the highest quality print setting and used the photo paper setting (in my experience this prints more cleanly). I made a logo with text in Word and then, to get a mirror image (so that the iron-on was flipped correctly) I  checked the "flip horizantally" box from the print menu--no other software required! The transfer paper instructions say to place a pillowcase between the iron and the fabric, but I didn't have a spare so I just used a different tank as my protective layer. I used the cotton setting on my iron and it took probably 2 minutes to transfer a 1/4 sized page, because initially I wasn't applying enough pressure and the corner had not transferred (I actually ripped it a little trying to peel it off)--so I just pressed it down again and kept ironing. I was amazed at how well I was able to recover from my mistake. You couldn't see a tear anywhere. The results honestly looked professionally done. The image transfers a little bit lighter than it looks on your screen, but not drastically enough to make me want to go back and change anything. I was also very impressed with how legible my text was. My logo had white block lettering text with a light blue outline in size 18 font and it was crisp and legible.

I think my only complaint would be that the blades are so long. For crafting, you sometimes want a slightly shorter blade.  These are very large. Fortunately they are also light, so it isn't that much of a problem. They are maybe 2 inches longer in total in comparison to my standard scissors. (I usually buy the 3 pack scotch scissors from Costco)  They are great for long cuts but not so much for curves.

Also, a nice size for on the desk or even for working outdoors, which I do not do but I know a lot of artists do like to work in nature.  Different size holes for different size brushes but make sure not to let them stand up like that for too long as the water will erode the area around the metal where the brushes meet the wood.

5555	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I ordered five skeins of this yarn. Three in burgundy, two in buff. Buff was seriously ten times softer a than burgundy, but usually garments made out of this yarn should get a 10-20 minute soak in fabric softener,  rinsed,  then blocked. It's  half the price of other yarns, and the colors are pretty consistent.  But it is definetly easy to work with soft yarn with wooden needles, which are way more quiet than awful aluminum clanking.  For 1 cent a yard, I can deal

428	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags, they are fine.  About 95% have no problem, but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight, they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these, but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers, but they don't, so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value.

I bought these and these are the best pastels  you will ever use at this price. I am surprised they don't charge more for them to be honest. They are so smooth like lipstick that glides clean on your lips. Yes they are that smooth. They don't leave no weird flakes on your work you just glide them on your paper and they work great. I recommend using these on Oil Pastel Paper or Watercolor paper because they are messy and they need a surface that it can grab on too. I used them on Strathmore Mixed Media Paper its great for watercolor or oil pastels its pricey but if you want to create great work with these you will need that type of paper.

I know the paint trays are loose, and it it annoying, but I solved that by buying some glue dots from the craft store and placing them on the bottom of each tray. That's enough to keep them in place. As for the lack of that black, I never use black watercolour anyways; I recommend a black brush pen.

I used a white all-cotton shirt (couldn't find cotton/poly like the directions say) and the design was red with a white background. Our only difficulty came when we realized we'd have to reverse the image, since it had writing. The directions said we'd be able to find a computer command that would let us do that -- either "flip image" or "mirror image." We couldn't find that capability anywhere, even though we have an HP printer and the transfer is HP. We ended up importing the image to a photoshopping program and flipping it and printing it out from there.

As for skill level, my opinion is that this book might be a challenge for some new beginners, as there are templates (included) and Y-seams;  precision piecing skills will be a must.  But I still recommend this book for all skill levels, as I remember when I first started out I went straight to the tough stuff so I could learn everything all at once.  (In retrospect, perhaps that approach is not recommended!)  Additionally, an endless supply of fabrics - or friends with fabrics - would be helpful because each quilt allows wonderful opportunities to play with value and contrast.

Notably, this set doesn't have purple in it. Instead, it has a lot of natural colors, so it's good for painting landscapes or the like. I'll probably get the bigger 6-layer version of this to add to my next party, since it's significantly nicer than the Crayola-type children's watercolors I have around. (the difference, for newbies like me, is that the amount of water in the pigment can change the color you get, whereas the kid's watercolors got to a certain saturation and couldn't get any deeper)

One negative thing that has nothing to do with the product itself, but is with the color that shows online. For instance, "Fired Brick" on Amazon looks quite pink (to me), but is actually very red in person. Just keep that in mind when ordering!

The colors are as pictured and the yarn is of the good quality I expect from this brand. I have not yet washed it- but based on how it handles while working I expect it to wash and dry just fine- there is no indication of excessive shedding or any other cause for concern about durability. Definitely soft enough for things like a scarf that would come in contact with one's face.

I like to have sharp scissors for cutting coupons and like them to be small as they are more comfortable and easier to get between the lines. I am glad that I purchased two of them. I would say to anybody who has small hands that these are very easy and comfortable.

Ink I have from someone else when I just want to use it once, I have to wash a lot of ink off of it to put it away and that waste the ink. Ranger Tim's ink gets just the right amount on the stamp for a one time use. I love it and all my ink will now on come from Ranger Tim. Thanks

I have already completed the "Mother Moon" and I am currently working on "Father Sun" and I have to say that they are both magnificent! The colors are rich, the details are beautiful, especially the metallic thread and the beading. If you are into stitching and love to do mythical type projects, this will be your favorite book. I first borrowed it from the library and after looking through it, I had to buy it for myself.
9478	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Love the color and the feel. This is my go to yarn.
I wanted to upgrade my watercolor supplies (in past used crayola then artist loft - both of which are great for beginners and very inexpensive...but have some limitations and I was finding it difficult to get the pigments & transparency I wanted).  Read many reviews and watched YouTube and decided upon Winsor & Newton Cotman set.  Glad I got these.  I'm having so much fun painting now - it is so much easier to mix colors and get the transparency I desire.  Colors mix with water easily and glide across paper.  I guess my next investment will be in paper (I'm still using the cheapest watercolor paper I can find).  I've included a picture of the watercolor set (I haven't had it very long but I've used it a LOT).  One negative about the set is the brush.  It came with some bent bristles (you can see this in picture).  I've tried to reshape it but have been unsuccessful so far.  I've got my own brushes (a set of Royal & Langnickel synthetic sable from Michaels) that I've been using.  Paints themselves are outstanding.  Would be nice to have black and some skin tones...but I've found I can mix all of these when needed (I've included a color chart that I made).  The case is great too.  Feels sturdy and reusable.  Should be able to refill easily in future.  Expect this set to last a long time.

872	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love this set! As other reviewers said, it doesn't always stay latched, but I just use a rubber band, and I keep it in a little zip lock bag with my paper towel sheets, extra brushes, watercolor paper, etc. and it makes a nice little "kit" that way, so I'm very happy with it. I've never had a problem with it leaking, but I don't close it when it's very wet. I love that it has two cups for water, so I can keep one clean to paint with and use the other to clean my brush, and it has lots of mixing space. I even use it in my studio sometimes rather than getting my tubes out for small paintings.
Also, the small brush that comes in is really good, high quality with soft bristles and a round point, perfect for sketching, lettering or making a final art.

915	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Disapointed!!! I bought 2 based on reviews and reputation of the company and it was one of the worst watercolor art supply purchase so far. The color are so diluted with cheap fillers. I ended up using 1/4 of the pan just to get a decent depth of color for a wash and it was still light. The ugly graininess was super frustrating too. The cadmium yellow was like more light lemon yellow. This set may be cheap but not a value since I would go through it in 3 paintings. If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone! You cant give it to a child either because the colors are toxic.

Well worth the money!
The reason I'm deducting a star is because this set of crochet hooks comes with a pair of folding scissors, which I was really looking forward to having, so I didn't have to pull out my big sewing shears every time I wanted to cut my yarn. However, the mini-scissors were broken, straight out of the package. They won't fully open. One side opens all the way, but the other side barely moves. I even gave them to my husband to try, in case I was missing something obvious about how to open them, but he couldn't get them open either. So, they must be defective, which is quite disappointing.
75	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Just the right size to put on my cards for extra accent.  They shimmer really nice and just made the card look extra special

I tried all sorts of ink pads until I finally found this Distress Ink pad from Jim Holz.  It's advertised as creating "an aged look on papers, fibers, photos & more" which wasn't quite what I was looking for.  But it also works very well for coloring a raised pattern after I've run my cardstock through my Cuttlebug with an embossing folder.  Please see the customer image for a birthday card that I embossed with a graduation-themed folder, then colored with the tattered rose Distress Ink pad (the background to the main image).  Tattered Rose is more beige than rose, but I like the color.

I have used other brands, both more and less expensive, but none have matched the quality of Fiskars.
While I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.
2582	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I got this to dry sweaters on hanging from the shower curtain rod. I guess I really didn't know how small my bathroom was until this item arrived. This dryer rack takes up the length of my shower curtain rod with only 2" to spare! I like the fact it has the little clothes line around the edge to hang additional items with clothes pins. A also like the web strap underneath it fits about 2 wash cloths. The only thing I didn't like is the fact the arms of my sweaters hang off the side, I had to do a little creative draping with them. It is hard to fold the first couple of times you try but once you get used to it, it's a snap. It folds flat and small so you can easily store it.

Also note: your stitches will not be clear. They blend together due the the fluffiness of the yarn. There is very little or no space between the stitches. The width of the yarn varies so each stitch looks different. I'm not suggesting this is a drawback - just be prepared.

I sew canine male wraps and it gives me custom like options that cut pieces do not.  It has a professional finish and looks and performs great.  I like the velcro closure to appropriately fit the 5 inch wide band so that the wrap lays neatly and gives it a custom performance. It is best not to try and sew any velcro product with adhesive on it because it can gunk up the bobbin timing etc.  Use the non adhesive sew on for projects needing sewn velcro.

Included in the kit are two needles and embroidery floss. The only thing needed is a hoop and masking tape to tape the edges to prevent fraying. You can bind the edges by sewing, if desired, as the kit tells you how to do this.

Pros- It has a larger opening which heats a larger area.
1235	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	The blades themselves are fine but the box is pretty terrible.  The black plastic inserts are not securely affixed and despite lots of attempts to wedge them into place, the flimsy plastic keeps falling out over and over again.  There's a magnetic insert in the plastic part that's supposed to keep the blades in but that falls out too.  So the blades always kind of end up loose and tumbling out...?

Most importantly, I was SO DISAPPOINTED to realize these big fat markers by Prismacolor BLEED. On one page, I used all brush tip markers EXCEPT for some spots of light blue. It was a lighter color than all the others, and made by the same company, so surely (I thought) it wouldn't bleed. It did - see photos. The first photos are a page colored with the standard brush tips by Prismacolor. They didn't bleed. I used ONE of the Double-Ended Brush Tips (THIS type of marker), the light blue, and it DID bleed. The owl image is the backside of that same page. So sad. I hope this review is helpful to others considering these markers for the same purpose. Now, if you're an artist or designer, you may have a completely different experience. I found these inferior to the single-ended brush tip markers by Prismacolor... (Those are shown in the last two photos)

The container isn't anything too crazy, 6 mixing wells in the lid, white with rounded corners. The trays have a tendency to fall out when it's new and it doesn't have dried paint sticking it in place. I dropped it and these little trays of color flew everywhere along with the paint that separated from it, it was a mess.

Also make sure you keep it over the area until you see the embossing medium get shiny. Then move it to the next area you need to emboss. Be sure to use a heat resisitant surface under this while using it. The addition of an embossing gun can do a lot for your crafting projects.

I like the option of using different blades and different types of "holders" for a variety of projects such as trimming card stock for greeting cards or detailed cutting for kirigami. I also purchased the Xacto self healing mat to use with this knife set. A larger knife set is available but this is all I need for my current projects. Amazon also offers blade refills, size 11 is probably used the most by crafters. I would recommend this knife set to other crafters.

The grips are comfortable, and fit my hand well.  The motions required to operate the scissors are easy for the hand to repeat without fatigue, and the scissors are easy to control accurately while cutting.  These are all great features while using these scissors.  The sole negative that has nearly cost these scissors a full star is the locking mechanism.  It does not operate easily and I cannot operate it with one hand.  That means if I want to lock OR unlock the scissors, I have to change my grip and use the other hand to operate the lock.  This isn't convenient, and does not enhance the perception of quality in a pair of Fiskars scissors.

I ditched the Q-tip idea. The cotton just blobs into the cream and prevents a good coverage.
The only con I have about this set is that the pans although will not fall out, do slide and tip slightly do to the space between each. I am sure sticking a tiny bit of sponge between them or a dot of hot glue under the pans would be a simple fix.

I also used it to cut out the pieces to recover a set of couch pillows - 12 in all. It would have taken forever to cut out with scissors, but so fast with the rotary cutter. This one really is the right size for cutting fabric, not too big, not too small. The blade has stayed sharp after many uses, but fabric is easier on a blade than paper. I did buy some replacement blades, but I am still using the original and it has been 9 months with no decrease in cutting ease. I am thinking about buying the 28mm size for paper cutting as well

I'd previously purchased a more expensive set similar to this (like, twice as expensive) and didn't like it at all.

I have used it for a lot of different projects so it was worth getting but I didn't necessarily need to stick to the craft brand.  If I could do it over I would have probably found a cheaper one.

916	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	My sister is an artist and as I was going to take an online water color class I asked her what I should buy to get started.  She reviewed the course suggestions and was surprised that the teacher was suggesting very expensive water colors.  Since I don't even know if I'll take to this I was reluctant to buy those.  So, she suggested this set for me.  She has one and has been using it for YEARS.  She has taken it with her on many of our trips and even to Provence for a class.  She loves it and so far, I do too!  It's a great starter kit and lasts a long time!!

223	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The 11 projects in Barbara Cline's new book Simply Triangles are striking and lovely; Ms. Cline imparts a surprising amount of diversity to the humble 60-degree triangle.  First, she dresses up the conventional 6-pointed star with 7 patterns that incorporate borders, stacked strippy units, and even applique (making for a very Dresden-like star).  Next, triangles morph into flowers with 2 unique designs.  Cline ends with two Pinwheel-based projects: one is embellished with buttons and the other has a vivid tessellating appearance.  Each project includes a short "Life Lessons" box illustrating the huge influence on the author of her Mennonite family.  Photographs are in abundance, and highlight the exceptionally nice quilting details.  Both traditional and contemporary quilters will find something very pleasing here.

I've been using these with my fabric crafts for over a year now, and I love them. The spring action makes it much easier to cut large amounts of fabric without tiring your hand and arm, and these scissors provide for both a strong (multiple layers of fabric) and precise cut without any fraying of the material. I especially like the little orange slide button safety feature that holds the scissors closed with not in use, and the flat bottom of the scissors slides perfectly along my quilting mat and means that I don't have to lift the fabric very high in order to make my cuts (which also helps with precision).

I rely very heavily on customer reviews on Amazon when I am making a choice to purchase something.  I try to read as many as I can before making my final decision.  I know that some people out there hate to see a disclaimer in a review that states that an item was purchased at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review because they feel that the review cannot be trusted.  In fact, you will see that disclaimer on many of my purchases.  However, this review does not have that disclaimer and I do my best to ensure that all my reviews are are fair, reasonably comprehensive, and that they do offer some value even *if* the product was purchased at a discount.  I do not want to be the "reviewer-who-can-not-be-trusted" and that is why all opinions are my own and are in no way compromised.

They feel a little chalky once they've dried upon the paper, but only the darker blue shade seems to come off only fingers when touched. The smell of these is great. Not important at all, but it's just a pleasing detail about them. One of the things I thought was great is that one disc has only primary colors grouped together: red, yellow, blue, white, black. I would definitely buy these again simply because it's a compact way to take my colors around. Get a set of aqua brushes to go with, and you'll be all set.

Be sure your hands and the ruler are clean before starting. Be sure to put the same side against the ruler as was against the paper. Don't stretch it, don't mess with it, don't fuss: it doesn't have to be perfect. It should be at least a quarter inch smaller than the ruler on every side, but can be even smaller than that. Doesn't even have to be the exact shape of the ruler, though you'll have better luck if it does cover most of it. Just put it on, smooth it out, and you're good to go.

I do a lot of sewing, so, whenever I need to order something small (only a few dollars) in order to meet the 'free shipping' minimum, I'll order a spool of thread.

This batting is generously sized--I could almost use it for a double bed quilt--but it's easy to handle, and it was very easy to pin the quilt layers together. I had to trim the batting a little, but I saved the trimmings for use in another project. The batting isn't very thick or heavy, but I think the quilt will be very warm/

Final Thoughts:
6450	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	It was great for a birthday party.  Purchased it for my daughter to help out at a 2 year birthday party.  It was easy to use and apply.  The only hard thing was getting the little plastic covers off the paints.  I should have opened it earlier to have all the little plastic wraps taken off earlier.
8288	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Sadly the case didn't make it through many uses.  The fasteners are so thinly made they are useless.  I have found the oils take a really long time to dry.  I won't be back.  :(
1846	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I love these. Prismacolor double ended art markers are the best markers to me so far that I have brought.  The colors are bright and bold.
2938	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	This is my second time purchasing this item and for whatever reason they just don't hold up.  The punch dulls very quickly and the mechanics give out.
2166	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	If you make anything with paper, these little scissors are indispensable! I'm hard on my scissors, cutting everything from paper to plastic to wire... whatever needs to be cut. I bought 2 of these to save for just paper crafts as they're small and precise. I'd buy them again.

For kids interested in art or casual hobbyist, it's really a nice set. Everything arrived intact, but the dummy can't be put together. I got what I expected. No complaints.  The case is not one I expect to use to transport supplies continuously, it's best for sitting on a shelf between uses.

8707	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Just received this foot and already have it in use.  I'm new to sewing and quilting, so anything that helps me do a better job of maintaining a straight, 1/4 seam is helpful, and this does a great job.  I'm currently working on small 1/4 triangles and the long narrow opening leading up to the needle is perfect for lining up my mark and keeping it straight.
7375	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	wonderful color, love using it
5187	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I have been looking everywhere for this color. Shipping was very fast. I am very grateful and satisfied!
2084	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These arrived quick and fresh too. They are still flexible and soft, making them excellent for my drawing and sketching. Many times I have purchased them during school supply sales and didn't realize how often and requested they are for art until I start taking a class recently. This is a artists favorite and well like I said these were fresh and flexible, soft which are highly needed in drawing and sketching with pencils.
CONS: These markers WILL BLEED through. You need to know that. My coloring book is one sided (meaning there are no images on the backs of the pages) so it didn't bother me, but I know this will be a problem for a lot of people. Because they are so fine tipped, if you end up accidentally going over a line an extra time or two, it will create those little fuzzy patches of paper (I think this happens because when the paper gets wet from the ink saturation and then has a marker dragged on top of it, it moves some of the wet paper fibers around). The colors don't always match the caps very well.
4314	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Good feel, no kinks and soft.
4053	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great quality as expected. I didn't notice any weird fraying or knots halfway through. The color was just as expected (I had bought some previously from JoAnn's and needed a refill.) Used it to make a tree skirt (see picture). It's a nice old-fashioned Christmas red. Obviously, it IS economy yard - a bit bulky and rough - but unless you're making something that needs to be more sleek, this suits very well. Plus, the color options and price make this a great option as well.

I needed two skeins to finish an afghan started several years ago. I like Red Heart yarns for their ease of use, warmth, and the Painted Desert color blend is beautiful!
6191	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I knitted a large ottoman and I wanted something firm to fill it with. This fit the bill nicely. I rolled it up and folded it and stuffed my ottoman. Very firm with a little give, and nice to know that it's all natural.

5325	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Nice heavy duty needle threader. I use it for yarn to tie in threads and crochet thread that's too heavy to use a regular needle. Good quality and much cheaper than anywhere close to me!
4589	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great
140	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Saw this product in one of my Craftsy quilting classes. Having been a paper piecer for 25+ years, I was interested.  How wonderful to be able to draw/print foundations and be able to see sewing lines through the vellum for easier placement and more precise pre-cutting of patches. I think that this product  may be too expensive for a large project - newsprint or very thin copy paper is almost as good - but if money were no object, I would use it exclusively. If money IS an object, buy one pack for use on really small or otherwise challenging pieces. You may get hooked!
I should have bought a couple just for back ups.
Fast Shipping!!

4145	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is the seam ripper I remember from my childhood. I wish I could say I don't use it often..but that would be a lie. I do have other seam rippers that have the magnifying glass and light attached...I don't use those very often. They are clunky and a little hard for me to work with, this is the best, the metal doesn't bend like with other seam rippers I've owned in the past. And yes the pointy one is sharp and you have to be careful not to rip a hole in your fabrics.
6014	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This was a very easy and quick  kit to work. Even if you have never done needlepoint this kit is very easy.
2999	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	1.0	Disappointed.  It cannot punch through light cardstock at all.  Even after I punched through a sheet of aluminum foil a dozen times, it punched through looseleaf paper raggedly, roughly, unreliably.  I had trouble pulling the puncher out of the looseleaf paper after making a hole!  Messy holes.  I expected better from a Fiskars product because they have such a long and stolid reputation for their cutting tools.

3935	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Just as expected.  Arrived quickly.
3178	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I gave this yarn 5 stars. 1.) For ease of access. Not only on Amazon but also found at Walmart, Target, Michaels, Joanns, and Hobby Lobby. So, if you run out the day before having to gift the item your crafting you don't have to wait if shipping. 2.) Price. This is not expensive yarn. 3.) Quality. It lasts! Colors do not bleed. Does not fade. It is easy to care for. Quite soft once washed. 4.) Variety of colors! 5.) Free patterns! They are quality patterns that work up nicely.

4319	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great for making scarves.
5865	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	With my Prime shipping account I got free 2-day shipping on this yarn and at $2.79 sale price making the price very comparable to Wal-Mart. I was able to get enough skeins to finish my project all at one time in the same dye lot. I do wish there wasn't a 4-skein limit on yarn though, and also that I could order yarn without having to buy it as an add-on item. I loved that each skein of yarn is individually packaged in a sealed heavy plastic bag. I've never seen such good care taken of a yarn product by anyone. Thanks Amazon! Though a bit rough, this yarn holds up well for afghans and softens up a bit after washing. Solid colors have no dye lot, and I really haven't noticed a color difference in different dye lots in the multi-color lines. Using the camo, I've crocheted dog sweaters, afghans, and men's winter scarves.
5173	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Just as expected. Easy to work with. Color true.
P.s. - If you go to a specialty site dedicated to yarn crafts, like Love Knitting, Red Heart is pretty low down on the list of "most loved" worsted weight yarns. Not a good sign.
9701	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered this for my sewing notions. It arrived damaged. Upon inspection I noticed that the hinges are not very sturdy and are part of the lid; in other words, they are hinged with very thin plastic. This will not be very durable as the plastic will "fatigue" and bread very quickly. Returned and chose not to re purchase
7789	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Awesome paint. I find them really good quality. Smooth, thick like butter, mixes very well to make other colors, to make new ones. They are Acrylic paints.

4754	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	great
3161	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	Great quality Red Heart Super Saver yarn as usual. I bought 10 skeins of different colors. I took off 1 star for the price. My local craft store sells this size Red Heart skein for $4.99 each, but doesn't have 112 colors!! Great color selection, free shipping, just a bit pricey.
766	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Small but perfect for painting on the go.
But this set has the upside of being fully customizable. You can arrange the colors anyway you like or change it out for others. If you want to use your favorite tube paint just squeeze into the pan and let dry.

The quality of the product itself is very good. Especially for a child. They are a very fun art supply. The colors are nice and they lay smooth and creamy. I will definitely buy these again when the time comes.
6091	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Wanted sinethingbas a liner for burp rags.  This works perfectly.  Makes them a bit thicker and excellent for absorbency

7335	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Paints are dark and richly pigmented.
If you don't like working with sport weight, use it as a second strand to introduce more color to your project or add a touch of softness.

4865	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	The price was excellent and I did not realize how much I got for one pound.  I am making an afghan now, and will enjoy making more things with what I have left over.  The yarn is durable - you cannot break it with your hands, as some yarns are. (I do that when my scissors are not handy).  I am impressed with that as well as with its feel - not dramatically soft and furry, but great for an everyday afghan. Will stand up to many washings.
5762	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I so love to crochet!! ... and what is better than crocheting? Getting the yarn for a really good price!!!  My only wish is that the texture of the yarn would not be so rough!! and SO many knots in the skein! :( ... but other than that.... I LOVE IT!
5308	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This was just as I expected it to be. I have been purchasing this yarn for many years at local stores. This is the same good yarn.
1125	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	VERY nice set of handles and extra blades.  This is my first set and I haven't had any issues with it.  The zipper case was hard to zip closed the first time because the zipper was rolled outward but once it was closed I haven't had any problems.  The magnetic feature holding the blades is very nice too.

7568	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I cut leather and this is the best of 5 different ones i have tried! It has a sturdy steel support for the blade that is not easily damaged like other brands i have tried, since i do apply a lot of pressure to cut the first thing that gets damages is always the steel support for the blade that attaches the blade to the plastic handle.

5871	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a very vibrant and consistent type of yarn. It's perfect for bright scarves or amigurumis (toys). It is a bit expensive on Amazon though (I would suggest buying it from Walmart or Hobby Lobby!). Overall a great yarn for beginners and experts alike!

4387	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I'm a beginner sewer and was told I would need this for all the mistakes I'd make.  Yes, yes indeed, I did.  At first it seemed cumbersome, but once I practiced and got the hang of it I was ripping seams left and right in no time flat.  It doesn't clearly explain this to dummies like me that you use the sharp end to cut individual threads if need be, but you actually put the blunt end on the bottom and the U-shaped part does all the seam cutting.  The sharp end on the bottom will rip your fabric!  The red nubby thing protects the pieces of fabric from tearing.
4099	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	A must for your sewing kit.
The tiny brush is too tiny, suggest getting a bigger one.  The pallet has worked for me in my playing around.

7309	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	FINE
Overall, this is a pretty great recipe journal. There are certain things that aren't necessarily perfected and could use improving, but they are all mostly minor and the pros most definitely outweigh the cons.
7329	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	These a really nicely packaged and so pretty.  I can't comment on how well they go down on paper because they are a gift for Christmas.  I have a budding artist granddaughter and am trying to encourage her to continue in all phases of art.  These will go with a set of brushes and a water color art pad.  I like that they take up a small amount of space in the storage area as we are rapidly running out of room on her desktop.  I'm sure she will like the unique way in which they are presented as well.  Something a little different from the ordinary. The price was good I thought....though I am not well versed on what good water colors should cost.  I'm still drawing stick figures in my old age.

7425	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a very good price for Olfa blades which tend to be expensive.  Also, the pinking blades cannot be sharpened, like the plain blades, but are great for cutting strips for rag rugs.  The pinking edge keeps the strips from shredding as much as they do with the usual straight blade.

5795	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is very camouflage looking, which I like a lot. Maybe a little more so than the actual camouflage colored yarn. I like making afghans and pillows with it for me and other people so I use this color a lot. And it holds up ok if I have to undo and redo something. And it just gets a little fuzzy in the wash so far. Wish it was cheaper.
1183	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product for anyone who is constantly cutting, regardless if it paper, chipboard, or leather. I use for all types and so far I am really pleased with it. It stores all the blades really nicely with a magnetic backing so that even when you place the knives in there prospective "groove" the magnetic keeps them stationary. Very clever and convenient. I has a pouch or "net" that holds refills which also is handy. Overall, I am very happy with this set. I allows you options for whatever detail work you are doing. For me personally the #2 is a God send because it is strong enough to handle leather work or rather the leather work I do. I create jewelry with leather and the #2 knives cuts it like butter. I was using the #1 knife out of sheer ignorance until I finally made the effort to seek out something that did not make me work so hard to cut my leather. Anyway...this storage unit is SOLID and even if you drop it it is all good just because of how it is designed and the magnetic mechanism along with the actually construction of the case which is SUPER hard. I give this 6 stars if I there was a sixth category!!!!

3389	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	Great yarn for beginners and experienced knitters alike. The vivid colors add a pop to any project, and the yarn is relatively soft, making it great for scarves and other cool-weather wear. I knit a scarf in stockinette stitch with this, and I would say the color led to an interesting pattern of stripes in it.

5417	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I use this yarn a lot since I 'self taught' myself to crochet. Red Heart does really well for the wobbly looking things I make. I am doing a little better though. I have used this yarn and made some pretty decent caps and pot holders. The yarn products that I have made wash well and make it through the dryer. That made me happy. The afghan I am attempting with Red Heart is going well. The colors are nice and the yarn feels good on my fingers as I diligently crochet. By the way, crocheting keeps you from eating while you watch television, too. I recommend Red Heart especially for beginners like me because it does well and it does not hurt your budget terribly. It is a very good product.
6803	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	5.0	I got this and another color to make felted dryer balls and one skein was the exact amount I needed to make 3 of a pretty good size. They felted up incredibly well.  Very happy with my purchase.

When it does melt the embossing powder, the heat is so indirect and sporadic, I'm aiming it over a section that still needs to melt, but it's actually reheating ANOTHER area thats already melted! Which means the EP is overheated and is flat and scorched and ugly.
2557	Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing_5	POS	4.0	I liked the fact there were many sizes in this package, as my husband uses them for his many garage projects, and then throws them away after the one-time purpose.  They would not last a second time.

The web site for the Artisan line from W&N is explicit and provides many answers to what these products are and how to use them.  It made my decision easier.  They are also environmentally good.  These are oils, the chemistry is only changed slightly to have a "tail end" which is water soluble; once the colors dry the oil remains and it has the same chemical features of standard oils.

My 3-year-old has gotten this paint everywhere: the carpet, wood floors, his and my clothes, his sister's hair. It's come out of everything with a little bit of water and very little scrubbing. I also like the fact that it's non-toxic since it's made of organic compounds, so even if it ends up in his mouth (which it has), it's not a big deal.
