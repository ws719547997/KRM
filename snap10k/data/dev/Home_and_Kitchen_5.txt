Historically he's made them by either beating, which he doesn't like because they can get over mixed in some spots and still be a bit lumpy in others, or by using a masher, which is slow. He makes mashed potatoes often as he has a few recipes, primarily horseradish, garlic, country and "normal". It's always a favorite when we take them to dinner at his parents. And of course, cold the next day is something I like. And he likes to take the day-old  and make some kind of shepherd's pie.

The hose material is thinner, and less durable.


A "zester" allows you to create fine strips of peel from lemons, oranges and other citrus fruits. It is essential for all cooks if you want to remove lemon peel for a Lemon Meringue Pie or for orange peel if you are making Orange Butter.

We barbequed some ribs in it the first day it arrived and they were delicious.  The usage directions were clear and easy to follow.  True to my expectations the meat just fell off the rib bones and the sauce flavor thoroughly permeated into the ribs as I expected.  This aluminum pressure cooker is durable and due to being constructed of aluminum the heat is readily conducted into the cooking chamber rather than being made of stainless steel which takes a longer time to heat.  I would definitely recommend this Presto pressure cooker to anyone considering the world of pressure cooking as a great introductory appliance and thanks to Amazon the delivery was prompt and the price was right.

5445	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This vacuum is everything I ever wanted in a portable battery operated model.  The battery stays charged for all my hard floors and I still have an extra battery if I needed it but so far have no need for one.  I have a cordless B&D vacuum and I thought that was nice but would not hold a charge for more than 10 minutes.  I would always have to plug it back in and do the rest of the hard floors the next day because it took so long to charge.  The Quick Up is also good for throw rugs.  Can't say enough good things about it. Also it is $30.00 cheaper on Amazon than other websites I checked.
The handle is shorter than most mashers, allowing superior leverage.  Plus, the size and design of the mashing head allows the potatoes to freely squish through the masher, making it easier and not allowing overmashing.  The potatoes are mashed perfectly.
 No need to use a mixer. I highly recommend this product, and trust OXO Good Grips.
The only negative about these is they are quite heavy, making them a luxury item in my backpack.

She told me about the Mighty Mite, asked me to get it.  She's happy, do I'm happy.  Even hit a second one for the first floor. Amazing quality for the price.
2954	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	In my opinion, this cooker is a poor value for the money.  I have several pressure cookers, and this is probably my least favorite to use -- I actually don't enjoy cooking with it at all.  Its very basic, with an old fashioned weighted pressure release, clunky to close, and the cheap plastic handle is not attached very securely.  I have had some problems with the safety latch, which doesn't seat properly, and allows pressure to escape, making it difficult to bring the pot to temperature.  Most importantly, for just a bit more money, much better pots are available.
I tried using my other potato masher for these purposes and it did not work - to much pressure at too few spots and everything came out all wrong.  If you like your mashed potatoes really smooth - this works great.  Just don't forget that it works fantastic for other foods, too.

4487	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm surprised at the power this little cordless has! It picks up the dirt, dog hair and even little pebbles. A single battery lasts a long time, and with the spare battery ready, I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept. (I'm more a gardener, not a cleaner, so if it's not easy it probably won't happen.) Some cons: the filter case is a little difficult to remove, it would be nice if the "on" button was up on the handle instead of down on the base, and although the stick comes off for stair cleaning, it doesn't have a "Dust Buster-like" snout like, say the Electrolux Pronto (which doesn't have the same power). It does clean so well, I'd recommend getting a spare filter or two (they're cheap) so you can rinse one out and have another ready. I'm so glad I got this!
684	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	This device is crude. I was attempting to replace my Brookstone opener, which broke after 3 years. The Brookstone device is solid, but it does have moving parts.  This one looked sturdier. Nope it isn't. It doesn't have the feel of being made out of steel -- maybe a lighter alloy.  It arrived in a plastic box, holding a plastic jig to hold it, and an extra screw. The device to remove the foil is made of plastic (The brookstone one is steel, still works). I managed to get the cork out using the tool, but then it was impossible get cork off the corkscrew.  The method of clamping the cork while pulling lever doesn't work.  I guess didn't realize how good the Brookstone device was. I am returning.
We only use this vacuum downstairs on our tile flooring and to vacuum carpeted steps so the use level is average to below average.  With that in mind, this vacuum should have been more than enough to handle the job.  However, it seems the manufacturer has used some really cheap plastic and parts in an attempt to keep the cost down and/or the profit up.  I never expected this to perform like a $200 hundred dollar vacuum, but it should at least be able to perform to minimal standards.  Even though the suction seems adequate, the rest of the unit is so cheap that it now truly makes vacuuming a chore.  I would have imagined that for as little as 10 dollars more they could have made this unit much more acceptable and pleasant to use.

Suction is excellent. It's adjustable for vacuuming throw rugs. Wands simply pull apart -no tabs to lock together- which makes it faster when you want to add a brush. Wands are made of plastic rather than metal & I've found they attract dog fur through electrostatic energy. So, I gave them a spraying with "Static Guard" & voila - no more fur sticking to them!

5172	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Psychologically, I believe we as a society are co ditioned to believe that heavy equipment does a better job.  That is not the case.  I purchased this while pregnant tibe able to vacuum my house and stairs.  It gets the job done.  I find myself still pushing down and looking for those lines in the carpet but this isn't that kind of vacuum.  I'm 5'1.5 and find myself bending over aa bit when using this.

Also found that I need to cook usually less time than it is in cookbook. Made in China, but quality is outstanding and overall construction is very sturdy and will last long. I feel it safe enought also, they are 3 different systems integrated so it will not blow in your hands. With no doubt, must have item for every house. I'll get 6-Quart Presto sometime soon to coock large quantities which I will pack using FoodSaver and store in the freezer. It definitely worth every penny and I can't believe it cost only $30.

When sealed the Pressure cooker did not leak and heated up very quickly. Just follow the guide, Heat fast (on high heat, that is a key to Pressure cooking, get the temp. up fast, as fast as you feel safe with, the Pressure cooker can take the heat). When the pressure relief valve has begun to dance at a steady pace, lower the heat until you see a steady but slower movement. At that point you start your cooking time.

5391	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Nice to see a company still sell something that worked so well instead of replacing it with a cheaper model.  Had one that lasted 5 years. I used it about everyday. Batteries finally started slowing down. Best suction and long lasting battery. It even gives you two so you can rotate them. Great idea! Only reason I didn't replace it with the same is my husband bought be a different brand. It was horrible. I loved this one. I probably will buy another one.
1259	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking. It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well. As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well. The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up. An addition of something solid (perhaps an onion or a some butter) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time.

Once the battery dies in the electrolux, it is cheaper to throw it away and buy a new one. With the Eureka not so. Batteries can be changed out just like the once that are found on most cordless tools. Using it mostly on non carpeted floors where my two large furry dogs roam. Does the job well.
This OXO pizza wheel is really nice!  The stainless handle and blade won't rust or break, and it's dishwasher safe.  The handle is nicely shaped for comfort, and has a rubbery insert for a safer grip.  The thumb protector is a nice addition - I think we've all slipped while using a kitchen tool and cut ourselves at least once.

Each opener I have bought annually over the past five years seems to wear out; and this time I looked closely at old vs new.  The connection of gears seems to deflect over time, leading me to believe metals used aren't of high quality and so the gear connection just becomes impossible after a few dozen uses.

The only con I can find is that the rack sits relatively low to the bottom of the pan compared to other racks out there. My solution to this is to simply flip the rack. While this pushes the rack position much higher, you won't have to worry about your food getting soaked in the drippings. You may want to consider adjusting your oven rack to account for proper spacing.

I followed the guidelines for cooking dry beans and noticed that they can use a couple more minutes more of cooking than the cooking book suggests, just make sure you have plenty of stock or water or it will burn the bottom.

It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads, sandwiches, or freezing.  Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.  This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.

The belt arrived promptly and I implanted it into the unit.  In the process, dirt from as far back as 1942 was released into my home causing near white out conditions but I managed to conclude the operation.  Gasping I turned on the machine and in moments the near toxic environment was replaced with clean fresh air, dust free and smelling of pine. I proceeded to capture the paper circles and made life bearable once again.  Eureka!!!!

Lot of fun for recreational learning, too.
My experience of this vacuum is, as others have said, it is only for hard wood floors, tile and linoleum.  The hose is kind of cheap, so you have to be careful/gentle with it.  The vacuum is awesome for specific purposes, but trying to use it on carpet and more intense jobs will wreck the vacuum.  I really like it for the hard wood floors though.  I had given it one star, until I unclogged the hose, now I realize it does work and you can fix the suction issues.  But you have to keep this vac just for specific purposes.  Need a different vac for other jobs.

All in all, I'd say this is well named and an excellent buy.  It seems well made too and I hope to get a lot of wear out of it.
  The only con to this device is that it is straight aluminum - no stainless steel coating.  This makes cleanup harder and it stains easily.

1110	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Worked just fine for what I needed it for. Minced like a pro and I love the pulse function on this machine. If you hold the buttons down, yes you will end up with puree. But this is not a model that you have to do that. You can pulse chop. And it has a high speed and low speed function. Worked beautifully. I've been using mini choppers for a while, but this one was by far the easiest for assemblage, use and clean up. No need to turn the entire bowl for the chopping process to work or a million dials. Really easy to use.
Anyhoo, I'll try to upload an in-action photo. You'll see bare burner sticking out underneath the base, streaks down the side from where the water's run out under the lid, and the red button sticking up -- after I'd forced it into position. Honestly, if I could have a do-over, I would have gotten a different pressure cooker -- the cool extra handle hasn't been worth the frustration.
I am an asthmatic and using any device that makes my life easier is a big plus!  For that alone, I would recommend the Eureka Mighty Mite!

5723	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Does a a very good job.  The hepa filter solves the dust problem when vacuuming and the cord is very long.

I taped over mine to hold it in place.

My main issue is that all the ingredients in a recipe will be cooked for the same amount of time, so that some of them will be overcooked. A workaround is suggested. Items like vegetables which take less time to cook than the main meal cooking in the pressure cooker, can be prepared seprately in the normal way, and then added to the rest of the meal. A few minutes of cooking will then blend in the flavors.

You simply place the amount of arugula that you need in the colander portion of the product and place it into the large bowl it comes with.  Fill it up with cold water and let it sit for about 5 minutes or so.  Remove the colander and empty the water from the bowl.  Reinsert the colander in the bowl and repeat the process until you are satisfied that the salad leaves are clean.  Empty the drained water again and reinsert the colander.  Place the lid on the bowl and colander and press the spinner plunger.  You will be amazed at how fast the colander spins and how it quickly it removes the excess moisture from the arugula.
They sold out at the local Sam's club in a few hours at the same price as here.  I haven't seen those returned and on the shelves again.  Great Heater!

2789	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I don't think I've very had a pressure cooker I didn't like. Except this one. The handle remains loose even when I've tightened the screw. The emergency pressure release valve came off when I hand was the lid. The pressure valve on the handle piece sticks. I'm disappointed. It's got a good, solid base. It's a good size for a lot of the smaller cooking tasks I have. But overall the pressure aspects and the loose handle make it less than I had hoped for.
I suspect this should just be on my annual Christmas list and get a new one every holiday season...

I turned off the stove and allowed the cooker to cool. When I opened it there was an inch of burnt matter stuck to the bottom. This happened a week ago and I am still trying all kinds of home remedies to get rid of the grime. I was well aware of the instructions, which said not to use too little water or the food will get burnt.

If you're reading 5 star reviews, it may be because the reviewer hasn't owned this vacuum for very long.... At first it I thought it worked great, and would have gladly given it 5 stars. It was nice having 2 batteries for longer jobs. Over time the batteries held less and less charge. It would be so that after only 5 minutes I'd have to replace the battery with the other one in the charger. I every time I vacuumed I'd run the battery out and it would charge for at least 12 hours before using again. Today was it's last vacuum. The battery in the vacuum died quickly so I went to  replace it with the one in the charger and that too died within 30 seconds.... Switching back to a corded vacuum with an extension cord.

9588	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this today to strain my homemade yogurt. While it holds about 4 cups ultimately (waited a bit for some of the whey to drain, then added more), it allowed more "white" to wash into the "clear yellow" whey than I would have preferred...I think.  I'm planning to start making ricotta cheese from the leftover whey and I suppose that would capture the white milky yogurt that washed thru and convert it to ricotta.  My yogurt usually isn't really runny before straining, either.  However, after I strained the yogurt to the desired consistency, I took the remaining whey and sent it thru the gold mesh coffee filter and that captured most of what had escaped this OXO strainer.  It IS a good quality.  It IS large...so large in fact, I'm not sure how I'd put it in the fridge overnight to make yogurt cheese.  It would be helpful in the kitchen in other ways but where do I keep it in my very small kitchen?  It's probably going back for a more compact model of yogurt strainer that'll fit in the fridge.

Fittings seem cheaply made, the rug function is marginal, and the hose is about as thin/delicate as I've seen.

5462	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	After I charged both batteries for the first time, I thought I would need both batteries to vacuum my family room. I have 2 dogs & 5 cats so you can imagine the hair that may accumulate if neglected. I love the ease of no electrical cord to drag around or trip over. This little power vac picks up all the dander & hair from the carpet & throw rugs with out moving them around. You will have to empty the canister more often, obviously because it's half the size of a big vacuum. It's so light weight, I was surprised how much debris it collected for it's size. I finished my family room and my battery pack was going strong so I continued vacuuming the hallway... bathroom, then the living-room... dining-room... kitchen (also equipped to vacuum bare floors)... and finally slowed down at the stairs. So essentially, one battery was enough power to clean the entire bottom floor of my house, about 1400 sq ft. So, I rotate the batteries each time I vacuum to keep the batteries functioning well. Best stick vacuum for your money!

2879	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Well it a Great Pressure Cooker. Easy to assemble and does what it says. Only down side I found it to have is unlike the Indian Pressure cooker you don't have Whistle and cooking is based on how much time you left it inside. Which kind of takes getting used to and you can tend to make mistakes where you over cook it!
7524	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	As a culinary historian and author of CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, THEIR STORIES, CULTURE AND CUISINE, I use these bag grips for much more than in the kitchen. Yes, they are handy to have in the kitchen, they stick to a refrigerator and the side of a stove. I use them to grab all sorts of items I need to keep handy when I am testing antique recipes... oven mitts, notes, recipe cards, small bags of spices.  And then there are the general uses, the logical ones that come to mind...closing bags of chips and crackers. BUT WAIT! Let's not restrict Good Grips Bag Clips to the obvious...I use them in my office...just as they stick to a refrigerator they also stick to a metal file cabinet...great for messages, outgong mail and "TO-DO" lists.

This is a nice set of silicone scrapers and so far I am very happy with them. I suspect they will last quite a while longer than the others I have used.

990	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	Good quality. I wish it had been just a little longer. I didn't guess close enough on what I needed. I cooked a 15 lb prime rib in it first and it was not quite long enough to fit it without rolling it a bit and squishing it in. But that is not the fault of the pan. The amount of space between the rack and the pan could be a bit more as it fills up pretty quickly with a big piece of meat. and the handles on the side to lift the rack out are not really easy, when hot, to get a hold of to pull it out. Overall I do like the pan and have used it for several other things.

3394	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	5 stars.  Why?
6599	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	It's a fan...it works.
5392	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This was one of the worst purchases I ever made. The batteries last only one cleaning. After storage for a week or so, they are flat and need to be recharged. Avoid.
1735	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have bought 4 of these bins for my daughter's open shelving in her play room. I bought 2 a couple of months ago and I liked them so much I bought 2 more. I got the pink ones with the white rope handles. I'm happy to report that the color of the bins in real life is the same as the photo online.
A tip: when searching for a cordless vac, don't just look at the voltage. Higher voltage marking does not necessarily mean more suction, as is in this case: the Eureka uses only 6V, less than half of the 14.4V of DD! What rules is a good system design and good parts used in the product.
637	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this heater months ago thinking that I would try it in between the seasons, but the winter season in GA was cut short and this unit stayed in box unopened, unused until this week. User friendliness gets 5 stars. Just removing the heater from the box, rip all the plastics off and plug it in. I set it in the 17' x 20' living room where it leads to open kitchen, hall way and the stair case. I wanted a heater I could use before I officially turn on the centralized heater which blasts through the entire house. This heater does the job. There is no annoying sound, no burning odor at the first time plugging it in as some previous posts suggested, I keep it on lower heat and never leave it on unattended ... meaning that the unit is ON when I am in the room where I could see it. I have 4 cats and I don't take any chance with any appliances whatsoever. Would my cats ever decide to jump or lean on it to cause it to tip and fall on the floor? Maybe. As far as I know, the unit has auto timer but not auto-shut off feature when and if it tips over. If you are looking for a heater with such feature to shut-off automatically as some other units being sold at much higher price, obviously this one is not for you. It all depends on what you are looking for in terms of buying a space heater. My budget to be spent for a heater was no more than $60 and I am glad I bought this Lasko model 5160. As soon as you turn it on, it starts disbursing warm air out but the enclosure seems to stay cool to touch. That is the most important feature for me when it comes to space heater that the unit itself doesn't get HOT.

2194	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Quick review: I really like this vacuum. I was surprised at the quality . . . and at how well it does what it's supposed to.
1207	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Got this item and worked great the first time....then I made another butter paste a month later and it did not work. The motor died on it. Then I came on Amazon to see how I can return it and come to find out it had only a 30 day warranty which I missed 3 days out. This is "JUNK" and a lot of money has been lost due to this return policy! Do not get this item...I also believe that when customers are dissatisfied with their products a company should respond and correct these issue quickly. I do hope Amazon does not try to play the silent and ignore the problem GAME like "Wal-mart"!
4067	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is an excellent Pressure Cooker.  It works perfect on my Induction Cooker.  This is my second Presto Pressure cooker, the first one had wooden handles, and was made of aluminum (still in service).  Aluminum not being compatible with Induction Cooking I got the Stainless Steel.  The encapsulated bottom creates that perfect heat distribution for searing and browning.  What an absolutely beautiful combination.  The new sealing ring is a wonder all by its self when compared to the ones of the 1940's.  Do I sound happy with this cooker, That's because I am.  The first thing I cooked was a pot of Pinto beans,(see photo) the pressure cooker cooked them 14 times faster than a conventional pan.  Clean up is a breeze, and to keep that just out of the box look I use Bar Keepers Friend. During assembling, use caution when attaching the handle to the lid as I twisted off one of the screws, which is not a problem or deterrent as Presto has great customer service, and sent a complete new replacement assembly.  I shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future.  Thanks to Amazon.com for a fantastic buy.  All Pros and No Cons.  This review was written assuming the reader knows a little bit about Pressure Cooking.  Pressure Cooking is Fast, Fun, and Flavorful.  :)
6787	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This item is a bit of a joke.  I loaded it in my SUV then went over rough roads and a lot the lemonade came out the top and ran all over.  The top should seal tightly!
4725	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this cooker 6 months ago from amazon for $35, and frankly, although the reviews I read on this product all said that it's great, I was very skeptical about the $35 price tag and was not expecting much.  On top of that, both my mother and my mother-in-law warned me that cheap pressure cookers are dangerous, and I *must* buy something more expensive for safety reasons. I am just very glad that they were both wrong!

6774	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I bought this Lasko box fan from a home improvement store to blow some of the brutal heat and humidity away and it worked well.  I needed a second fan to cool off my home office and purchased another brand at a retail store.  That one didn't work nearly as well so I returned it and ordered this Lasko from Amazon.
4333	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Was looking around to see is there any way to cook some things faster and I found this Presto Pressure Cooker. I can't imagine how we (my wife and me) did all cooking before! It is soooo faster and easier with this pressure cooker. And the size is right for 2-3 people, I like fresh food and this one as I said is just right capacity for our family of 3. If you fill it at max, you even will have some food for next day, but because the whole cooking takes 15-20 minutes from very beginnings to the end it is no longer concern.

6874	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	You get what you pay for I guess. Our old fan broke and I decided to try shopping for one online. I chose this one because I didn't want to pay a lot and it was the least expensive. It works fine but it's very loud. I've never had a box fan this loud before. It's too loud on low to use it. But if you want a fan just to make noise while you sleep then this one will be great for you.

3387	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Actually it is better than a slow cooker in almost every way. Things can be steamed in this where they cannot be steamed in a slow cooker. Things can be cooked in liquid, just like a slow cooker, but in 1/16th the time. Things that "foam up" like split peas cannot be made in a pressure cooker because the foam can block the steam vents. I have not been this excited about a kitchen utensil in a decade.

587	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Most of the rope lights i have been buying lately don't come with clips or mounting hardware (screws). These do and work excellent on drywall and wood. The light is a cool white, not like daylight, but exactly as pictured which impressed me that they were able to capture the color so well in the picture. I got exactly what was described and shown on the description, came with clips/screws, and works wonderfully for "ghetto style" overhead lighting in my apartment.
And that's pretty much it as far as negatives go.  I can easily deal with all of them, and even with my hypercritical, ready-to-objectively-bash-everything attitude, I can't find any credible reason not to give this thing less than the five stars it deserves.
I went through 2 of these vacuums in less than 2 years. They start off working great every time, but die out veryquickly. The first one died in a carpeted apartment, so I attributed to working too hard on the rug.  The second burned out in out less than 7 months of working only on hardwood/tile.

This item comes in handy to smoosh lemon slices and sugar together to make lemonade, and I'm sure you'll come up with other uses too. Get one!
Overall, this is a nice 3-piece silicone spatula set. It has a nice style and a quality build.  They were constructed to be a single piece for each spatula with silicone covering the entire utensil. I tested it out on various foods and they did quite a nice job. They worked well and cleaned up pretty easily, but did need a little scrubbing for some stuck on scrambled eggs that I used the spoonula for. I love a spoonula shaped spatula for eggs because it allows for scraping with the flat edge, but also allows for scooping out of the pan.  If you are in the market for a nice set of silicone spatulas, this set performed nicely.

The so called evil red light is nice.  It always lets you know that it is definately off.  Put a small piece of tape over it if it bothers you.
These words are "passionate" yet not prurient or dirty.  I think the most explicit word is "come" which is a double entendre at worst. The other words are perfect for making poems to get your meaning across without being too blunt.
I hope this helps everyone purchasing this product.

2398	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have had this fan for over a year now. I have had no issues with it. It moves more air than your standard box window fan. I like the reversible fan feature. The casing is adjustable so it fills the whole window without any gaps. This fan has to main negatives that I do not mind but some people might. One, this fan is pretty noisy. Choose another fan if you are looking for something quiet. Two, the fan has to be screwed (or otherwise attached) to the window frame. It does not just sit on the window frame very well like other box fans do.

7118	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Very good product. Highly recommend them. Noting bad to say about them. Amazing that I can still find bags for my 1960's canister vacuum.
3563	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I really wanted to like and keep it. The price was just perfect for a stainless steel  pressure cooker. Unlike all the other reviews it didn't work for me.
It clamps down well, is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:

4289	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Performs perfectly.
2897	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I got this as a housewarming gift about two years ago and it's still going strong. The handles are affixed to the body by only one screw each, which means the handles rotate if the screws aren't really tight. The body is in great condition on the outside, but the screws are cheap and rusting and the interior is very discolored from use. I use the pressure cooker 1-3 times per week and have always washed it by hand. It's easy to clean and produces tastier results than my slow cooker, which I have only used once since receiving the pressure cooker. Definitely a keeper, but I really need to replace the screws.

3988	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	If you've never cooked with a pressure cooker you'll be surprised at the ease and convenience of using it. The food cooks quickl yand is always good.
1930	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I'm sure they are great, but I ordered the wrong bags.
The Mighty Mite may have the same size, or even a little more powerful motor than the BMC, I have no way of knowing since the BMC does not publicize the amp rating at this time, but I do know that when I am cleaning my hardwood floors or tile something that is an inch away from the floor tool is sucked into the unit before it even gets to it. I am sure some heavier, more solid items would need to have the floor tool run directly over it such as is the standard case with many vacuums.
8826	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	So far so good. it seems to be pretty durable. even though it is stainless steel I try not to put it in the dishwasher so it will last longer. The rod and handle are sturdy. Looks like I won't need another one for awhile.
If you want something that does work for lighter clean ups with out a cord this is easy to recommend.

5400	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this vacuum because it weight and many good recommendations. I was very surprised when I began to use the vacuum and it had relatively little to no suction. I am very disappointed and returning the unit. I would never recommend this vacuum.
2042	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	These are hard to find locally.  Although the description says Genuine Eureka belts, they came in generic plastic bag.  They seem to wear about as well as the original belt.  Price is great.

But if you don't need to be that scientific and need a simple pressure cooker this will satisfy your needs.
1493	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Best skin moisturizing cream ever.

3324	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I wanted and well worth the price.  Pressure cooking is not that popular in the US now days, but was when I was a kid in rural Oregon.  This is the best way to make mincemeat, cook poultry, roasts, even steaks.  I even pressure cook bacon and then drain off the excess salt and fat, then microwave it a couple minutes to make it crisp without burning. Everything cooked with this comes out tender and cooks quickly.  The energy savings alone will pay for itself in short order, and it really saves time when a person does not want to waste their life in the kitchen.

7241	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	didn't use it for the cable, just for the electrical plug-in feature. it's working just like it is supposed to. haven't had a lightning storm or any surges yet. I trust that it will work. my favorite feature is that the receptacles are coded so when you are in the tangled up web of cords, you know which one to unplug.
UPDATE Mar, 2014:  This continues to be a very useful, economical product for my hardwood floors and short fiber carpet.  One hint for using on carpet---use two hands and instead of casually flipping the sweeper about like a mop....apply a little downward pressure with your non-dominant hand and bring the unit back SLOWLY to you.  This is especially helpful when doing a casual clean up of dog hair on the bedroom medium nap carpet.  While emptying the bad is still messy it does reveal how much hair, dust and grit you've spared your floors and carpet from.  4.5 STARS.
6054	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Had it for a while and it seems to work very well.  I have a Persian cat and boy does he shed, this picks it up nicely, only thing is its small, so if you have a large area to vacuum you may want bigger Eureka, but I live in apartment so works great for me
1407	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Nice way to store 12 AAA batteries in a case designed to hold only AAA batteries. The case is divided in the middle and fits six batteries on each side, three up and three down. Most of the other plastic battery cases hold four or eight AA batteries and says "fits AA or AAA batteries," but they don't let you put, say, six AAA batteries in the case meant for four AA.

Update - NO response from Lasko on email I sent just after this- stay away!
622	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I really like having the remote control function. I'm disabled and it's extremely helpful to be able to adjust the settings or turn the heater on or off.  The only shortcoming is with the thermostat controls.  They don't perform as well as I had hoped and the temperature displayed isn't real accurate to the air temperature of the room.  Fortunately, with the remote, you can manually control the amount of heat being provided.  It puts out a lot of heat and has a very quiet fan with 2 speeds.
1204	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Underpowered.  This thing just does not perform.  And now, after about a year of use, the cutting assembly is cracked.  Replacement, with shipping, is about 1/3 the cost of a new blender.  Here's more junk for the land fill!

2654	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Excellent pressure cooker as usual from Presto.  I already had the 23 quart version that I've been using for years for putting canned goods up.  Don't know why I waited so long to get the 8 quart.  We live at 7500 feet and I have had batches of dry beans that will not soften no matter how long you soak and cook them.  The first thing I made with this pressure cooker was a batch of elk chili with dried kidney beans and it came out perfect!  Only thing I didn't like was the texture of the meat.  Came out more like fibrous stew meat than chunky chili meat.  Next time, I'll cook the meat separately and add it in after the pressure cooking.  I love to cook and this pressure cooker will make my life so much easier at altitude.

Cats have nice new box to play with and I have great smooth operating and quiet cooling Lasko 20" box fan just the right size for my apartment. If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder. This fan delivers the goods,goods in this case being circulating cool air. Appreciate the prompt delivery also. You may wonder why the early review since having the fan only a couple hours,well the reason is I trust Lasko for a good product since my previous fan was a Lasko I have used for the last 10 years! Motor just wore out after good work for 10 years. Thanks Lasko!
6631	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I searched for these and in my area they were hard to find in the store. I haven't used them yet as the old one isn't broke, just yet. But I felt like having them in the house before it actually broke. I'm sure they will work just fine

8815	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I've always found the "Pie Server" utensil useless, especially if you don't have room for kitchen cabinets to store all the utensils.  You can get by just by using a fork and a regular butter knife or a turner, a flipper or spatula.

It has made a difference with the quality of the water.

The attachments that come with it are user-friendly -a crevice tool & a two-in one dusting brush / upholstry brush combo. I did purchase the better quality dusting brush as an acccessory. And, my Dyson power-head for fur removal from upholstry fits the wands perfectly. (Not so lucky with the Bosch I just gave away)
1194	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Cuisinart, I thought, built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this "blender" but I am not one of them.
4713	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Got this for under the bed and furniture plus behind the fridge and it does a good job. Not super powerful but enough for hard wood floors. Carpet might be another matter with the suction. The hose length is excellent and swivels easily.
7523	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have plenty of room on my fridge for storage. But not very much in cupboards and drawers. So some genius came up with the idea of sticking magnets on these babies, and they haven't gotten lost in our house since. I wish my walls were magnetic and more products could just be stuck on there for storage. Alright, that would look terrible, but these things are a great idea and they even look kind of nice and colorful decorating the fridge when they're not holding bags of chips closed.
7434	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	It is not sharp, and requires much too much pressure on the lemon skin to get the zest.  My friend had one of the same brand and hers worked really well. Not sure why mine didn't function the same way.

5534	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This vacuum has been great. Its a compact size with a lot of power. Out house is small and not a lot of storage space. The wand is nice and long and does an awesome job on bare floors and area rugs. This product is not ment for carpeting at all is the main drawback. I noticed that where you grip the wand there is a window that you can open to reduce suction; this works its way open as your vacuuming. Other than those two things I am completely satisfied. In fact my mom liked mine so much she got one too. The replacement bags are inexpensive and for the price and performance of this product it is a good buy.

5903	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This vacuum has power! I have to lower the suction on it so I could get anywhere. It works pretty well on carpeted areas. The length of the stick would be ideal for taller people, it feels a little awkward for me since I am 5'3, but it's not something I can't get used to. It came with 2 OEM vacuum bags and a separate brush attachment. I wish the cord was retractable like my old one, but it didn't deter me from buying this.
My house has hardwood, wall to wall and area rugs and it does a great job on all of them (no cats or dogs so I can't comment on that).  Also, great for the car or anything else.  The bag changes easily without any mess.  I read people commenting negatively on the hose crimping.  That is not true on mine.  Perhaps, they have changed the design on the newer units.  I rate it a very good no frills machine.
I've had mine for over 3 years and use it mostly in the winter months...I've probably made 20 roasts in the unit.
I highly recommend this can opener, ditch your electric can opener and make things easier on yourself!

2526	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	SO HERE IS MY SITUATION. THE fan arrived with the on off speed knob not on the shaft.  It will not go on.  The shaft is cheap plastic so the knob won't stay on.  I bought it from thenerds dot net and they want me to pay return shipping which would cost from $[...]to $[...] depending who ships it because of the large box.  I am waiting to hear from them before I dispute the bill with the credit card company and file with the attorney General for fraud.  Lesson learned is buy from AMAZON!!! At least they have a return policy you can live with.  I know better now.  The fan is too noisy on high speed.  i have had the fan on for 2 hours.  it is about 60 outside and yet the room has gone down from 80 to 78 in 2 hours.  When I stand a foot away from the fan the room is as hot as it was before I had the fan on.  When I stand in front of the fan it is cool.  Maybe it is sucking air in the room but it is not helping cool the room.  On top of the crappy performance I have to deal with the low quality of a broken knob and also a rather worthless template to install the brackets.  I should have listened to my gut feeling and bought a $[...] box fan and made a bracket to hold it in the window frame so i could easily remove it.  Right now I will need to take this 16 poudn fan off the bracket screws to close the window.  so with shipping the nerds dot com ripped me blind.  I am glad I didn't pay more for it but I might be stuck with it.  I wrote to Lasko about this and will see if they can replace it for me or get me a new shaft or knob.  MY ADVICE DO NOT BUY THIS FAN.  CHEAP JUNK.  I DON'T CARE IF 8 people liked it here- this is cheap junk

7604	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great bar tool.  We saw a flair bartender on Celebrity Cruises use this to make orange, lime and lemon rind peels for martinis.  He showed us how and it is so easy and makes our martinis at home cocktail hours and dinner parties look professional.  We have not used this to make zest but the channel knife works so well with fresh citrus fruit skins.  It is just the right balance of sharpness so I have never cut myself but I can make beautiful curly twists of oranges, lemons and limes effortlessly.  The grip is great because even if you hands are wet the large rubber handle is stable.  It cleans up easily too with some warm water and Dawn.  We have been using ours for more than 6 months and the stainless steel head and black rubber grip look like new.  We highly recommend.  Kudos again to Oxo for another amazing tool.

Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers and an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use.

To remove zest from citrus, simply pull the sharp edge of the zester across the fruit peel. The zester has fine holes which are sharp and cut into the peel. This results in fine strips of citrus peel which may then be chopped. If you want to obtain small pieces without having to chop the zest, just pull the sharp edge across a small section at a time. I recommend using organic citrus fruits.

We made 4 sets of racks each with 16 foot length boards for the bottoms and one bracket each end of the board and one half way for the mid support upright board.  They will certainly be easy to move around when the wood is used up so we can clean under them and I really like how the wood is not on the ground. One reviewer wrote that the pieces were a little larger than the lumber causing them to shim the wood but we didn't have this situation and infact we needed to slightly shave one piece of wood to get it to fit.  Otherwise, the wood fit nicely.  I would say this metal is perfectly heavy duty for this project and appears to be well coated for the elements.

2451	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Years ago in a townhouse I had a whole house fan.  I'd open all the windows a couple of inches in the evening, turn the fan on and feel the air move upstairs and be pulled out of the house by the fan. This fan is advertised as a reversible window fan and I purchased it for a 450 square foot upstairs room.  I put it in one window and on the opposite side of the room, about 23 feet away, I open the other window fully.  On an evening where there is no incoming breeze, with this set up as described above and the fan on high, I can stand 8 feet away from the open window and when it is on high, reverse speed, I can very obviously feel the air being pulled in through the open window outside. If I feel it at that point, I know it's circulating the room air and eventually pulling the warm air out. I recommend using it in this manner; if you just set it on reverse and don't open another nearby window sufficiently to pull in cool air, you might not think this is working.  In a sense, it works like a whole house fan.  Is it one? - no, it's not going to pull cool air in through your entire house unless it's a very small house.

They are hanging on hooks on my kitchen wall to keep them near at hand, and save on storage space. I started out with one, then realized I wanted a second one because I sometimes prepare Indian dahl and basmati rice. Both the rice and the lentils are washed several times and then soaked before cooking, but usually cooked separately. I like to wash and soak them in the strainers in bowls of water. The strainers are a perfect size for this task. Each one can fit down really well in its own large mixing bowl. After soaking, I can just lift them out, drain, and I'm ready to cook. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's great because they are long enough to suspend right over a standard size sink from one side to the other. Handy for draining things.

4440	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker, purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap, it not only does not do the job, the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it.

Recommended from me, but please take other reviews into consideration.
I've been using this vacuum for well over a month now and I couldn't be more impressed.  I've changed the star rating to a five because this thing performs so well.  I have changed the plastic tubing with my metal telescoping and I use a better dusting brush, but everything else I have left the same.  I just can't sing enough praises.  All of the sand disapears out of the grout and it actually sucks down to the floor and carpeting.  I used my upright on the one carpeted room with a new bag and a new belt on the brush.  Then I put a new bag in the Mighty Mite and vacuumed again.  I was shocked at the amount of dirt that the Might Mite picked up that was left behind with the upright (the upright is a commercial Eureka).  I'm sold.  Buy it you won't be sorry.

6102	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I have a laundry room in the center of the house and as anyone knows doing laundry creates dust! I decided to keep a straight suction smaller BAGGED (hate bagless) vacuum like this in the laundry room and it fits perfectly where I need it to because of its shape. It takes months for the bag to fill up and it doesn't seem to lose much suction at all or smell because I'm only really using it for clean dryer lint and to vacuum all around the laundry room when I'm finished doing laundry. Bag's aren't that expensive and are super easy to change....Nothing on this vacuum has failed as of yet, however, the switch to turn it off/on is on top and I've noticed recently that you have to push the switch a few times to turn it off/on before in works. I'm thinking the switch is going bad........But I paid 60 dollars for this 8 years ago and I have used it a lot here and there. If anyone has any recommendations about the switch, let me know. I'm not handy with things like that though unfortunately.

2320	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	The fan doesn't fit into a normal energy star approved window in a new home without major modifications. It comes with screws that would suggest the manufacturer wants you to screw it into your window frame (if it fits). We were not about to ruin our window (and you cannot close the window if you screw in the fan. Making a cheap plastic fan a permanent part of your window is probably not the intention of most buyers. The plastic wings that pull out to accommodate different sized windows has a circle cut-out that allows air from outside to come in... as well as bugs and rain. This is a very confusing design. Why would you want a hole in your fan? We attempted to use it twice despite it's ill-fit, but it's motor was too powerful and blasted it out onto the tile floor below. The second time it happened, it broke. Waste of money.

6153	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great, but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So, from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said, i can always slap a piece of tape on that part, because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price.
The upside is the air flow.  This fan, unlike the other brand I had, moves air very well.  The highest setting on the other brand didn't move as much air as the lowest setting on this Lasko.  In a small space, the lowest and "quietest" setting will do the job.  In a larger space, the medium and high speeds will move air nicely but the noise can be distracting.

Rubbermaid fails to note the INTERNAL dimensions of the product (i.e., where the actual storage occurs).  The tricky part is that the inside of the tote has a few nooks, which may (or may not) be useful depending on your needs.  So, at the narrowest points the dimensions are 15.3 x 11.5 x 10 inches.  As the tote tapers out, that 11.5 width expands to nearly 14 inches.

I took the advice of another reviewer and put these in a pot of boiling water for a couple of minutes.  I removed them with tongs and immediately put the seals on the container with no problem at all.  I left them on until they cooled.  Now the lids go on and off just the way you would want them too.  You don't want it to be too easy because then it will not be a tight enough seal.  Maybe it is a little tricky for young children as another reviewer pointed out, but for me it is relatively easy to seal them.  They are perfect for carrying a liquid ingredient without worrying about a leak.

Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs, now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house. I mean everything. Lol. It goes from hardwood to carpet easily, the bags last a long time. There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion. 1) the cord does not retract, and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks. It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace.

They're both great! I vacuumed as soon as I unpacked and assembled the Mighty Mite, and I was done in no time. There was no moving furniture, this goes under and behind everything so easily.

After filling with a hot liquid the cap fits rather loosely in place. But, after a few seconds heat expands it and it wedges itself in place very securely. You can still pry it off but not easily when it's hot which is just what you'd want. Also, that cap has a neat little sliding anti-splash tab on the top that actually works.

I wish Presto would make one smaller than 4 quarts (3 quarts). I have been looking for one but could find one that I like.
1196	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this to replace an older model and thought I was getting a similar item but this is much more lightweight.  So - not a replacement but I'll still review it objectively.  It is inexpensive so it's components reflect the price point: lighter and flimsier.  The base is not heavy and feels somewhat unstable.  The bowl is difficult to line up and click into place, the blades's anchor is light cheap plastic and if I let it run for even an extremely short amount of time (say, to chop a few nuts) it starts overheating and a burning smell ensues.  I would say that it's only use would be for extremely light chopping jobs or perhaps making mayonaise or salad dressings. That's not enough utility for me,  so I will replace with a more expensive model that I hope will last like my original 20+year-old one which I've bequeathed to my son.

So many great meals she prepared with it. I came to the US in 1965 and had to left them in Havana until 1970 when she and my father finally came to joint me here in the US.  After a few days of them here we went to buy  cooking utensils and kitchenware for our new home here in Miami.  I purchased for her a Presto 6 quart and 4 quart cooker.  Do not have to say she was delighted.  She used them like in Cuba, almost every day for many, many delicious meals, until she was very old (92 years old) and passed away in 1995.  I still have these Prestos and they are like new.  I just have ordered the gaskets and pressure valve through the Presto site here in the Web.  Just to say I cook a lot myself and used them very often.  Presto stands back on all their models and have replacement parts for all their cookers old and new.  They even have the originals Manuals with recipes and user instructions and times for every model the have ever produced.  I should say these cookers would last for generations if well treated and cleaned. They are part of the dear memories I have of my family.

Well, because it's easy to use, it's easy to clean, it's stainless steel, it's easy to assemble, it's easy to maintain, and you can find the replacement parts.  The "back to basics" is simply a way to remind people that Americans made good use of pressure cookers in the past as a way to make healthy meals fast. If you want to save some energy, this pot works very well on induction cooktops!  When the power goes out and you have access to another suitable source of heat for cooking and clean water, you can prepare a safe meal (possibly using even less energy...) for you and your loved ones every day until the power is restored.
Fun tip: Spray your pizza cutter with a bit of olive oil before slicing for easy clean-up.
I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away. However, it's big and bulky.

Other tea bags don't hold the heat like these do, so I regularly burn my fingers slightly when I pluck them out of the tea.  I noticed it when I had two different types of bags in one tea pot.  Both bags had their edges over the side while the tea steeped. When I used my fingers to pull them out, the glue-sealed one didn't feel hot at all; the t-sac was super hot.  But that is not even close to being enough to stop me buying these very convenient tea bags.

It doesn't work so great on the rugs...it picks up surface dirt, but nothing really deep down.  No big deal, though.  Its small, light weight, and has some good suction power.  I'm happy with it.  I hope it lasts a couple years.
5438	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This is simply a weak vacuum. The long handle is great, but the longer I make the extension the weaker the suction is. I was using it for a couple of weeks, and then bought the $79.00 bissell as a replacement. First I vacuumed with the Eureka, and immediately after with the bissell 9595A. It is shocking how much more the bissell picked up that the pet eureka missed.  I would not buy this under any circumstances.
6572	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I bought this vacuum to help cleanup our kitchen floor, which is always dirty from the dog (and us) tracking dirt in. It does a pretty good job, quickly sucking up loose dirt, dog hair, etc.  My only complaint is that it has a hard time picking up small rocks (2-3mm).
7310	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This is a Butter Spreader but I bought it mainly to use for a peanut butter spreader, to spread p-nut butter on rice cakes. It's nice but the serrated edge is "sharp", so one needs to be careful when using or handling. Just wish the serrated edge wasn't so sharp.
The handles are on both sides and give it a nicer look (in my opinion) than the ones with the fabric handles. The bins hold a lot of my daughter's fake play food, doll clothes, you name it. They're very roomy and the best part is that I can't see the mess. I can't understand how people can complain about the fabric in this product as being cheap. What do they expect for a bin that costs $4.20 each?  You can't even buy materials to make your own bin for that price.
After 4 years I still have three of the 4 clips.  Only one has broken and since they stick to the fridge I have not even lost one of the clips.  This to me is impressive!

I have several OXO utensils and 2 have broken in the last few days. the head snapped of my OXO bottle brush last night at the flex point above the steel handle where it is plastic. I was just shaking the water out of it after using before placing in dish drainer to dry. Head came flying off. The OXO utensils are nicely designed and great while they last but that is not long. I also have 2 wooden silicone spatulas, the wood handles are fine but silicone head is nicked and disintigrating. I hand wash all of my utensils and do not abuse them.

6197	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	I badly needed to replace a bagless canister vacuum that was driving me NUTS!  I hated emptying the bin and cleaning out the filters, which were always clogged.  And the concentrated dust and debris that escape during emptying - I shudder to think how much of that dust I've breathed in.  Being a bit light in the pocket, I was pleased to find this Eureka model oh so reasonably priced.  My first impression when unpacking from the box was dismay at how thin and cheap the tubes and attachments felt.  They seem durable however and really, lighter is better.  This unit is very easy to pull around and the suction is good.  I have hardwood floors but I was hoping I could use it to clean my area rugs and the indoor/outdoor carpeting in my rec room.  It works GREAT on the indoor/outdoor carpeting and pretty good on the area rugs.  The thick pile area living room rug...well, it's just sweeping/brushing the top really, so an upright will be needed there.  I don't mind that the cord doesn't retract - I always attach an extension cord anyway.  The long slender attachment fits in the top handle, so that is handy.  It is a bit louder than I would like but overall I am very pleased with the purchase and feel I definitely got my money's worth.

This model still has good suction and is lightweight/maneuverable.  As several reviewers have noted, the hose is lightweight and can kink easily but my second Mighty Mite was like that so I was used to that.
My only complaint, as will ALL fans that I've owned, are that they get dusty rather quickly and are difficult to clean.  You have to unscrew the plastic screens, wipe the fan blade, hose down the screens, and screw them pack on.

It's not the Rolls Royce of fans. It's a good fan at a great price. You can pay 3x what this one usually costs ($50 to $80) for only marginal improvements in performance.

I've had ot over a year now and have had no problems.  I have four dogs, a cat, a macaw parrot and 2 cockatiels and this vac is fantastics when it comes to all the messes I have to deal with.  The bags don't fill near as quickly as I thought they would and can hold quite a bit of pet hair, dog toy stuffing guts, feathers and bird seed.  As other reviews have reported, the hoses are a little on the cheap side and kink somewhat easily, but with a quick twist they are back to normal.  Has outstanding suction and is easy to maneuver around the house and light enough to carry up the stairs.  Great price and value.

The good: the coffee made by the machine is wonderful, IF you have the common sense to adjust the amount of beans you use in accordance with how strong you like your coffee. The people who complain that the coffee is "weak" need to put on their proverbial thinking caps and simply ADD MORE BEANS! Yup, once you get the right ratio of beans to water the coffee is plenty strong, and since it's freshly ground, the flavor is terrific. The automatic brewing features are reasonably easy to set and use, and these make it possible to wake up in the morning to freshly brewed coffee, a terrific start to any day. Complaints about how hard it is to clean the machine are also kind of silly; have we gotten so spoiled as a culture that we can't stand to routinely remove and rinse out the necessary parts of a kitchen appliance after every use? Cleaning the removable parts takes a couple of minutes, true, but it's definitely not such an odious task that it should discourage potential purchasers.

UPDATE:  Presto has decided to give me a "one time courtesy replacement" .  They have no reason why this is not a straight Warranty replacement.  However, they want me to sped another 1/3rd of the cost of a new one to ship the lid back.  Apparently this is to ensure I cannot use the old one again.  So they are more worried about their possible loss than my having a product that is not defective.  They don't want the actual pot that warped back, so they could examine it themselves.  If they did, they could pay the return freight.  The customer should not have to be punished because their product is defective, which is what return freight charges are.  It is good money after bad, like an internet scam of some obscure lottery win, where you send a fee for "processing".  Not buying it.

I like the fact that this Presto model is stainless steel rather than aluminum.  However, since aluminum is a better conductor of heat, this Presto model has a bi-metal base with a disc of aluminum welded to the outside bottom of the pan.  This pressure cooker set includes a special insert rack that allows you to cook multiple foods at once without their flavors intermingling.  (This, of course, only works if the various foods are not suspended in the same liquid together.)

I hand wash it as I find that easy, after use just add a bit of water and drop of DW liquid put the lid back on and blend to clean then rinse.
These are cheap box fans, and I found them to be quite serviceable. They could certainly be quieter, and move more air, but for $20, they work great. If you are looking for the absolute highest volume of air, or quietest fan, you can certainly get it by spending more money.

Though the cheap wand is the most disappointing feature of the vacuum, the wheels are another weak point.  They are plastic and "pop" into body.  When in use, the vacuum does not so much follow you as most canister vacuums but seems more to drag behind.  They have not held up and I have already had to repair the same one twice now.  Additionally, the hose is very thin, cheap and easily creased.

6789	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I checked out youtube and other websites to see which beverage cooler would suit my needs.  One guy conducted a temperature test and the rubbermaid version won out on that experiment, but by only a few degrees.  The reason I decided to purchase this unit is because the lid doesn't screw on, which in my opinion could be problematic down the road.  I have some small 1 gallon beverage coolers that I have to fight with sometimes to unscrew so I didn't want to deal with that situation.  I like the simple push on and pull off lid. I have this sitting in the bed of my truck, and the handle is in the upright position to keep and secure the lid in place. I mainly purchased this to have fresh water available to drink anytime I need it and the 3 gallon size is more than adequate and the 5 gallon size is a little overkill for my needs and more difficult to lift into my truck full.  This one cost a little more, but its suppose to be heavy duty and should last a bit longer than some others.

One thing he doesn't pay much attention to is the letters, and his fascination with letters on anything else is kind of why I chose this placemat!

3185	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	OK, this may be premature. I just got my Presto 4-Qt pressure cooker today. I washed it, dried it, then immediately put it to the test. I had some posole corn grains to cook (which had been soaked overnight already). Following the booklet's instructions, I added enough water to cover the posole by an inch. Put the lid on securely (having checked the pressure vents and seal all around), then placed it on the burner on high heat. After about 10 min, steam started to GUSH from the handle area, top (under the rocker) and even the sides a bit. Twenty minutes later, even MORE steam. The inset pressure valve had long since raised up and locked into place. So what gives? That rocker simply NEVER EVER started to jiggle. I stopped. Let the pressure cooker cool, removed lid, re-checked the insides and all valves, then fired it up again. Same story. FORTY minutes of steam gushing from the sides and near handles later (and rocker still as a corpse), I stopped. Cooled it down. Did the whole thing a THIRD time. Again, 20 min later, NO rocking motion whatsoever coming from the top. It appears that all pressure valves are doing what they should. The handles fit together nicely, and the lid is definitely locked in place (assuming the gasket is also where it should be). Complete puzzle. Very frustrating. I suppose I'll have to return it, but even as I peck out this review, I *know* I am going to try this ONE more time. My mom has a Miromatic pressure cooker about 25 yrs old that this Presto was supposed to replace. Uh, NOT.

8087	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We recently ordered and received another batch of these high-performance clips from Oxo.  We already had a set from years back.  I came to write a review and started scanning reviews and was startled at how many less-than-fair star ratings are accumulating and read them.  Well, almost all are of the nature of "you can buy binder clips for less" and one is from a consumer who was unhappy that the clips would not support kitchen TOWELS, another unhappy because they roll their snack bags and the clips couldn't accommodate the "girth" of the roll, if you will. DON'T be concerned about purchasing these clips, just look forward to receiving them.. they would make a nice small gift or a great little addition to a gift basket, we've had the first set for more than four years and they still look NEW, their grip is still secure, they brighten up the kitchen, they are easy to use, I've never had to clean them except for occasional "wipe-off", we already have our second set purchased very recently and they are just as outstanding as the old ones, let me put it this way:  The OLD ones are EQUAL to the NEW ones in EVERY way...how many times can you say that about an additional purchase of a favored item?? Buy without remorse, concern or guilt.  Especially if you prefer kitchen items that cheer up you and your kitchen rather than binder clips (which I despise unless forced to use binder clips for an inch or more of paper, I've been "snapped" by them countless times and furthermore they're not intended for kitchen use where moisture could occur (i.e., rust), also small children can't handle binder clips easily and the smaller ones could pose a problem..esp. for toddlers. I'm not for binder clips in the kitchen).  If there were a higher rating than five-stars I would give the highest rating possible to this product.  I just don't like to see product ratings that are low due to unrelated issues of the product.

It is lightweight and powerful, easy to use and store, and had a great price! I used these in my cleaning business for years and found them to be better than my st lightweight vacuums.

These are not silicone all the way through but rather reinforced by what the manufacturer says is steel, with seams along the edges, presumably where the mold was opened.  Both the smallest spatula and one of the larger ones have both a curved side and a straight side -- one for scraping bowls and the other for spreading or getting stuff out of rectangular containers.  The other larger one is more of a spoon and is great for stirring and folding.

This machine really has impressive suction, too much at times-- which is why you can adjust the intake flow. You hold the light canister in 1 hand, & take it where you need to go. The cord is plenty long, and the unit, being small, stores very neatly. This thing is just plain well-done.

9656	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	love it. opens a can with little effort.
It is common that people prefer to have an upright with such capabilities as well as a canister that can get into places and upright cant even dream of accessing; like tight spaces, doing your blinds, getting the cobwebs up on the ceiling, although some uprights do have the add on tube vacuum option.

Also, more electronics, though look really high tech with digital led lights and all, they tend to possibly short out after a certain period of time. So, in  essence, this thing is tech proof, and waterproof!  Make sure you get the stainless steel though, there is one that Presto Makes out of Aluminum, and I don't recommend it.  Since the food is being cooked under intense pressure, no sense in skimping on the the cost for the sake fo your safety.
8030	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These work really nicely for clamping bags of chips shut tightly. The magnets are convenient as these clamps stick right on the chalkboard door of my pantry. The tips that actually grip the bag are rubber coated. It's higher quality than it needs to be but I find that satisfying and typical of OXO products.

Lasko's are mass produced, American-made fans retailed widely at many outlets, at least in the USA.. usually larger chains.. during warm seasons. They normally retail for $15-20 and represent excellent value at that price. If you order by mail and have to pay shipping, much value is lost. (this particular offering sells 3 units so the shipping is shared to bring the per-fan cost to around $25 each.. assuming of course you can use 3 fans)

2421	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues, but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy, but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws, so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you, put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable, but it exhausts air much better than it draws air, and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed, which is how we run it anyway.

Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit, finish, and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating.
9309	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We had two pizza cutters that were both over 5 years old, that this replaced. We typically eat at least 1 pizza a week in our household, so it gets a fair amount of use. The one cutter we had was about an inch smaller diameter wheel and required a lot more effort to cut through pizza (this is about 4"). The other had some special coating on it that had worn off over the years and parts around the center bolt had begin to show rust (yuck!). They had both had obviously become dull over the years slowly, and I guess you just become accustom to having to make 4+ rolls over a line to get a complete through cut. Immediately was blown away when I started using this, as it was cut through in a single pass! Sometimes I have to make a double pass, it depends what kind of crust and how it was cooked. Additionally, besides the need for multiple passes, it requires much less downward pressure to achieve the perfect cut. I will probably replace my pizza cutters every few years now, and will reconsider this one next time.
 Now I know it's not the exact same vacuum but it's the same brand and same model line.

I couldn't break one in half with my hands, but my boys had no trouble chewing them.  Which is kind of a bummer because I was hoping they kept them busy longer.  Although, they don't really need to clean their teeth because they are on a raw diet and the chicken drumsticks they get keep their teeth clean, clean, clean!

I cook more because this speeds up cooking time (especially at my high altitude), and everything tastes so much better.

6199	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	4.0	While this vacuum is not without its flaws, for the money it is a "best buy".  I finally got frustrated with the Royal I purchased a few years ago and replaced it with this Eureka for less than half what I spent on the Royal.  I read the reviews from other owners and pretty much knew the pros and cons.  I have multiple pets and hardwood floors with area rugs in each room.  The suction is impressive and the bag size is much larger than you would anticipate for such a small unit.  It has one of the longest cords I have ever seen on a vacuum, which is good and bad news.  I agree with other reviewers that the hose is really cheap and will need replacing during the life of the unit.  It would really have been nice for the power cord to be retractable.  If Eureka had a model which solves these two complaints I would have paid an extra $50.00 for the unit.  As it is, a am very pleased with the performance and supplied accessories.  Surprisingly good on the rugs.  Watch out for an unmentioned slide on the hose attachment which siphons off suction when you want less power.  I taped it since it was so easy to open accidentally.  Over all, a good performer considering the price.  Also, I ordered direct from Amazon and it arrived in just 3 days!  Another typical 5 star performance from the Amazon warehouse.

As powerful as the suction is, it is a pretty quiet machine; you can hear bits of debris bouncing up the metal extension rod; with my Bissell, you can't even hear yourself think. The telescoping extension rod is great for ergonomic adjustments, and to get to those out of reach areas with the crevice tool. Storing the cord on the bottom seemed awkward, but you just flip the canister up on its back wheels and wrap the cord around the hooks. If you don't want to (or can't) bend over long enough to do that, the canister is light enough to pick up and hold under one arm while you wrap the cord.  Nice, long, heavy duty cord too, by the way.
Amazon says nothing about cooking on a glass top, instruction Book says not to use on glass top stoves because the bottom has a concave in the middle that won't allow it to get up to pressure, Well I have a glass top and not wanting to send it back I tried it, came to a boil faster than a old (20 or more years)I own, Put the lid on and it locked fairly quick, maybe 5 minutes? steam started coming out of the top, I waited about 2 minutes and put the weight on, maybe 6 to 8 minutes it was bounceing like it should, so much for not coming up to pressure on a glass top stove.

6683	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	These brackets make an easy start to creating a log rack. They're wide enough to accept treated lumber, which tends to be a bit larger than standard dimensional lumber. I suspect untreated 2x4s will be a bit loose, but not so much that they won't be held firmly. Obviously, an outdoor device demands treated lumber in most climates, but indoor structures such as a workbench don't need it. The best part about this is that the long horizontal members assemble on edge rather than flat - that is, with the 3.5" side vertical and the 1.5" side horizontal, which is much better for carrying loads. The plastic alternative to these brackets apparently (from reading the reviews) does this wrong.

Very pleased with this product!...Just wanted to add a note.. I never run water over the pan to cool it down...as it is still cooking.. I know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally, so I time it based on experience. When you let it cool on it's own, that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization. Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong.  I just shut the fire down about 10min less to incorporate cool down... Any longer would be overdone...

It gets into corners and is maneuverable under low furniture. It's almost ridiculously light in weight, and the cord is decently long.

I was so impressed with it, as soon as I have the money I will buy one for myself and retire my other one which has to be at least 40 years old. It still works great! But the new one has some great features and a more modern look. I think the Presto brand is very dependable, never had any problems with it, I've used a different brand before that blew up spewing chicken soup all over my kitchen. If you are looking for a SAFE, dependable pressure cooker than the Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker is the one to get.

I no longer use this machine.  It still works but the grinder motor was starting to die.  My daughter gave me a Starbucks Barista Aroma for Christmas (best coffee ever) and I bought a Burr Grinder.  Would not wholeheartedly recommend this machine.  Too expensive and doesn't live up to the hype.

4396	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	We have used Pressure Cookers (PC) for more than 40 years.  Out current one (Maitres 6 qt aluminum) was made in 1989 and reliable parts are no longer economically available. The cost of a new Presto 6qt aluminum PC is $30 while the cost of parts for the Maitres was $15-20. We chose to get the Presto.  The lid is easy to attach. We had bought a Presto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, but the lid is too difficult for the lady of the house to attach, so she wouldn't use it.  The Presto 6-Quart Aluminum Pressure Cooker is so simple to use that she has no problems.  It's taller than the Maitres 6 qt aluminum and not as wide. Assembly of the handles is simple and needs a Phillis #2 screw driver.  Check the screw tightness after several uses, as metal expansion-contraction cycles will tend to loosen them initially. Good product.
As I said earlier, this vacuum is being given to a college student/athlete, so it probably won't get used as frequently as it should; and when it is used, I'm sure it won't be treated kindly. If it lasts 6 months, (whether or not it's used as a vacuum) I'll update my rating to 5-stars!

4923	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I wanted a lightweight, cordless vac for in-between vacuumings and for stairs. After looking at the reviews, I selected this one and am glad I did. It works great on wood and lineoleum floors, is easy to empty, and gets up enough of the lint etc. from carpets that I don't have to drag out the big, heavy vacuum cleaner nearly as often. The battery stays charged long enough to do two sets of carpeted stairs, kitchen and dining room floors, a once-over on living room and two bedroom carpets, and four or five throw rugs. Then if I need more time (I -never- need more time for vacumming) I can very easily swap in the extra battery. It's easy to empty (it's essentially a Dustbuster on a stick). It won't replace a big vacuum cleaner -- doesn't deep-clean the carpets -- but if you don't like vacuuming, this little tool lets you do the big jobs less often, which to me is a godsend.

If you are going to buy only one, get the microplane because it also works for grating hard cheese, and whatever this Oxo zester does can be done with a paring knife. (More fun and a lot faster to use the zester, though.)

6108	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	Apparently you can't trust Eureka/Electrolux not to hide behind special brand terminology & marketing tricks. The HEPA filter on this vacuum is basically useless, as other reviewers have stated, because the vacuum's exhaust isn't entirely forced through the filter....there are other exhaust vents that aren't filtered, and thus their claim of filtering 99.7% of all particles is a lie. It only filters 99.7% of the particles that happen to get blown through the filter......100% of the rest of the particles get blown through the other unfiltered vents. Ridiculous!

Being an empty nest'r I felt a smaller cooker would better fit my needs and use less energy.

Pressure cooking is the best way to prepare all-in-one meals using a lot less energy and often in less than half the time.. A win win in my opinion.

It always feels odd to rate minor kitchen implements as 5 stars, but this OXO meat tenderizer definitely works the way it should. The spiky end pokes holes in the meat nicely and the flat end flattens out thick chicken breasts in no time flat. It's fun to use (or at least I think so!) and it doesn't require a huge amount of strength. The grip is comfortable and doesn't lend itself to flying out of your hands. It's easy to clean - meat doesn't cling to the spiky end - and while it probably isn't rated for dishwasher use, that never stops me from throwing it in anyway, and I've had no problems.

5174	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	This is probably the worst product I have bought in years.  Not only does it not have much suction but the batteries and I bought extra ones only last about 2 minutes.  If I had not already used it and thrown away the packaging a mistake I won't make in the future, I would return it.  Don't waste your money.  I am very disappointed as I have used other Eureka cordless vacs in the past and actually have a hand help that is wonderful which is what I now use instead of this one.
6190	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	2.0	Do not buy this product thinking it is capable of picking up pet hair, like I did.  Buy the yellow version online at Walmart for $60 . . . This was a huge disappointment - the pet paw brush jammed in the first five minutes.  After 45 mins of fiddling with a knife and screw driver, I got it working again.  Another ten minutes of cathair and it was hopelessly jammed again.  Customer Service sent out a new one.  Same thing.  In short, this vacuum is simply not capable of doing what it is marketed for - cleaning up pet hair.  Don't expect it to do this -- it won't.  It's a poor design.  I have seriously considered returning it.  As a general small vacuum it is marginally ok.  The air hole on the tube where you hold it (designed to lessen suction when moving from bare floor to rugs) will drive you crazy - it opens all the time on its own and you find yourself vacuuming with half suction.  This is a poorly designed product and does not do what I bought it for -- cleaning up pet hair from three long hair cats.  The Walmart yellow model can be outfitted with the HEPA filter if that is desired.  Don't waste the extra money for this "pet owners model"  - the pet paw attachment is JUNK.

623	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Heats the room very good, I use it in my living room and it heats quickly but doesn't dry like other heaters. I love how you can choose to skin it and that it shows the temp in the room while heating it

Many have complained of the noise with this model. I find that while it is "noisy" most all vacuum cleaners are. Also this vacuum works great if you want to give your car a quick vacuum.
2A)  Dispose of the HEPA Filter and forget about it (unless your need of a HEPA vacuum is certain).  Keeping a clean bag and motor filter in the vacuum will satisfy most home owners as far as dust filtration goes).

Right out of the shipping box 2 of the 4 reasons why it's better were apparent; the cutting wheel is huge and it's got some heft to it. Then I remove it from the packaging (held by 2 zip-ties and not just twist-wraps so you'll need a proper cutter) and reason number 3 is the handle and how it's thicker than the typical cutter and feels solid. Finally, the 4th is when I actually used it, there was absolutely no wobble in the cutter wheel and it cut in perfectly straight line (on closer inspection of the bolt that hold the cutter wheel, there's a plastic washer on both sides of the wheel that makes sure the wheel stays firmly in place and cuts true).
It is more expensive than some of the cheap ones you can get at dollar stores or big grocery chains but worth the money.
My companion loves salads but detests cutting up vegetables -- otherwise she is a superb home cook, with a very pronounced French accent.
Two things I don't like about it.
Over the years, I'd say they average 2-5 yrs of fairly regular use at least half the year (many thousands of hours) One that broke when one of my kids poked something in the blades, I used an old blade and the fan snapped right on in place of the broken one It served many more hours.

This vacuum does it all and then some!  An added bonus is that all of the Oreck tools fit on this hose.  Some of the Oreck tools are better, like the extension wand & floor attachment.  But the bigger bag & not having to sling it over my shoulder make the Mighty Mite much easier to use.

7091	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I got this and decided to make 6 quarts of Cookies and Cream Ice Cream as my first try. I did not realize that I would need more ice than I had originally bought. I want to say that you can plan on using at least 2 - 7 or 8 bags of ice by the time you get finished with the hardening if you decide to harden in the wooden barrel. That was not a problem. I had time between the processes to go get some. It was very noisy just as everyone said, but it was worth it. The noise is similar to a circular saw. I used the Vanilla recipe that came inside the booklet and added the crushed up 30 pieces of cookies in the last 10 minutes. I would suggest to add them in the last 5 if you want more pieces present. The first time I opened it midway through to put the cookie pieces in, the mixture looked just as runny as when I started so I thought "Dang, this isn't going to work." But, I heard the motor start working harder like the book said I would. I knew it was getting time. I went almost 5 minutes once I heard the change in the sound. When I opened the top of the container, it was magically ice cream.

4102	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't love this vacuum cleaner any more if I tried!! I can't even remember how long it's been since we purchased the first one, I can't think of a time in my life when we didn't have one of these magic machines actually! We have 4 different residences that require vacuums and we have at least one of these at every residence... plus like 2 extras,  one is used only for cleaning out our vehicles. Like I would rather vacuum out my car at home with one of these babies before I go to the car wash as opposed to using their vacuums that don't even almost compare to my Mighty Mite!! Only problem I have is that the new versions come with a brush head that isn't nearly as good as the old ones that came with them years ago. The brush end that had the actual brush bristles on it. I can't even find any to buy separately for all my vacuums. I only have one from the original. Everytime I use one of the vacuums that has the new edition of the brush end on it the whole time I'm just wishing I had brought my old trusty bristle head end with me! So if Mighty Mite could are least sell those as an add on I would be in Heaven. But anyways,  if your trying to decide to get this vacuum or not... do it!! You won't regret it!!!

1250	Home_and_Kitchen_5	NEG	1.0	I had used this blender for blending "soft" drinks like shakes and smoothies without ice, but after using it ONCE for blending with frozen strawberries, the plastic part that drives the blender mechanism broke.  It's made of a hard plastic and not a softer plastic that has some give to it as many other blenders do.  This is definitely not something I would expect from Cuisinart.  Very disappointed.
3275	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	This is a great pressure cooker.  We owned the similar model to this one, just not induction-compatible, for over 10 years and it worked flawlessly.  This model seems to be of the same quality and after having used it to cook fresh corn and other vegetables I would definitely recommend it.  Works great with our induction stove and only takes about 2 to 3 minutes at the most to come up to temperature.  Assembly was quick and easy...just the handles to screw on... and all the parts fit very well.

This cooker works great and is idiot proof to use.....even for me! The manual that is included has simple, easy to follow instructions and the recipes included are a bonus. I also purchased 'Pressure Cooking for Idiots" which helped a lot with my introduction to pressure cooking.

9469	Home_and_Kitchen_5	POS	5.0	Bought this for my strong armed son because he actually broke the one that is on one stem.  Since he is the chief potato masher in his house, I thought this would give him better leverage and it should last him awhile.  It is well built and should serve them for years to come.

The handle-  gives you a  good grip so you just cut pizza, not your fingers.
Contrary to what other reviewers have said, however, you CAN separate the two halves of the grater for cleaning or storage, but I was disappointed by how you can barely spread the grater's feet out more than a few inches...I wish it had a full range of movement. As it is, you can only position the feet about 4 inches apart. I was hoping for a wider foot print for things like quesadillas.
