3098	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	If i'm car camping this mattress is perfect. it's comfortable as all get out. the material against your clothing is very plush. I didn't notice any sounds emitting from it when I'd roll from one side to another. I'm not sure if i'd use if on long hiking trips but the comfort it provides may make me think twice about the additional weight. It's easy to blow up and release the air when not needed. I usually use my Therma-rest which is still fine but this mattress lifts me up a good 3 to 4 inches off the ground so I never have to worry about those rocks under your tent.

The knobs start out a little sticky, but you can solve that in five minutes: as mentioned in other reviews, disassemble / wipe off excess grease / reassemble.  Don't be sold on more expensive units that are twice as much (the ones painted red and come from the factory dented and warped) - the quality control on those units is awful and in the end, they do the same thing as this little beauty.

8812	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought the red/medium one to replace the much thinner resistance band that came with my Wii Active (it had torn and I didn't want to use it and have it snap in my face one day). I wasn't sure which one I needed, so I decided that the middle was good. When it came in, it looked like a short jump rope of sorts and it must prove to be quite a work out for those endowed with height (I'm rather short). It's not quite a BAND.. it's definitely more of a TUBE (I was hoping it would be a flat tube). This tube has resistance to it both on the tube itself and when pulling it. As such, it's not recommended to use it with bare feet because you're essentially stepping on tubes of rubber/stretchy material that will leave a mark, especially when you're trying to pull it over your head, which I haven't been able to accomplish. I got it to my shoulders. I guess that's why it's at the "medium" difficulty.

One last bit of advice.  Don't just ask the skate guy at the shop.  Mine told me that you just had to break in the bearings. Don't assume that because they work in the shop they know what they are doing.  I went over to an old school skater  and the fastest teenager I could find and and asked them to check my daughters skates and how they rolled.  The both said the same thing.  The bearings are junk.  Long story short, if the person at the skate shop knows what they are doing, get them to adjust the trucks.  If not, ask an experienced skater.  They will be glad to help.

Comfortably fits one adult and one child age 1-7 or 3 kids with an adult walking alongside or towing it. Can be challenging to steer (one adult) because there's no keel, but that's to be expected. Has held up well so far, although we were careful to avoid sharp rocks or dragging it on gravel etc.
215	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	One of the main reasons why I ordered this product was because it was elligible for Amazon Prime and it had good reviews. When the product was delivered it came in a small rectangle box and inside the box was the resistance band and the door anchor with a note from the company as well as a mini instruction book. I usually buy products from sellers who have a good customer service reputation and I read from several reviews that this company had good service so that was another reason why I bought this product. Anyways, I bought this product so I could use it for shoulder workouts, they provided a small book with workouts that you could do. I've been using the resistance band for a day and you could easily tell that these bands are made with good material and are not cheap :). I am a 5'6 female and I weigh 120 lb. so I don't really have any problems with it going too far or being too long for me to use but I thought the door anchor could have been made with a better material. That didn't really matter to me because it is still effective, though I am planning on buying a separate door anchor just to be safe! Overall this product is good and I am planning on updating this review after a month of use.

4712	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	This stove is very reliable and easy to light but is pretty much only useful for boiling because its two settings are off or nuclear meltdown.  It is very difficult to set it to simmer to cook things like scrambled eggs or even bacon.  The knob sort of springs back in the direction that you had it set in last and to get it to simmer you have to turn it as low as you possibly can and hope it doesn't spring back too much.  I just ordered a dual fuel stove which should have a better simmering capability.

343	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I had lost overall body strength due a painful hip injury that really hampered my mobility and limited my ability to exercise. I've recovered from surgery and I'm now catching up on recovering strength using this product.  I feel that the continual and steady resistance the bands provide through the entire exercise motion is more efficient in strengthening the targeted muscles than free weights. Steady resistance is much harder to maintain with free weights.  Even at light resistance, these bands provide that steady pressure that can be increased as the muscles strengthen, plus you can hold the pressure at any point during the motion simply by stopping for a count of 3 or 5, etc. This works great, for example, on bicep curls if you hold on the return motion when your elbows are at 90 degrees; makes you feel the burn! This system is allowing me to regain strength slowly, easily and steadily. The bands, the couplings, the handles, etc., are all well-designed and made of high quality materials.  Very well-satisfied with the quality of the product and the efficiency of the system. A big plus is that the set and the system travel very well!

4540	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Very good camping stove for an attractive price.  Works great, cooks fast, simple to use and utilizes cheap propane tanks for gas.  The only issue I have come across is trying to adjust the flame.  The controls are not really meant for fine control so turning it on and having it go full blast or somewhat less is no problem.  Trying to get a low flame to cook slowly or just keep food warm is much more difficult.  You either don't get a low enough flame or accidentally shut it off.
4642	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this stove to use while car camping for a two week road trip this fall. It worked flawlessly. The burners cook food quickly, almost too quickly. Certainly it would be difficult to simmer or slow cook anything on this stove. While the nobs allow you to adjust the power of the flame, the reality is that there's really only a variation on the high setting. If you try and get a low flame, it will likely burn out. The good news is that it is rare that anyone would need a low heat for camping. We cooked sausage, eggs, beans, etc., without problem. Boiling water was so fast!

If you don't feel the burn after 10 repetitions, you are doing the exercise wrong. In all exercises, it is the eccentric portion of the exercise that builds muscle.

However the red front wheel was rubbing in plastic inside the front fork.  I had to use a utility knife to cut away some of the plastic inside the front fork.  I am surprised because these were the wheels recommended for my scooters, and I specifically chose the Razor brand wheels over much cheaper aftermarket ones to avoid fit issues.  Still, my son is riding happily on his scooters, so overall it was worth it.

I hung it exactly as the rules require (according to the provided rule sheet, anyway). I really like the way the darts sink into the board, and out of maybe 100 tosses I had one bounceback. A word about the darts: don't buy the board for the darts--they are cheaply made. I've already broken one. It landed off, and the shaft snapped where the plastic meets the metal. I'll be replacing the darts for certain, but the board itself is well worth $25. Also, the three black "feet" included are to be installed on the back of the board. Mine had three black dots, indicating where to install the feet. The feet help the board sit level on the wall, and they really need to be installed for the best performance.

Other Notes:
This will help my 9yr/old son improve his shooting and passing as well, but he has already begun using it to practice goalkeeping.  He kicks hard from about 20 feet out at slight angles, and then has to move quickly to cover the rebound.  The ball comes off of the rebounder at surprisingly strong and fast pace.

The sides and top/bottom are different sizes. Either way works, but one results in alot more slack in the net! I measured them to know which should be on the sides. There is more slack in the net than I would have expected...not tight at all.

-You can use the bands themselves like you would for regular weights for most muscle building exercises.  The big difference is that resistance bands have a different strength curve than weights, so you work your muscles in different ways  (at the end of the rep, the resistance will be the greatest, whereas regular weights will either be constant or decrease)

6328	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was quite excited when this frisbee was delivered. Unfortunately it was followed by a few of consecutive rain. After that we had the best evening of the year.... so it seemed. After about 10 minutes of adrenaline pumping action, a bystander wanted to give it a toss. He went to throw it and mistakenly winged it at about 25 mph and it took off like a rocket headed to Mars. I chased it down thinking to myself "I can get this before it goes too far". I chased it down to find out it flew into the lake and sunk. I will be buying again and remember to play further from the lake.


So far, it's been pretty good. The lever to fold the scooter down is very difficult to press, but it doesn't get folded very often. That's the only complaint we have so far.

One note of caution to mountain bikes and hybrid riders with suspensions - allow some slack across the suspension area of the front forks or you'll snap the wire the first time you compress/decompress the suspension hard.  Oh and if you are old like me and can't see worth a darn, get some powerful readers to follow the instructions!

4819	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	As long as you don't mind cooking your food on high all the time this is a great little unit.  You see, the knobs stick and there is no granularity in the settings.  No problem if you're trying to warm a kettle of water, a bigger problem if you're trying to cook pancakes and eggs for breakfast.  My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one), and it worked great.  You're on the right track, but keep looking...stay with propane, but away from this model.  I've seen others comment with this same concern, so it is a quality control/product issue.

Design: I can't figure out if this is just an issue that affects some or if it's related to getting the elastic bands lined up properly, but the frame on my unit twists.  This only happens if the unit is lifted or moved, but if you set it down and jump a couple times, the frame evens out.  You can tell the frame is not set right when the legs are pointed really far in or out.  I check all the connections and tightened the bolts but still it tends to twist.  The frame is 4 parts to a circle.  Two of the parts connect by inserting a smooth crimped metal piece into a hole.  The other two connections are bolted.  I think the issue is the smooth crimped parts are not tight enough to hold the unit in flat position and the tension of the bands can cause the unit to get off centered.  I posted some pictures to the product image gallery to show these different type of connections.  Even though the unit does this, I have been able each time to straighten it out enough to use it and it works great.  I have no concerns about any safety issues resulting from this problem.

To get full power (other than using a pendulum cast), hold the rod high in the air with arms completely outstretched and heave with everything you have. This pole is very heavy. It takes some effort to throw anything. Don't even think about using this rod for plugging. You would be worn out in 20 minutes and you can't feel anything at the end of the line anyway.

Good: has 5 legs, elastic bands instead of metal springs, quiet bouncing, affordable, the size is suitable for kids, and indoor use. Bad: the joints in the rim could be more rigid, the rim changes shape, making the legs point in odd inward and outward directions. The legs have some risk of caving in, hence my recommendation is for kids only. A single person can assemble the trampoline, but once going past 120 degre angle towards 180 degree, there is no turning back, you have to finish the job in one sitting, or the rim will forcefully whack you in the face if you try to bail out.

Then you just put whichever strength band you'd like through the strap, and you're set to start training! A nifty little exercise booklet comes with the set, and it's an excellent workout. I can't wait to integrate it into my regular workout, as you can use these to train so many different body areas that you can kiss using machines at a the gym goodbye. Not to mention that since the bands allow you to weight train while moving more naturally (unlike machines, which have you doing the same motion again and again), these are also safer to use than the machines. I also get to avoid the unpleasant testosterone-poisoned jerks at my gym and weight train at home, which is always a plus. :)

8006	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great idea for kids.  It's especially fun since it glows in the dark.  I bought it for my grandson, and he's having a great time with it. The price was right, and the shipping was very fast!
958	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	The bands arrived filthy and covered in dirt.  The handles have crud on them and are dented.  Definitely not a new item.  So disappointing.
6873	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very handy, especially when the faucet is not nearby.
The construction is firm and its pretty easy to adjust the angle of deflection by opening the clamp on each tube, sliding it in, and then closing the clamp again.  The tubes aren't loose.

We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides, like a taco.  Hold it in place for a minute, and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim.  The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.
Overall I'm happy with the purchase I just wish they changed the design to incorporate an outside battery door and it would get 5 stars from me.

4732	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Need more power! This thing is great just used it over the weekend at Camp Pendleton. Good is it puts out a lot of even heat. A lot! Bad is you need a whole bottle of gas for a weekend.  Good, it had two burners and you can put a griddle across the two burners and make pancakes, sausages, scrambled eggs, etc. I found that the distance from the burner to windblock was insufficient for my 8" cast iron skillet to sit centered on the burner. The wind locks in back and on sides work great. Also, after first use it will show signs of use as in heat discoloration on grill and burners. It doesn't have a handle so you will have to carry it with two hands or under your armpit or in a beach buggy. Yes I would buy it again and yes I would recommend this product.
I do not recommend this mirror for bicycling in traffic.  You cannot see cars approaching.  You will hear cars and see them by turning your head slightly long before they show up in this mirror.  Nice mounting design but I cannot believe an experienced parts supplier like Bell would not notice the absolute uselessness of this mirror for bike safety.

Conclusion: If you want a real "life saver" from a distance, choose the Storm. If it's too big for your taste, choose the Fox 40 Classic. The Acme 2000 would be a runner-up. Throw the rest away or give them to your little children to play with. At 1/4 mile they are barely heard.

To be fair, I'm trying to base my review on the item that I received and not on knowledge of prior problems, but it is not easy to forget about the prior issues as I was and am concerned that something that I got with my soccer playing grandson in mind may not hold up and work long enough for him to actually even enjoy.

Overall, I prefer my older one but the performance of this one has been adequate, no problems.
I bought these for physical therapy because I was in a car accident. I'm 105lbs, in a wheelchair, and only have 1 arm that I can use. This should prove that I couldn't possibly push these bands passed their breaking point. I used this product a total of 4 times and during one of my exercises I heard the threads ripping so I stopped to check. Good thing I did because taking a metal carabiner + rubberband to my broken leg or arm would have been extremely painful.

You'll face resistance sooner in your motions, and thus you'll have to use lesser-than-other-anticipated weighted-bands and just do more reps to get the same effect. This logically means stressing the bands more (though I've only used mine a few times, and thus haven't witnessed this yet and so am only theorizing based on the feel of the bands when I use them and my gut feeling).
2254	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great trike!  The bolt that holds the handle bars needs to be really tightened.  I thought I wrenched on it pretty good and my two year old moved it easily...so I had to go back and tighten it up.  But a nice trike...made well and goes together easily!

But the garter strap below the knee was fine. Elbow pads fit fine. Also, DO NOT TEAR the mesh bag that it comes in. I almost made the mistake. The top part of the black mesh bag has a draw string.

After a ton of research, this is the compass I settled on...and in no way do I feel that I settled!  This is a great, durable compass that has everything you need to navigate efficiently in the back country.  If you are inexperienced with the use of this type of compass, it comes with detailed instructions.  The declination adjustment is very fluid with the adjustment tool provided.  Everything about this device says quality...You get what you pay for and I truly feel this is worth every penny.  I have no doubts after several years in the military with inferior compasses that this one is far superior.  I would trust it with my life.  My family appreciates the quality of this compass in in the event that I have to rely solely on this to get me to safety, it will do the job.  Not to mention, it doubles as a signal mirror.  Great product...extremely happy with my selection.

3066	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I don't know if I'm being dumb but while I really like this mattress for camping because it doesn't deflate or feel cheap, I also cannot figure out how to deflate the thing without pinching the air valve and pushing the air out. I took this camping last month and it was great for sleeping. Very sturdy, didn't deflate overnight or squeak/make noises when I moved around and was pretty easy to inflate with my hand pump, overall a great mattress. But when it came time to pack up, I was sweating and stressing because it literally took me 15 minutes of squeezing and pinching to get all the air out. Maybe I'm missing something or just need to master the deflation technique. Otherwise, I really like this mattress and I like that it rolls up pretty well so it's not super heavy or bulky to pack away when you're not using it.

Its strudy, all steel, with real crome.  And to make it even better, it has streamers and a bell.  Yes the bell is metal.  I thought they stopped making good quality bikes for toddlers, but i found a gem.  You won't be disappointed.  By the way, we did get my other grandson one.  Now they have matching Radio Flyers..

After daily use for about a year for trips to/from preschool as well as travel by car and in airplanes, it has held up very well, with hardly any visible signs of use (despite the usual treatment from a 4-year-old boy). The colors have also stayed bright and vivid, pretty much just like they were when we first bought it.  Also, the zippers are excellent -- very easy for little hands to work, yet strong and not easily jammed up. Would definitely buy it again.
6237	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	Rather disappointing. Not as loud as my Army MP whistle form 1980 (which I still have and use). I wanted this for emergency use, I saw a great video about the invention of the unit and how it came to be, and I thought it's be really loud.  It's more hype that real use and I am disappointed, but for the price it is a hassle to return or complain about, especially since I used it (it touched my lips, ewww). It's not even loud enough to get my dog's attention.
1099	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This set is great.  Does what it's suppose to and easy to interchange.  I got these for P90X and find myself liking a lighter set-up and heavier set-up.  You'd need 2 sets of handles for that, but this set is great otherwise.
The valve is terrible.  Remember the pool toys?  Ya, it's that kind of valve.  As long as you don't mind blowing it up manually, then you're fine. (It didn't take that long, I just wish they made it a wider valve)

Don't buy it.

8138	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I have used a few different compass designs over the years and prefer to sighting type compass. I occasionally use a base plate compass when backpacking while carrying a GPS device. The mc-2 is the best of both worlds for me because the sight through base plate functions like a base plate compass and the sighting portion of the mc-2 has such a large cover that the base is actually extended when fully open allowing for accuracy when plotting a course. The large mirror also allows for signaling and camp use. This allows me to leave my signal mirror at home. This is my second mc-2g and I own two M-3gs but prefer the mc-2 due to the above reasons.

Made in Korea, zoomed smoothly, versatile, stayed tight on the mounts and consistently accurate. After putting about 500rds through it I was amazed that the crosshairs fell apart. That's right. The crosshairs literally fell apart. The lens were fine, scope was never dropped  or abused. Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered. Weird. I liked the scope I paid $79.99 retail, and it appeared to be top quality. It held up well. I guess too many rounds went through it. Pretty disastrous failure if your'e hunting for food.

For me the combination of robustness with relatively small size means that although you have to be more careful taking a bearing off a map you get the advantage of compactness which provides easy portability. And the lanyard means you can tie it off to a button or other means of retention so that you don't lose it when crawling through the bush or when the wind is howling round the peak.

4811	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my husband for his birthday in April. We used it in June/July for camping since there are no fire bans all over Arizona. It boiled water super fast! We were able to use both burners at the same time and still have dinner done within a timely manner. Didnt even go through one bottle of propane and we were camping for 4 full days only using this stove.
I just work on curls, triceps and some shoulder and stomach exercises.  Nothing that takes more than 30 minutes.
The lid latches very securely on both sides and the rods snap very securely easily in and out on the top. Everything in the bottom is loose.

508	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I use these daily in my workouts since I workout at home. I use them in place of any cable exercises and for increased resistance for some body weight exercises. I've used some with plastic clasps before and it was a huge mistake, they snapped on me. These are very strong and you can tell they are well reinforced. The handles are soft to use.

9172	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I use the Kastmaster in medium to large sizes for light saltwater fishing. They cast amazingly well and the flash they give off attracts fish. The only thing I do not like is the teble hooks. The trebles are hard to get out of bluefishs' toothy mouths and they do a lot of damage to weakfish. they also snag more frequently if you try boucing the lure off the bottom. An appropiraite sized single hook will not lead to lot fish.  I replace the standard  hooks with single hooks dressed in buckskin..

8490	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Not that many "silver/stainless steel/ss" scopes out there, so choices are limited. I never buy high-end scopes because I will break it within a couple of years because of rough usage and carlessness. So, this scope jumped out at me for the money and it proved to be a best buy" in my opinion. It was practically centered (took 3 rounds to center), and after putting 500 rounds through the mini14, it hasn't drifted at all. I run a tactical training program so the 500 rounds were fired by five students at 100 rounds each, and carried through an obstacle course to boot. The rig took some falls and hits, but nothing has taken-out the scope yet. Also, I've read that the min14 is particularly hard on scope reticles, so I use a Buffer Technologies Recoil Buffer (also  bought through Amazon), but I don't really don't know if that helps the "reticle problem" or not.

Start with short distances.  You'll be surprises how easily you can overshoot your target by 100-200 feet.
3696	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I have so far bought two of these pumps at Target and neither worked.  I purchased the first and charged it for 12hrs.  It was then unplugged and turned on.  It ran weakly for about 10 seconds, then shut off.  The wall outlet was working, so it had to be a product issue.  I returned it and got another unit of the same type.  The exact same problem occurred.  I tried changing wall outlets and charging it for the max of 24hrs in the owners manual.  It still didn't work.  I don't usually don't give 1 star reviews, but after having two fail in a row, I have no basis to give anything else.

I might just buy another set.
* Takes four AAA batteries (not included), two in each ear cup - some reviewers claimed that they couldn't figure out how to insert the batteries, but I suspect that they didn't read the instructions. See my video showing the easy procedure.
I spray-frosted some windows using this and never smelled the odor or coughed.
864	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I haven't used these on a daily basis because I like to switch up my workouts but I have zero regrets! Every time I use these I'm not in fear of the bands snapping. They are extremely durable and the handles are super comfy. I love how you can quickly go from one band to the next with the quick connect. I'm a little skiddish about using the door mount just because I'm phobic about it coming back and snapping me in the face but besides that this was a great buy! Everything fits beautifully back into the the bag after my workout and stores nicely on the shelf!

I like the fit on the outer part of the eye and they seem to stay in place well.  Tinted for a bit of sun protection.  My 6 year old stole them and she likes them as well so I'm getting her a pair.  They have the old school tightening straps which to me is ok.
75	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	What good product. Got one for my Granddaughter and one for myself
1542	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Design flaw:  The lower cross-bar (along the front that sits at the bottom), bends slightly upward in the middle due to the tension of the elastics holding the net tight.  So, if you kick the ball along the ground, even with a strong kick, it hits the bar and not the net, so there is no "rebounder" effect.  I and my boys (ages 7 and 8) were really disappointed by this, so unfortunately, after the initial couple of trials and disappointments, it's never been used.
5733	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Arrived fast, well packed as described. So far my soon to be tween loves it, and so do I.

I have a neck traction device that I like to use, so I'm no stranger to the "lightening" feeling of spinal decompression. On my first full "hang," the decompression effect was immediately noticeable.

I bought our elite at Wal-Mart for $11.00 and my fide loves it!! We can back 8-12 sandwiches, fruit, water, juices cookies and more. It kept every thing cool despite the 90-degree weather.

2287	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Classic looking trike for our 3 year old; he got on right away and pedaled through the house as soon as he got it.

I have been using this as my primary outdoors knife for some time now, and I really have no complaints. I've used it for everything from cutting cord to batoning firewood. I even used it to hack through light brush on one occasion. The blade retains an edge well, and I have no questions about the structural integrity of the knife overall. It's light, and just the right size for an all-around utility knife. The partly serrated blade makes the piece especially versatile. The sheath is holding up very well, and I typically keep fire-making materials in the pouch. I can't say that I've extensively tested every offering at the $50-$60 price point, but I can say that I'm pleased with the purchase and am more than comfortable heading off the trail with the SEAL Pup.

6064	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I recently bought this DVD after borrowing this one and Bryan Kest's Yoga for Weight Loss.  I love them both.  They are paced at an intermediate level, so if you are advanced in your practice you might not feel as challenged as his Sweat/Energize/Tone set.  I felt this one was perfect for me,as it gave me poses I felt I was good at, a few I needed to modify (at least for now) and ones that I am trying to master.  This keeps me challenged, and that is what I am looking for in a workout.  Most of all, to get the complete benefit, you need to pay attention to the breathing, which is the most important aspect of doing your yoga practice.  I do this workout at least once a week and alternate with strength training, aerobic work outs and just about anything that will keep me interested and motivated.  The one drawback is that he talks way too much at the beginning of the class.  This easily could have been done at the introduction section.  Other than that, I felt this was a wonderful addition to my yoga practice and would suggest to anyone that would like a change in pace from their normal workout.

I need to use dumbbells for flyes and triceps kickbacks, but do not want to do them on a weight bench. This mat is perfect for sparing my shoulders and knees contact with the cement floor. Very comfortable, enough padding, and the faux leather doesn't look or feel cheap.
5703	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I have bought this knee and elbow guard pads for my niece to let her learn to ride scooter. I ask her to fall artificially hard on the ground with her knee bend. She did not feel any pain and uncomfortable. I ask her to knock her elbow hard on the wall. Again she has no complain on pain. She find that it is comfortable on her knee and elbow as the inside material is soft and external material is hard. It can really protect her from a great fall.
2209	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I purchased these for two purposes.  The immediate use was a hike along the Nova Scotia shoreline.

They are great - easy and quick focus, good quality and perfect for fast access.  Overall, very happy with these.

It is my everyday carry and I'm totally loving it.
Getting the boots to the bar was easy; my major concern was being able to get my hands back up to the bar to dismount (particularly after a very silly jerry-rigged inversion scheme that nearly backfired, no pun intended). I sort of "climbed up" my own legs and it wasn't a problem. As other commenters have mentioned, the boots tend to be uncomfortable around the ankles, but since my hanging intervals will probably be relatively short, I can deal with it.
9382	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is one of my most prized lures. Years ago when they first came out I bought 3 of them before my trip to Canada.
9/3/12 - Since purchasing this for myself, I've purchased 2 more for my now 11 year old daughter and wife. My daughter and I hunt with it and my wife shoots 3D.
There was a product like this that might have faced a recall, it does seem that a child could kick it and it could come right back at them but I don't see that as a real problem, only something to be aware of.
The size on this thing is the main draw.  You can fit 2 medium-to-large frying pans on this stove at the same time.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Coleman-2-Burner-Dual-Fuel-Compact-Liquid-Fuel-Stove/dp/B0009PUPX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Coleman 2 Burner Dual Fuel Compact Liquid Fuel Stove</a>&nbsp;is quite frustrating to use if you want to do serious cooking, one medium sized pan is too large to fit on it, let alone two.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Coleman-2-Burner-Classic-Liquid-Fuel-Stove/dp/B001D22TQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Coleman 2-Burner Classic Liquid Fuel Stove</a>&nbsp;is pretty much the same as the compact, it just has a red tank and isn't labeled "dual fuel", even though you CAN burn both fuels on it.
I can look through it and see the target fine.  The unit is solid.  It's made in Korea, which surprised me.  I figured it would be Chinese.  I really don't have anything bad to say about it.  We will see how well it holds up.  I probably only have a few hundred rounds through it, but I don't expect 22LR to give it too much of a jarring.


I suppose I should have complained about the loss of the toothpick - especially after Amazon lists it in the "tools" - but I have used the pen once. Wrote the number on my palm for the owner of a lost cat that I happened to find. (Funny thing was that I had my Sony MP3 player with me, but forgot that it also records so the pen is actually superfluous.) The cat and owner were appreciative, and I turned down the reward although I could have bout the smaller knife.
if they are not in a mood to bike - this is it. infact most days they prefer "scooting" to "biking" due to the bulk of the bike and getting in line to park it at school and lock it etc.
Despite two very minor flaws I'm still feel this a "5 Stars" knife.  I mentioned the flaws so you can make up your on mind. In my view, the knife is definite keeper and will please both the collector as well as the outdoors-man/hunter. I suspect it will last long enough to be past down from father to son. It is hard not to give five stars for that kind of quality.
8663	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely wonderful product.  Just what I wanted to help will balance and strengthening.  Recommended by my therapist if I was wanting a balance pad and I do agree.  This should last a very long time into my old age to keep me working!

They're a little stiff for the first couple of uses, but they soon loosen up and work well. They're also compatible with other resistance band handles, so more than one person can use the bands at once (just keep in mind that every band has a different amount of resistance). These are now a permanent part of my workout routine.
9430	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this product not to torture fish (as I think it is a harmful device for fish), but as a device to lift my Kleen Kanteen out of the hot coals. When opened, and inserted inside of the stainless water bottle,, the wires have enough tension to easily lift a water bottle style container safely out of the coals, seeing as the Kleen Kanteen doesn't have a wire bail.  I'm quite sure it would work perfectly  for what it's intended for, but the sharp points will certainly injure a fishes mouth. If you plan on catch & release fishing, this isn't the tool to use. For that, I would give it ZERO stars!
5156	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My son loves it. He uses it everyday to play outdoors and the ball is holding up pretty well with respect to air pressure and appearance. The gold embossing is gone for the most part but overall still has a good grip.

The Aerobie will NOT turn you into an instant expert.  The Aerobie is harder to throw well than a normal frisbee.  It's shape is why.  A frisbee has a lip that curves down and has a much better capability of righting itself if your angle is wrong.  The Aerobie will NOT correct itself at all...not one bit.  It is a blade. The angle at which you release an Aerobie is the angle it will follow.  Don't bend your back.  Stand straight, and extend your arm at shoulder level.  For it to fly straight you have to release it straight...period.  A poorly thrown Aerobie, if thrown hard, will result in you doing nothing but giving your partner a whole lot of unwanted excercise.  Once you get it down...you'll never want to throw anything else.
2096	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great value
1001	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I've actually owned these for a year.  Work muscles at home with door jam attachment and pack for wintering away from home.  I've worked with a trainer ~ these bands fill in just fine when needed.  I thought they might stretch out of shape but that hasn't happened.  I'm focused on upper body strength to ward off further loss of bone density.  Pro-active for strength seems like the a good plan.  I've been happy with Black Mountain Resistance bands.  I use these bands twice a week.
This product is not a traditional 'wax' e.g. you don't put it on, let it dry, then remove; it needs to be 'worked into' the surface material some then removed.  I've found that you can apply by hand but to do it the 'right' way requires It be applied with a good amount of pressure.  I use a 9" Sears random orbital buffer with applicator pad and no matter if I wipe it off by hand or with a series of removal pads on the buffer, the end result is absolutely fantastic.  More is not better with this product, use as light a coat as you can or it can become a chore to get it off / smoothed out.

The resistance level is just right for each of us, and they are the generally agreed upon colors.  They're also the standard length.
- quick and easy- You can use one band or multiples, it is quick to change bands and workouts, and you don't have to detach the bands to put them through the door strap.
In the end, I will live with the (could be better) size markings, be happy that all the size increments are included and look forward to picking up the Chicago Pneumatic 3/8 drive size version of these sets.

The Explorer has two inflatable compartments.  The outer body of the raft is one compartment, while the second consists of the floor inside the raft.  While it is certainly possible to inflate the raft manually by using lung power, it is much easier to use some kind of pump.  Using a small foot pump, it takes me about 10 minutes to inflate the raft.  To avoid a slow leak, make sure that the plug is inserted very securely.
1472	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this cooler more than 4 years ago (at Pathmark, a regional supermarket) and it's still going strong. I've gotten a lot of good use out of it during summers, mostly for ice tea for BBQ's. Build quality is excellent and construction is sturdy. It's strong enough for a grown adult to sit on when there aren't enough chairs. (I'm 160 pounds). I like the bright "Home Depot orange" color. It's fun and easy to spot from far away. The side has a cup holder, but I never use it as it's clumsy to keep attached and most of my cups are bigger than the holder.
8871	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These bands are great additional tools for home gyms or even commercial gyms. I loop them over the pull up bar to use them as cable machine type of workout. But it doesn't have the constant resistance like the dumbbells or weights have. Use biceps curl as an example, when you pick up a 40lbs dumbbell from the rack. It gives you that 40 lbs resistance at the moment it lift off the rack, and continues to do so in any position of the exercise. VS these resistance bands have virtually no resistance at the starting position of biceps curl exercise. Its resistance increases as you raise the forearm and decreases as you lower the forearm back to the starting position. You don't get the constant resistance as the weights give you. So if you're serious about body building, then weights/dumbbells are a must and probably are more effective than these bands.
They are pretty good for shooting. I can get a decent cheek weld on my M4 with an ACOG or AimPoint with these on. They are definitely better than the behind the neck variant of the ear muffs.

First of all, I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product. It is unreasonably heavy, very heavy. It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles, but its not the best idea. If you apply it on narrow saddle, than you cant fix this cover at all. It moves and slips all the time. Fixing strand is another bad idea. In fact, I can't find any positive point in this product thus I can't recommend it. Don't waste your money!

So the first thing I did when I got them today was to check them out for that. I EASILY popped both sides open and snapped them shut in much less than a minute total. It is not physically demanding nor mentally challenging by any stretch. ANYONE can open these easily. Whatever the problem some of you might be having, I don't get it.

My next choice was the Stansport Outfitter Series 2-burner stove (212-50) which was updated for 2017 and not currently carried on Amazon, but is available at other outlets like WM. The Stansport is identical to the Camp Chef, but supposedly has better flame control according to reviews. I also looked at the Coleman Eventemp and Triton stoves, but I ended up getting the basic Coleman Classic Propane Stove and am VERY happy I did.

I want to give an update after a year of play. Wilson did pick up a couple scuffs from hitting the cement or chain-link fence surrounding the court. Nothing too huge. I think I screwed up though. I always left him in my car because we played every week in a bar league and would sometimes play on weekends at family events and such. I didn't take him out before winter set in. Recently I came across him in my trunk and the seams are splitting. I'm 99% sure this is thanks to the MN cold, it wasn't like this last time we used him. I think he is still playable, but he looks all battered now :(  So don't make Wilson live out in the cold over winter, whether a shed or trunk. Bring him inside and make him a part of your family. That is all he wants after all.
Intex makes a pool product called a Tote N' Float Wave Mat that also works and that I've used since my camping mattress disappeared and it works great, but it's not nearly as solid, durable or robust as this. It also isn't as comfortable. And here's the thing: Comfort matters.
2820	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Sturdy, well built, it's hard to actually know the size visually of the balls, I had hoped this one would be a little larger, but still serves the purpose for my workouts. I encountered sizing problem while looking at different brand balls, not just this brand. I feel the ball will hold up and endure. I would order from this company again.
1205	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for resistance bands to help with strength and conditioning for taekwondo.  These really fit my needs quite well since the package comes with a door attachment and ankle strap that allows me to train without a partner.  The tubes clip to the handles/ankle strap/door attachment with spring loaded clips rather than just sliding into some fitted slot, and they seem very secure.  I wasn't too sure I would like the metal clips at first, but they are very secure.  I've not seen the door attachment on other products, but this accessory is pretty slick, at least for my purposes.  Rather than attach to the doorknob or under the door, the attachment consists of a nylon strap with a ball inserted into one end.  The strap is then inserted between the door jamb and the door and is secured in place when you close the door.  What makes this work so well for me is that I can adjust the height of the anchor; low for kicking drills and higher for hand techniques.  The variety of tubing is also more useful than I thought.  I had anticipated needing only one heavy band for my training, but my 8 year old son and wife also like the bands and use lower resistance than I do.  All in all, a very neat little package for the price.
3676	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I've used this mattress several times now, both while camping and visiting other people's houses. I haven't had any trouble with leaks like I did with a previous more expensive brand. I like the wrap n roll storage too. The pump does seem a bit flimsy, but it's still working fine, and deflates it quickly too. Be sure to push in the valve all the way. I'm considering getting one for my daughter for a guest bed. I've found it to be very comfortable too. As with any air mattress, you just need to find the right amount of air.

With either choice to inflate the Sock'em Boppers you will need to avoid over inflating and should stop before filling it too tightly with air. When the hand has been inserted you just need to make a fist and this will keep the pillow secure in the hand of the child playing. It does not hurt when you are punched by the Sock'em Boppers and let's kids get rambunctious in a fun productive way. Caution children when playing not to hit near the face and eyes and to avoid sharp and hot objects when using the pillows. This is not a flotation device.

They are perfect for a trip to the park,  t-ball, baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store, haul, carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!

Before, I would always buy the 2.5 gallon rectangular water containers from the grocery store and they would double as drinking water, as well as faucet water for hand and face washing, since they have a sort of valve or dispenser. This carrier makes things easier because it is much easier to refill and the faucet works smoothly allowing you to open and close the tap easier. As the water is dispensed, its pliable design collapses it which makes transport and storage easier when empty. The handles seem solid enough to move the carrier around when full and allow you to stand it up in a couple of different ways without being so flimsy that it easily falls over.

5438	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I think, for the price, these are a great product. They fit nicely and don't fog up. The straps are a little hard to adjust but I have never seen any that weren't. I purchased two pairs and well buy more when needed. Speedo quality is first class.

Well I get on my Razor and start gliding through the halls. I'm sure I've been caught on security cameras roaming the hallways. But so far no security guards have come to stop me. I bet they wish they had one for themselves. My only wish is that the handle bars would telescope up a couple inches higher. That way I wouldn't have to stoop down to hold the bars.

3316	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These are good basic mattresses that are comfortable to sleep on. The non-slip textured side is helpful for sleeping because it helps keep you on the mattress and is not as noisy as the flat rubber side. It was a bit difficult to inflate them because you only have the smaller valve and the internal design of the valve makes it difficult to insert the air pump nozzle. It only takes up a little space when not in use, which is helpful when trying to maximize efficient space usage during travel.

1532	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Really unhappy with this purchase. I purchased as a gift for my niece and nephew and they just set it up with weather clearing up. After about 10 minutes of kicking balls at the goal the net broke. This was from a 4 year old boy and 8 year old girl. I played college soccer so I hate to see what would happen if I kicked a ball at it. Because we took awhile to set it up while the weather warmed up I can no longer return it. I wouldn't recommend this goal as I am not sure it will last long.
2859	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Unfortunately Razor scooter's rear wheels develop flat spots from braking.

The product is very well made and is just like the ones I use at the gym. There's a lot of choice out there when it comes to resistance bands, but I believe that you cannot go far wrong with SPRI.

I had to use a machine pump and it still took 10 minutes. I would HIGHLY recommend buying some sort of handheld pump with an adapter to fit the air nozzle for this mattress. I'm sure they sell them here or on ebay, a bike shop too. Other than that I have no complaints. For hikers and backpackers, survivalists, buy an adapter and hand pump with an adapter. Buy some gorilla tape or patches to fix it up if there's a hole.

My hip bones don't touch the ground at all and hold nearly all it's air throughout the camping week. It's heavy not for backpacking but that's why I like it.

The screw top has a compliant seal that helps make the closure water tight every time.  The cap is not secured in any way (one possible quibble).  You could always secure it to the neck with some nylon string.  The threads are fine and that sometimes makes it momentarily difficult to thread the cap on.

2528	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought mine when i was in my teens and have had it ever since. I have lost it a few times and came across it usually during a move or when I was looking for something else. Always happy to see it. It fits nicely in the small change pocket above the right front pocket of my levis. Its not to big at all and great for everyday stuff. My son will surely get this one when he is of age.
I tested the unit by walking around the block, counting the steps and comparing my count to the number on the readout.  To my amazement, it was less than one percent off.  I had heard that anything within 15 percent was acceptable.  My disappointment came in the "routine" wearing of the unit the next day.  First, it must be worn clipped on clothing or the belt at waist line, like most models.  But the readout is then upside-down for the wearer.  It is very difficult to glance down and check the number.  Like most digital readouts, the 2 and the 5 as well as the 6 and the 9 are easily confused if trying to read upside-down.  This means taking the unit off if I wanted to look at it, which brought about the second problem.  The reset button is fairly large and nearly impossible to avoid touching when removing or installing the unit onto my belt.  At the end of a long walk, I glance down to see that I have accumulated 4 digits of steps, but removing the unit to read the number erased the total.  I was disappointed enough in the product that I returned it to the store for a full refund, with no problem.  I'm glad that I shop at REI for no hassle returns and knowledgeable staff.  Very little thought about practical use went into the design of this product by the manufacturer.  There are better models for the same or similar cost.

6592	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great deal for this knife!  I own several SOG knives some made in the USA, some in Taiwan and some in China. They're all quality knives with the US being the highest and most expensive of the bunch and Taiwan running a close second.  This is a nice size to carry for almost any occasion. It has a full tang & comes with a nice sharp edge... It is not however a full-size military fighting blade. That is why they call it the "pup"... But it can do the job if called upon to do so ... it has a very serviceable sheath as well.  It's a good all-around size and will fit most any occasion.

FINAL UPDATE:  I love Amazon!  I called customer service about receiving the wrong compass twice.  They refunded both purchases fully, and told me to keep bot hot the compasses!  I used this compass for a Wilderness survival class that had 3 navigation components and the compass worked beautifully.  I don't have the exact baseplate scales I ordered, but this compass may actually be better.  Again:  YEA AMAZON!!!

6693	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I am an avid hunter, fisherman, camper and outdoorsman in general.  To me, one of the hardest knives to find is a good fixed blade knife to take catfishing.  After going fishing several times with my Sog Seal Pup, I now know that my search is over.  This knife is razor sharp right out of the packaging, has a solid grey coating and excellent serrations.  I am not normally a serrations guy, but I found them to be very useful when cutting scaly and boney baitfish.  This knife cut through the bream, perch and herring like it was warm butter.  It also took a chunk out of my finger with the serrations, so be careful.  This is the perfect size fixed blade knife to take fishing as it is not too big or heavy, but robust enough to do some medium to heavy duty chores.  I wouldn't choose this knife as a fillet knife by any means, but in a pinch, it is sharp enough to serve as one.
282	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I looked for a product that was actually made by the seller since I had resistance bands by "big sport brands" snap while working out.

The price of the Explorer 100 seems to vary quite a bit, typically ranging between nine and fifteen dollars.  At the low end of the price range, it is a 5 star buy.  If you stick to a pool, and use this craft as it is intended, you will probably have lots of fun, and not have any major safety issues.  While the raft can certainly be used in the ocean, a lake, or other body of water, it isn't really intended for rough waters.  Overloading or inappropriate use, could have very unfortunate consequences, so safety should always be the number one concern.

I, unfortunately, lost my first set when I was living overseas and bought another one when I came back home and can't imagine using another brand. The quality is fantastic. The bands themselves are very resilient and last a very long time. I haven't had one snap on me yet (and yes, I have had that with other brands, like Gold's Gym) and am very happy with everything BMP includes in the bag. It's very easy to swap out bands, I really appreciate the cheat sheet the include to see the different what resistances is equivalent to what weight, although I wish they would upload a PDF copy of it to their site.
I fished out of the raft for 4 days. I constantly had hooks rubbing against the rubber and never once did it puncture. I was pretty rough against the paddle-holders and they held up nicely. The boat moved through the water rather well for an inflatable raft, no complaints there.

Just unfold it, telescope the handle to the right height, and lock it all down and you are ready to go. Elapsed time under a minute. To store just reverse the procedure. It took longer to get it out of the box than it does to "assemble".

The Classic is an important part of the Frisbee tradition. It isn't my first choice for Frisbee with experienced friends. It does not behave well with wind. After a few seasons the plastic may crack and split as many of the Classic's I've owned have done.

OVERALL: satisfied. when you don't have time to go to the gym to do 45 minutes of strength training, this is a great way to sneak in a few sets at home, while you travel, even at the office. its extremely portable, easy to setup, use and its cheap - the ultimate combination!

1086	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	So far I am happy with the quality of the bands.  Some people complained that having only 2 handles was a problem, but I figure that I will not be changing weight all that often anyway.  I use them for pullups and dips for my young boys. They can't really do many if any pullups without some assistance.  I like the clips because then you can clip them to the pullup bar instead of using the handles at all and then they don't get in the way of where I put my hands.

I liked this knife so much that I bought another one of these babies as they are cheaper than the Seal Pup Elite and just as good in my opinion.  You simply cannot go wrong with this knife for camping chores, fishing or as a hunting knife.  This knife would also serve as a fine survival knife although limited in its ability to chop wood.  I think that it would be sufficient for any bushcraft tasks, but I use it as my fishing knife.  I used to use my stainless steel mora which was good too, but I like this one better because it's more robust, durable and versatile.  The Sog Seal Pup is a VERY SOLID knife that can perform a wide range of tasks, and it is a very reliable all-around blade.  Highly recommended from the Skill-Master as "THE BEST" fishing companion for the money.

It comes with a 12" sleeve that gets cemented in the ground and the pole then slides in/out for use or storage.  We dug a hole 12" deep by 9" wide in the back yard.  After taping off the bottom of the sleeve we placed the bottom half of the two-piece pole into the sleeve and centered it in the hole.  We used string, tent stakes and a level to make sure the pole was plumb, then mixed the concrete and poured.  After setting for a couple of days it was ready to go.  We just pumped up the ball, tied it to the eyelet at the top of the upper pole and connected the two poles.  We did find that the ball was hanging low so we adjusted the tie-off.

While Tamrac builds quality products this is not one of them. I own other products from Tamrac and I expected more from this company. If you order this product plan to replace the water bottle before going on a trip. Normally I would return a defective product but replacing like-for-like accomplishes nothing. The padded case has value but you have to decide if the cost (without the water bottle) is worth it.

4371	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It is what it is.  Received as advertised.  Burners are somewhat susceptible to the wind.
4473	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great for the price. As others have said it is hard to regulate the flame but for the price can't really complain. Was really great to have when camping, would buy again.
6493	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	works great.  flies straight and FAR.  very easy to catch & throw.
4248	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is the most useful tool I've ever owned. I've had it on my keychain for I don't know how many years now. I've also owned probably 5-6 now, since unfortunately they get lost or broken sometimes (more on that below).
2403	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	6 year old loves it.  it works for soccer, hockey and the like.  easy to set up and take down.
3651	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Love It. Reminds me of being a kid again.
6020	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I already had one, so, I knew how to program this device. Once you get familiar with its functions, it is easy to use. It is also quick to install.
9255	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Have used it extensively. Very smooth casting; no backlashes with leftie Abu Silver Max.  Very little memory.
6816	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This fold up so you can easily transport it places without it taking up too much room. The faucet doesn't have much pressure, so don't expect it to come out fast. It works perfect for camping. I use it as a hand washing/ dish washing station. Does the job just perfectly!
8933	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I used these shorts in high school band camp 15 years ago and have used them for working out ever since. Buying more pairs now because the colors eventually started fading. But seriously, they hold up so well over time.
8859	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I opted to order several variations of the SPRI Xertube bands as a cheaper alternative to paying hundreds of dollars for a weight set.  (This was for the P90X exercise program.)  I've completed the P90X program three times... unfortunately, I've had to order several of the bands multiple times... once each time I've done the 90 day program.
423	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great pack to bring along while traveling for a quick easy workout!
1752	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The only reason I would not give it a 5 is because it did not come with a carrying case like some of the other sets. The bases are very very well made (heavy) and perfect for what we needed - just wish we had a case!
1281	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Everything you need in 1 convenient kit. Plus compartments in the bottom to add odds and ends that aren't part of the kit. I use this all the time and it's everything I think I'll need to clean any gun

7068	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great little scooter for kids!
5387	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	these fit my face perfectly (though that's personal). soft, no headache, no leakage
7076	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Grand daughter LOVES it !
I did a lot of research, bought the right goal, and I couldn't be happier.  Now I'm looking for a 12' goal to give my kids a greater challenge.
Has anyone tried using a tricep rope, hand bars, etc attached to the bands on a door? I'm wondering if the triceps rope, bars would damage the bands.

A really well done resource guide.
9817	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Sturdy built.
Which, for a toy that's pretty good because so far, it has been dry-fired a bunch already.
5755	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Good quality. The straps on these seem like they may wear out after some use by kids but so far so good.
5067	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Gift
Way better than ear plugs. I would buy again.
1239	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	GOOD
7998	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	love love the colors and I think it will be a great addition to our soccer ball colllection cant wait to use it
1004	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This product is exactly as I expected it to be!  They are great and provide such a great work out.  Easy to carry around. I bring them back and forth from work to home.  Even my bosses use them!
I purchased this compass for a weekend backpacking trip and wasn't sure whether I should get one w/ or w/o a sighting mirror. Glad I went with this one and can't imagine getting an accurate bearing w/o the mirror.
4823	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This stove is lightweight compared to the rest of the line, easy to clean, gets the job done and it's dependable. It's only problem is that the diameter of the burners is too small, you can't use 12" pots, and it doesn't have enough BTU's to boil water fast. Listen, if space is not an issue, get the Coleman 2 Burner Powerpack Stove. It's a couple of dollars more than this stove. It's quite a bit larger than this stove, and it's as nice as cooking on a gas stovetop at home. You can boil tons of water quick, saute calamari or scallops while you're camping if you're so inclined, or make pancakes for a mob of people on your Lodge Reversable Grill/Griddle. There's some trips I use a single burner backpack stove, and then the rest of the time I'm eatin' homefries and cheese omelette's. You could cook chicken marsala with portobello mushrooms and sage on the Powerpack stove. The stove I'm reviewing is a great stove, just not for a family.
2032	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I ordered these at the direction of my wife. She has developed an interest in bird watching and the greater outdoors. Who knows, this could lead to a new joint endevor. By the way, I actually ordered 2 at the same time. Additionally, I ordered a much physically smaller set of binoculaors for our granddaughter. The 3 of us are going on vacation together. I liked the reviews of the Bushnell Falcon series of binoculars. There are well made and I love the optics. They included eye caps, a nech lanyard and a nice nylon carrying case with strap.
4791	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	hope it works as good as it looks but how can you go wrong with coleman cant wait for hunting
2265	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Quality fabricated metal pieces and easy assembly!
7758	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	An affordable must have for the range
5299	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for my 11 year old son and a bought a pair of the speedo junior hydrospex for my 8 year old son. During the winter they are on swim team and practice indoors so not having the tint/shaded lens work better, they are not constantly removing them to see what the instructor is demonstrating. They do not fog up even after an hour in the pool. No complaints about leaking so the fit is just right. The dual strapping keeps the goggles in place for when they dive into the pool and when they are just messing around. They keep them in the plastic case/packaging so they can just throw them in their swim bag and not worry about scratching or breaking them.
Pros:

6836	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	It held water fine.. I am suspecting that you have to poke a vent hole in the top so water will flow out a lil better.. It sort of trickled out for us with the valve open.

Flat black, no glare, easy to set up, Instructions are foolproof.  very easy to level  reticle.
Wonderful gift
2999	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Works on hundred percent would definitely buy again great for my tent that perfectly did not lose air and I Am 250 lb worth the money all day
3551	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for a two year old. The padding is nice for those shin whacks.
Everything you'd expected in Okuma.
I Illinois they work well on Bass and even crappie. Try and let them drop to the thermo-plane before you crank them in.
Very easy to throw and catch.
3487	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I used these for the bottom of metal feet on a bed, worked out awesome. I can now push the bed easily and no scratches on my floor.
434	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	been working with them for a while know nothing broke or come apart yet use about three times a week sometimes 4 good for toning body
2563	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Very durable item.  Great for all ages.
3861	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	For the price, this dartboard is great and is very sturdy and holds well. However, around the edges the black paint falls off leaving black specs everywhere when touched. The darts that come with it lose their flight quite often but again. For the price, this is a great product.
4704	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It met the expectation I had for it. Easy to pop up, easy to operate.
298	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great product, pleasure doing business.
and shows no signs of wear........real easy to
4596	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The Coleman classic... what is left to say? It does the job. However, I can tell that this is the "cheap" product. The lid doesn't seat right, the latch comes loose, and the knobs are fussy- it becomes difficult to fine-tune the height of the flame. However, all that being said, it works fine. None of those complaints take away from its functionality. I expect it to work for years to come.
6191	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This is a great pedometer but you *must* get the safety leash or at some time it's guaranteed to pop off your belt! Once I played with the adjustment button, it counts my steps precisely--no deviation whatsoever! Another reviewer said only the cobalt blue pedometer resets itself automatically at midnight. This is a critical feature--fortunately I happened to get the right one. It is grossly misleading for the company to sell a model HJ-105 that does not reset just because the color is different!

my Model 58 Remington shotgun and my 220 Swift rifle. I see no way

7801	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a great mask with a great seal around the mask, i also use a pair of no fog goggles and i don't have to waste time trying to see or breath in a dusty loud. Make sure that if you buy a mask it is ment for what you use it for.
- Simplicity. This is a basic stove with almost nothing to break. The burners are one-piece and can be replaced if needed, but I doubt they ever will. There are more than 10 individual parts in the Camp Chef burners and not replaceable. I also like that there is no piezo ignitor to fool with, just use a match or stick lighter. Simple, and I always have them in my camping gear. The needle valves for each burner can be dis-assembled for maintenance or replacement. Couldnt do that on the Camp Chef.
8229	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great compass!
3791	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great dart board! Looks great and easy to put up
8561	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought one of these about a year and half ago and it is still going strong. I use it daily with my two boys who are in the YMCA basketball program. I have my basketball hoop in the driveway so having this ball returner makes it safer to play outside instead of chasing the balls all over the place including the street. One of the clips in the back came off about 8 months of use. I went ahead and put tight wraps on all sides. I never bring this inside.
I put my exercise togs on and started ellipticising, or whatever you call it.  I set the timer for 40 minutes, and made it through 35 minutes of silent sweeaty cardio.  The silent part is nice, because my wife is a writer and comes out and hits me with a broom if I make too much noise.
317	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Like the bands, bought the Kinzi bands and they started coming apart durin 1st workout, will recommend to others!!!
7) Cheap $1.50 whistle\compass\thermometer from DealExtreme
Very happy with this product!

2443	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Quality is ok but little small,  big enough for our 2 kids and they have fun with it.  How long it'll hold up,  who knows,  was inexpensive so worth the 5 stars for the fun factor and the price.

7297	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Very nice scooter that is great for kids, but the back wheel has a slight scraping noise.  It doesn't hinder the riding, but it is annoying.  I tried taking the wheel off and cleaning it and re-lubing it, but its still there
8026	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My son goes to movement and music classes where they use these ribbons often.  He loves it.  We play with it on most nights.  He loves snakes so we have the ribbon slither on the ground for fun times.
I like the nylon sheath with pouch on the front exterior as this gives me an extra compartment to put my swiss champ knife or multitool which is just perfect for fishing.  However, the one drawback is that after cutting a bunch of baitfish for catfish bait and placing the knife back into the nylon sheath, the sheath itself will stink if you don't clean it.  It is very difficult to get scales and blood out of this nylon sheat, so from that standpoint, a kydex or plastic sheath would be better, but you can't beat that extra compartment for the multitool which is essential for fishing tasks.
I needed a utility knife for deployments, and since I went to Haiti, I found this to be the perfect tool.  The knife clip is secure and is stable on my web belt (It is reversible, if you are a left handed user).  The weight of this knife is evenly balanced.
4541	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Only used It once so far but it worked well. Good for the price. Great for the occasional camper and weekend warrior. If you're somebody that goes camping every weekend or going to use this a lot, I would probably want a better one.
1921	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Work fine.  No complaints. Good value.  They sit on my porch and I use them to look a birds, animals and anything of interest that I notice on the street.  No problems.
We used it for rafting at Yosemite river. My husband used it. Nice when the water is not too shallow, so your bottom would not hit the river rocks.
5465	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Not a bad price for the baseballs and bucket.
Unfortunately, the pad seems to be one size, and that size is XXXL.
5139	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	We had these when we were kids although the foot design is different.  This one should last longer than those of 55 years ago and might be safer to boot.
Fun and easy to use
5577	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought these for my son. He uses these for when he skates and rides his mini scooter. Great fit, adjustable and gives him the protection he needs!
In all, i would totally buy these again if my get lost and i'll recommend them to friends if they ask where i got mine.
 As far as the screws are concerned. They come in different lengths. the 1 1/4" thousand pack is good for the common 3/4" woods. That way you get a 1/2" bite into the adjoining material. The fine thread screws are for hardwood, and the coarse thread is for soft.
+ quick focus lever is "quick", easy enough to use with one hand. once you learn the lever, it's almost instantaneous focus.
Bulky
505	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	These are great and I really like the attachment for doing pull-ups and working lats. When I travel not too many hotel gyms have a pull-up bar.
2123	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	CONSIDERING THE COST, YOU CANT GO WRONG.
+ lightweight: easy on the neck and your hand
371	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great product, just as advertised
5320	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Good goggles for kids (above age 8 or 9) and adults.  Comfortable, etc.
I have found that this challenges me more when I am in bare feet. It is also lightweight, so that on a nice day, I take it into the deck to make PT more interesting.
1755	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Perfect set for my son and his friends to play on his 9th birthday.
1368	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It takes sometime to install all these fixtures.  once they are in they are simple and beautiful.
Pros -
8424	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is truly a GREAT scope... Mine, once sighted in for the rifle, has held zero for over a 1000  rounds without need for even a tiny tweak, and that's despite quite a bit of bumping it around over the past 6 months, but of course the rifle in question is also only a .22; I can't speak for any high-power applications. Anyway, this might seem superficial, but the old-fashioned gloss finish is hard to come by these days. Everyone makes scopes flat-black now. Rings too. Well my Father just gave me a brand-new Henry lever-action .22 that he accidently won in an auction when he tried to help get bidding started. he turned out to be the only bidder. He didn't want it to begin with, and upon trying the gun out it shot terribly to the left and tweaking the iron sites didn't help, so he gave it to me for free (not the type of thing my Dad normally would do). So I sought a suitable scope with all the features I wanted, but I also hoped to find one which matched the look and feel of an old-fashioned Henry lever-action rifle. Being that such a rifle is not a precision piece to begin with I wasn't looking to spend a fortune either. Well this scope filled every need and then some. Because the rifle not only looks like a top quality show-piece now, but I was able to compensate for the far off left shot that was originally experienced and now I have a very accurate gun. Dad regrets giving it to me, I think.
We love the protective edging (the blue shower cap thing), because even though it has bands, not springs, someone's foot could still get stuck and falls can happen.  We have 4 kids.  Accidents happen.
1085	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought this set of bands to work on rehabbing my knee outside of the gym. This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.
The Teleflex cables are marked with the part number about 2 feet from the rack (steering wheel end).  Look under the starboard side where the cable runs.  The last 2 numbers are the length in feet for a Teleflex cable.  Time to remove and replace about 45 min.  Be sure to get the wheel centered with the sterndrive centered before bolting up the rack.
5712	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	bought these for my 5 year old. They're too big. He's using the elbow pads for his knees. He just turned 5 and is average height and weight for his age. Although these are much more rugged and more comfortable than the ones were are replacing. They're a bit on the big side so for now we can only use the elbow pads until he can grow a little.


861	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great quality product, would purchase again.
455	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Would order again!
8670	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These bands work very well and very durable. I am still using them until today
5480	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Ball are in good condition. Just what we were looking for.
3320	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've been camping now for about 40 years and so I know what I like. I have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to buy ones camping gear at expensive stores like Ripped-off-on-Every-Item, just because it's cool to have their logo on your stuff. Paying over a hundred bucks for a Thermarest is not necessary either. The extra pack weight of one of these is easily worth it to me for the comfort. This mat is amazingly heavy duty in design and construction and holds its air (unlike today's politicians). This is a fantastic product for the modest price. What really sold me? One guy said that he had used it all summer at the beach -- which means high stress conditions -- and he said that it held its air. These do. Oh, the shoulder width is perfect too,....they were conscious of the need not to be excessively wide -- they were thinking tent. I have wide shoulders and I'm perfect on this one. One last thing: your friends can snicker all they want about their super duper $120 self inflating mats -- but you'll be sleeping 3" above the ground on what feels like a bed. Sorry suckers. LOL.
7615	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great water bottle.  I keep it full in my brief case.
8377	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	So far so good. Nice price and it's a good looking scope.  I can't comment on long term reliability yet, but zeroing the rifle went well and it seems to hold POI.
1418	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for my niece for her birthday, and we had loads of fun with it. Not too big so if you only have 3 adults you can still get the effect of the chute. Kids love playing and running under it while it falls.
7559	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This came nearly assembled and ready to ride.  Within a couple of minutes of opening the box, we had it put together and my son was riding it.  It's a fantastic scooter for the price and it glides along smoothly and quietly.
7968	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is as good as it gets.  First rate quality for that future pitching star.
Overall the compass is a well made example of a classic design and first impressions are very good.  However, on close examination of the compass needle capsule it is clear that the alignment arrow in the base of the compass capsule and the parallel alignment marks/declination scale indicator are slightly offset.  This indicates that the two scales are not concentric.  To get them properly aligned you must set the declination scale at approximately 2 degrees east declination.  This means that the compass capsule (which carries the needle and alignment arrow) is not set on the same center as the movable declination scale!
4435	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	We used this for a short camping trip.  The flame control was not much use.  From all the way on to low was about a sixteenth of a turn, if that much.  Hard to lower to a simmer, without it going out.  Very poor.  Other then that a good stove.
2587	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Good basketball.
8422	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	very nice.draws a lot of light early morning late evening
4215	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to make snow castle.  It is very easy to use.  To make a snow brick, just simply shovel snow into it, put it down, and lift it up slowly.  I could build a castle with 3 walls in no time.
2870	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good product
The Classic is good for pavement bouncing or other things you might hesitate to do with a higher end or more specialized Frisbee.
2007	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	It works great
but they hit the ground a lot and will wear out. Mine are worn out a bit but they still fly pretty crazily but I want a new one soon just for a perfect flight.

9091	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Used for computer chair comfort and car drivers seat comfort. It works cery well in both cases. Especially durable and more dense foam than many such. I used the thinnwr one for 6 or 7 years. Still in use occasionally.
4816	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I've had one of these stoves for about twenty five years.  I've taken it camping numerous times and it's always worked great.  As long as the new ones are built as good as the older ones then I highly recommend it.
7632	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I like this because it fits my cup holders well. I also don't notice too much taste, although there is a slight metallic taste to the water. I dislike how the finish will chip off the bottom easily.
9625	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These lures are becoming more and more difficult to locate.  I've used for more than 20 years.  In April, I caught a 9 lb 7 oz and a 6lb 8 oz in less than 20 minutes using the perch color Devils Horse / Clark Hill Lake
7924	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Batter up.  Like this at about $2 less than locally. Tho if you wait for the bigchain store to put theirs on clearance, that turns out to be cheaper.
Very clear optics, I really like the different reticles which are very sharp, another very cool thing is the anti-parallax, even if your eye or head moves, the reticle maintains the POI.  the battery life is also very good. Bushnell has a good name in the optics industry because they always stand behind all their products.
update 1/9/17
532	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	As I received this, I started using it. Love the quality of the bands and the different accessories for it. I really bought this to help in my P90x workout and so far so good. Definitely recommended!

If something happens to it, no big deal. To patch a hole, duct tape or tuck tape will work fine if you don't have a real patch.
2378	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Tried various cleaners but this works really well but I am down near water so teak gets a lot of mold. With rough pad it works but needed a fair amount of effort but to be fair my tables were heavily soiled and mold covered. bought the star brite magic pad to use with it. Cut the work by 2/3 and was like magic  Advise getting both to make the job easier.  Used the starbrite teak premium gold and it restored my honey gold finish I like. Had to do the cleaning twice since after first I used Minwax teak oil that was like shellac and attracted mold in 3 weeks. Light color board is done with the cleaner  and  starbrite oil. other was done with minwax teak oil  See attached photo
1033	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This a great work out set.  Comes with guide and the door anchor makes it easy to use.  I am in a wheelchair and the door anchor make it easy for me to set up the resistance point for the exercise.
3670	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Sent a case to my nephew as a "get well" present when he had his tonsils removed. They said he loved em! I've also taken a few of these camping. 99% of the time they are broken, either due to shipping or being lugged around in my backpack...Doesn't really matter though, you eat it like chips, not a candy bar anyway. Great treat when camping. Also nice to store for emergencies.
2405	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Arrived as described.  Once organized, installation was straight forward. The product is a great size, but very light.  That could be good for some.  My biggest complaint is the net is too big.  The balls / pucks get tangled and difficult to get out.  I tie back excess and it works well.
726	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	OVER THE TOP WELL DONE
4323	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	Me and my husband bought these covers and they suck. They are squishy but it still leaves your butt very sore after you ride your bike. Neither of us are overweight. We put these on our Schwinn bicycles. Neither of us like this cover at all.
There are a lot of reviews here on Amazon complaining that the bands eventually wear-out or break.  They are supposed to.  They stretch and, after repeated stretching, yes, they will wear out.  Good.  That means you are using them and your muscles are getting a workout.  Quit whining.  Buy a few more replacement bands.  Wear them out too.
9632	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	great fit vary easy to install
1688	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Easy to put together and helpful to have the colored tabs indicating the top & bottom of the net.  Minus 1-star because I can already tell that the velcro strap that hold the net on are doing to ware very quickly, but it's an easy fix to buy new ones.

2746	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	What an incredible bargain!  We are avid boaters and have a large motor yacht and an inflatable tender with an outboard engine.  That said, we end up using this to get to shore more often.  It is easy and quick to inflate.  One adult and a kid or an adult and a dog can ride easily.  Rowing is no issue at all.  We have even rowed in to shore from a half mile out against the tide.  No issues at all.  The best part is that it collapses down to almost nothing.  Smaller than a fender.  We use an electric inflater, so I can't comment on the supplied pump.
Google and a printer solves that problem.

2210	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My wife bought these for me as a wedding present 33 years ago, and they sit by our back window ready to catch any bird-watching to be had.  They may not get daily use, but darn near it.  We've had these on trips to the mountains and oceans and everywhere in between.  Granted, they aren't the same quality of a $1,000 pair, but really, unless you are spotting elk at twilight, can you really justify that price difference?  Some people like their expensive new toys, I'm a sucker for fly rods, but as far as a basic necessity that is decent quality and will last a long time, these binoculars are hard to beat.
When folded up it takes up a lot less space than my 4inch self inflatable mattress.  I probably would not take it hiking because of the weight but might if I had nothing else.  My 4 inch is just as heavy.

I wish it were made of a thicker gauge metal, but it is still a sturdy stove. If you buy the standard two burner stove, I think you will be disappointed.
This folds so very easily - the 5 yo could do it. It is sturdy and rides pretty well. The brake works quite well too. The adjustable handle means that it will be useful even after the kid grows taller.

I wish it had a narrower base to fit any of my car cup holders but I knew that it wasn't a fit when I bought it. The only other thing to consider is that if you fill it from a water cooler then you have to stop and check the level a couple times as it fills up to avoid over/ under filling.

It's true; don't try to convince me otherwise.  It is a good toy because it gets them outside and running and twirling and jumping.  Easy to store, too.
FWIW, I like more magnification than this, but I guess that's my own fault.  Now I know.  I also own the Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 4-12 x 40 which I do prefer, but that's because I like more light and more magnification.

The two arm rest have to be attached, 2 screws each.  Oh yeah the plastic wrap was a nuisance.  All the shiny aluminum had a clear plastic tube over it and they then assembled the chair, so when removing the plastic there are pieces stuck behind all the joints etc.  Required more work then putting the arm rests on .

I thought about buying a little plastic princess scooter for less but ended up choosing this instead and figured she can grow into it.  At 4 years old, it is a bit too loose in the steering for her to manage and scares her a bit.  I think within the next year it will be great though. It is also a bit too high for her (she is on the shorter side for her age).  Overall it is a great scooter and I would recommend... just depends on the childs ability and size.

For the record, I'm not a fan of things made in China, but this product could not be made any better anywhere else in the world. Everything about it is first class and works to perfection. I own several Compasses made by the best eg; Silva and Suunto etc: and none are better made than this Brunton 15 I just recieved. Believe it or not the one complaint I have is, they placed a sticker announcing 5 free topo maps, on the mirror and it's a bitch to get the sticker and glue off the mirror! Stupid! Another thing, the sighting line on the mirror could be a little bolder, it's too light. This compass is dead-on accurate and tightly put together. Could not be made any better, anywhere!
6361	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is by far the best frisbee I've ever played with!!!  I am in love with this frisbee lol.  I am a terrible thrower with traditional frisbees but this Aerobie Pro Ring makes me look highly skilled.  It is way easier to throw than a normal frisbee and takes a lot less force to throw it as well.  I got the random color option and ended up with bright pink.  Although it was the color I didn't want out of the 3 options, it looks pretty nice in person and I don't mind having it.  All three color options are bright and makes them easy to spot and find.  I hope I don't lose this frisbee or have it break any time soon, but if that does happen then I'll get another for sure.  I also got the Aerobie boomerang in red and the red is very nice looking (and just what I wanted).
I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)

Even better, the handle height is easily adjustable, the thing can be folded flat for those times when you are out and about and your kid loses interest and you end up carrying the scooter, it rolls nicely, it has a brake, and it is light-weight. The latter, in particular, seems to make riding it very enjoyable for my daughter. It's easy, it's fast. It's also small enough that it can be ridden inside the house.

635	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	1.0	I got these to replace my Bodylastics (BL) which I purchased from Amazon in 2010.  The Black Mountain set is 1/3 the price of my BL set, but the hardware is not as robust.  In addition, these bands are rated a lot higher in resistance weight than the BL.  In the BL set, I used the 8 lb band for arm exercises.  With this set I use the 25-30 lb band.  Feels the same.  So if you really want a resistant band for some more strenuous exercise, these are probably not for you.  You can double up on bands if you like, but that's not the point.  The BL had two attachments which allowed you to secure the band to a closed door and pull against it.  Very good for traveling.  This one requires hardware that needs to be mounted if you are going to use them in such a fashion.  The 25-30 lb band I use provides for smooth, not jerky motion.  I like that.  This has a lifetime warranty.  We'll see.

It's rare you find a product that is of incredibly high quality and yet still affordable.

I was right.  This one weighs in a about 45oz and is much easier to inflate. (The air flow of the other one is restricted between air chambers.)

6286	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I used the Fox 40 Classic for many years as a lifeguard.  You do need to be very "deliberate" when blowing the whistle, but once you get used to it, this shouldn't be an issue.  If it's any indication of how loud this whistle is, I actually made my own ears ring many times because I blew too hard.  I could also hear a coworker's whistle from almost a mile away over all the ambient noise.  When I changed jobs and the lifeguards were given metal pea-type whistles to use (those are a joke, by the way), I continued to use a very old, very chewed up Fox 40.  There's never a "pea" getting stuck in the chamber, and no part of the whistle itself can rust like a metal whistle.  Also - because of the plastic construction, you can run this thing through the dishwasher without a problem.  And, if I'm not mistaken, the Fox 40 will float if dropped in water.  The only real 'con' is that you can actually chew the end right off if you use it enough.  Even though my waterfront days are (mostly) behind me, I'm restocking my stash of Fox 40s for emergency use!

Turns out, they not only work but they don't really hurt when you try to catch them, and you can easily throw two at once. Also, sometimes the boomerang comes back and lands softly like a "UFO" when the wind is right and with enough spin. When this happens it looks like a circular hole in the middle when looking up at it, and you can just stick your arm in there to catch it if you can't otherwise or just for more fun. When throwing two at once, all you need to do is grip a little tighter and "spoon" them together and they usually stick within 10 feet of each other. These are not too difficult to learn, I was able to in just a couple hours of practice with no instruction or tips other than what's printed on top of each one.

If you expect to get a good sturdy mat like Everlast used to make, this mat is NOT it! I guess they just don't make them like the older version. The original Everlast mats weren't made of sponge.

1582	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	This works well.  My daughter loves to shoot goals to this net.  I like the size because it gives her a small target and the balls return.  Keep in mind the ball does not return directly to the player.  The ball wildly return to different locations based on the speed and angle of the strike but it is much better than walking up to the net to collect balls.  It also serves to provide practice stopping and controlling a passed ball in open field.  I would have rated it 5 stars if the stakes provided worked well.  The stakes are necassary to hold the net frame firm in the ground and only work for about 10 shots before having to reset the stakes.  I used my tent stakes and rope to secure the net frame to the ground permanently.

First, I should probably make the distinction that this is a TACTICAL knife, not a FIGHTING knife. If you want a knife designed with fighting in mind, look at Gerber/Applegate's Covert folders, or Cold Steel's Ti-Lite. This knife was designed more for law enforcement than an assassin. As other reviewers have mentioned, the shark-tooth tip was a genius idea and perfect for punching into boxes and tough plastic packages before cutting. There's no doubt in my mind that you could do some serious damage to the human body with it, but its thicker Zytel handle and wider, thicker blade seem designed more for wood, rope, plastic, etc., all of which it handles very well.

6863	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	I bought two for a week long camping trip in the desert. Unfortunately one them tore a hole when placing it in the cooler (rubbed against the hinge of the cooler lid). It didn't take too much to scuff a hole, then it just deflated from there. Had to survive the week with half of the water. The other one worked well, although knowing it is somewhat fragile, I was very careful with it. Probably great for many uses, but mine wasn't very durable.
2351	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great knife.  I think it's skirting the lines of legality in my state because you can flip it open, but it's not a "gravity knife" -- it holds itself closed and it has a locking mechanism to hold the blade open, so it seems to fit within the letter of the law.

I was extremely surprised by how comfortable this was! I am a very large man and I expected to be feeling the ground. I didn't. I have extremely healthy lungs and it took me about 5 minutes of pretty much constant puffing to get it fully inflated. Because of the type of valve used, taking the air out takes at least as long as getting the air in. For the price point, I'm thrilled with it.
3788	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Well made board.  Love the rotating number ring (to even out board wear) and the quality of the construction.  Backing board is high density fiber board supporting the sisal face.  Nice color saturation and contrast.  The darts that came with it are even better quality than I had expected.  (Although they could have included o-rings to keep the shafts from un-screwing from the barrel).  All in all an excellent deal.
3488	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Didn't buy these for playing, but for the dryer.  I just toss them in when drying my clothes.
7450	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	My 9 year old son loves this scooter!  He rides it in our unfinished basement and also uses it when I go for walks.  I will be buying one for my 4 year old soon as well, since she likes her brother's scooter too!
15	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Arrived in tact and as expected
Comfortable and standing up to the ramps so far.
1824	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Heavy duty, thick, it's a very good set of bases.  If you leave them outside for too many months they seem to fall apart.
5263	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought two pairs and was not let down.

1229	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	Great bands.  As a free weight lifter myself 5 days a week I needed something to take with me traveling.

3734	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is seriously worth every dollar! Its incredibly powerful and holds a really good charge! Plus, it's really portable... can't beat busting this out while you camp or when you have visitors to only fill the mattress in a few minutes. It's either that or hand pump a mattress for 30 minutes, your choice!
6535	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	These are a lot of fun, work very well, and kids love them.  They are lighter weight so sail well and won't break anything they hit.
9663	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This line really surprised me, it is very strong and tough. I used it in saltwater and highly recommed it.
498	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	The husband and I have been using these for a month now and they are holding up well.  Easy to use and the straps are strong.  I took off one star for the carabiner-style clips that attach the band to the handles.  They have sharp metal bits around the hinge area and anywhere the metal is cut - as if they weren't polished or finished properly.  They cut my finger tips every time I change bands and have to be careful not to touch anywhere near the cut metal.  I imagine if they used better quality carabiners, the price would go up dramatically since the metal is probably the most expensive component of this set, so for what it is, I'm pleased with this brand.  It's a good value for everything you get.

1477	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Just as I remember from my childhood.  Board and rings are great.  Instead of small cues, they are just dowel rods like from the hardware store...not tapered like a cue.  I can get my grandkids to leave their electronics (for a while) to play against me.  If you haven't played it, it's like many variations on pool.  But instead of rolling balls you have sliding rings.  Teaches the fundamentals of bank-shots.  Can play many other games like checkers.  Flip the board over for a different setup.  Sits on a card table.  Easy setup and take down.
7458	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought this scooter for my 5 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  I was concerned that she wasn't ready for one as she is very petite but she scoots all over the place with it.  :-)
5765	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I thought they will be too big for my 6 year old son. The pads are actually good quality and fit well. They would also fit to the kids older than 6 years old.
By the by, because it's molded plastic, you don't want to attach this to a keychain. the split ring will rub right through it and wear a hole through in time swaying back and forth. Be sure to use a string or cord lanyard instead!
2464	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This shipped quickly and is well worth the money!  My grandsons rode the waves at the beach and had the best time in it!  It endured flips and rough treatment!  Great fun for them, ages 12 & 9!
9886	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	item works perfect, as expected.

I used to be a firefighter decades ago, cutting line in California and I wish I had something so well made for the price at that time. It would've been a nice device to have.
9579	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Great lure thank you
1256	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	There just isn't any application not covered with this kit.
1073	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information, but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor, just the handles.
7339	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Bought from the Amazon outlet- as described, very good condition.
4786	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	I had one of these many years ago, hardly ever used it and sold it at a garage sale.  Now that we have a motor home my wife wanted another one so she could cook outside and not get grease inside on the walls whenever she fried food.  It works great just like the last one we owned.
The product is adequate for what it is intended for. It has more features than I was hoping for when I bought it. Installation is easy. Learning to use it is a little bit challenge due to the poor manual, but you'll quickly figure it out.
Very happy with this net so far.
452	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Really cool bands it's cool to how you can hook up more then one to increase the band weight. They also come with a door piece as well should you want to not have to use your feet.
5276	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	NEG	2.0	eye cups too close together and not easy to adjust like older versions.  Seems softer or less quality materials than the goggles I have had for 15 years that needed replacing
5588	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Received in a timely manner. Very happy with product. My son is years old & 140 lbs & these fit just fine!
4754	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I love our Two-Burner stove. We've owned one for 20 years and have never had any issues with it. It works great at our seasonal campsite, as well as canoe trips. At around 10-12 pounds, it's a bit heavy for portaging, but it folds flat and doesn't take up too much space in a pack.
The kids love playing and it is a lot of fun.  One minor drawback is that the two-piece pole does 'wobble' a bit between the two sections and within the sleeve.  But it's not that noticeable and does not detract from the fun.  The ball is pretty hard when inflated to the recommended pressure, would hurt if hit in the head, etc.
9356	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	4.0	I ordered large and have 34 inch waist. Standing up straight,  It is a bit loose in the behind. Mind you the design of threading is curved, so when I sit forward on my bike in good low riding position, the fit is proper. legs are perfect and has flat drawstring to adjustments. Pad is comfortable on 25K plus rides. good shorts for money.
4953	Sports_and_Outdoors_5	POS	5.0	Good buy
