All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.

My excuse? My earbuds broke and I picked up a cheap replacement on the road (not via Amazon), just to tide me over. And, yeah, they are as terrible as the reviews here state. I'm astonished they're still for sale, they're so bad.

4656	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I was having a lot of problems with my CD player skipping, refusing to play certain CDs, and randomly changing CDs. I thought I would have to replace it, which I didn't want to because it's a high-end one, and I just love the sound quality. In the process of shopping for a new player, I came across information on CD lens cleaners. People were saying that they saved their CD player. Well, it's true! Don't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens, it wasn't broken.
4823	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	If you buy this product after looking at these reviews, you have only yourself to blame.
In use, the quick focus mechanism is actually very effective but definitely requires two hands to operate as it's a little stiff (and as a lever, you have to be able to press down on either side). I guess few people would be operating something this heavy with one hand, but it does mean that both hands are under tension as you have to have fingers on the  focus mechanism.
One of the DB9F connectors was a little too tight and the label was pealing off.
My one complaint is that it has two very little rubber pads on the bottom.  That means the designers thought of slide resistance (like when the radio sits on something made of porcelan) but they didn't do enough to prevent it.  This radio needs big high-traction rubber pads on the bottom, and then it would be perfect.
5866	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	They worked great!
6339	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	What can you say, it is a CAT5 cable, has quality molded connectors, works, and was cheap. I carry 2-3 with me on trips to plug into the connections at my hotel in various lengths, and Belkin always delivers with quality cables.

6214	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack arrived on time and in good condition.  It is very hard to find VHS in retail stores, but I am glad these tapes can be found here at Amazon and other websites as well.  These can record up to 8 hours.  I have a VHS tape eraser, which is a giant magnet, so when after viewing my recorded program I erase them to record another program.  Very durable.  Can be reused over and over again, best when you erase with the tape eraser, otherwise you will see your old program under your new program.  I recommend this product.  I rate this a 5 star.

The quality of these labels is actually better than the tape cartridge that came standard with the labelmaker.
My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.

3)  Nice, full sound from the internal speaker.

Sharp resolution, useful utilities, convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen. Lightweight, durable and well designed.

Nice way to rip off your customers and get rid of old stock.
283	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I've used Windows for years and wanted this book so I could use my son's Macbook Pro on occasion - when he lets me.  I've been intrigued with Macs since my kids first got on them in their elementary schools.  I've always found them more user friendly and certainly sturdier for kid use than PCs. The only thing that stops me from taking the plunge and buying one is that the software I use for work is only for PCs.  (Since reading this book, I've discovered there are ways around that issue.)


9614	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Thanks
I too thought I was buying a USB cable that I could connect two computers.  I believed this because it is an "A/A" extension cable.  Indeed, the key word is "extension."  Normally, "A/A" would mean the same type of connector but not in this case.
8714	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	What can I say about this product, fair price and gets job done.  Seems to outlast competition with repeated use.
8099	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	The pink cable was like $1 when I bought it, so you really can't beat the price. Its a pretty standard cable and it works just fine. The connectors are pretty good, the only negative I have is the little plastic guards that protect the tab on the connector are fragile; if you push them sideways very much they come right off. But honestly you don't need those ( they can even be annoying in tight spaces), and for $1 the quality can't be beat!
This low profile connector is working perfect in combination with my USB RS-232 cable.
i recommend it
Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.
1430	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is good product compared to its price. I'm using it for watching video, writing documents, and web searching. It's perfect for my needs, and I upload CM 1.0, so now I'm using it with Android... It's so good. :-)
Its got a scan feature which I use from time to time the red button goes to channel 9 (for emergencies), or if you press it again it goes to channel 19. The volume and squelch knobs are on top, and the PTT button and channel up/down buttons are on the left side. There is also a button that you can press that'll light up the screen for a minute.
1871	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	With the lowering cost of the Nook Simple Touch (now that the Glow Light is available), I decided that it was time to snatch one up.

The quality of these labels is actually better than the tape cartridge that came standard with the labelmaker.
The instructions are very well written and provide good graphical representations. The arm is easy to mount to the wall, and to the monitor/T.V.. Compacts well to the wall when pushed all the way in, and extends easily when I want to move the Monitor out and around.

1144	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Slow to load pages compared to all the other tablets in our household My main problem is B&N told me we could use gift cards to buy ebooks without adding a credit card to the account and that was very important since it was going to my youngest daughter and I didn't want her accidently buying books on credit. YOU CAN NOT BUY BOOKS WITHOUT ADDING A CREDIT CARD TO YOUR ACCOUNT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE B&N GIFT CARD CREDIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT. Online customer service told me the store would refund my gift card I went to the local store where I purchased the nook and gift card , they would not refund my gift card. So for $20 they get this negative review and lost a customer for life since they lied to me twice.

5288	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Bought these for a long airplane ride. They worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out. That seems to be pretty common with this set. Also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side.
9670	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Orderd the wrong one, my fault.
The fold-up clip has been most functional for me as a stand so that I can set it standing on it's side, directed toward my Kindle while lying on my side to read.

It still gives you quality & integrity with each and every product.

3186	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	it wasn't as easy to install as I thought. I wanted something easy and quick to install. Not because I'm not tech savy but because I didn't want to mess with this printer, instead I had to and still have to do some trouble shooting to try ti figure out why my printer doesn't work. I might have given up before I even tried but like I said , I wanted something quick I could plug and play and this was not one of them .
7742	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This works well on a conference table, like for class sessions with multiple laptops. Will hold 6 of the larger powersupply type plugs if needed. These come in handy. Functional as well as attractive with the different colors. The color scheme allows instant identification of cables with stickers that come with it.
4775	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works fine.  But need to rewind this tape cleaner before each use.  Does not have an automatic rewind for my VCR.
If you're not hearing anything, try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side. In my Rav4, cassettes load by inserting the narrow end. But since I didn't hear any audio, I thought this adaptor was broken. It turned out that if I made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette, then there was no problem.

I've bought Maxell products in the past(especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes) and have never been disappointed. The color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes. I know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the 8-track (and I'm trying to slowly make the change over to digital media) but in the meanwhile..I can highly recommend this Maxell 4-pk for your vcr recording needs.

8384	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works great on my daughter's Yamaha. Came with an adapter and it fits perfectly and she can practice while the boys are watching tv and nobody gets annoyed at the other now
1218	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)  All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add "epub download" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.

1490	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.
4. They are white, like every other earbuds available on the market today. I wasn't plugging these into an IPod, but now I look all the yuppies on the bus out of suburbia with their white wires going into their ears.

526	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.
I read many other reviews before purchasing, so had no trouble getting the card to work properly. I popped it in without copying any data to it, the used the phone's settings manager to format it. Then I copied all the data from the previous card. Works perfectly, double the space.

6891	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,
4) Like most other plug strips, there are slots on the back to allow it to be mounted on a wall, the side of a desk or on the bottom of a shelf.

There's no such issue with the digital CD lens cleaner. This disk has some encoded voice commands and about a dozen little brushes the protrude about 1/8 of an inch from the surface of the disk. I guess the disk spins and the brushes rub off the bad stuff from the CD lens. If there's another explanation, I'd like to hear it. It works every time.

Overall, Maxell Xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
5652	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	these work for just about anything that you might need them for.  there are only six in the package so you don't get very many.

Its nice it supports USB 2.0 and 10/100 Ethernet.  The print server is connected to a gigabit network cable, and port light shows it connects at 100Mbps.  For home use, the server is faster than most any home printer, and even most Laser printers, so it is not going to be a bottleneck in your system.
Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.
1171	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Kind of felt bad buying the competitors product on Amazon, but it's a great little device. Without the backlight, the battery lasts forever!

My only kvetch with the book is that this detail and thoroughness does come with a price: this is a dry read and there wasn't much effort to inject humor or entertainment. So if you like humor in your computer books check out David Pogue.
Now just a few things...the Nook First Edition lets you more dynamically play with fonts whereas this one has preset font size options but that's still quite alright..but > this < one lets you highlight a word and it has a dictionary right there for you !
3014	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this external drive to work with my daughters ASUS windows 8.1 laptop.
2783	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I click and its not powered upon opening the package. Okay so there was no indicator stating charged. I charge for 5 hours via USB and see a nice blue light emitted from above bulbs. I click button and it works while connected to laptop/desktop. I remove to use on book and click, I click, I click, I slam, I punch, I bash, I throw across the room and still get no light. I reconnect to laptop/desktop USB and see a lovely blue charge light which generally indicates done charging. I push button and it lights. I remove and push button but nothing happens. I throw in the trash and consider myself lucky this was only a 20 dollar set back. How disappointed I am.
Regardless of this, there were other limitations.  Overall this seemed to focus on accomplishing very basic tasks - common to all computers, Mac or PC - which Mac does so intuitively that I'm surprised this was the focus of the book.  I was looking for information on very specific Mac-things, such as Time Machine, how security works specifically on a Mac (i.e., no virus software), keyboard differences and shortcuts.  That sort of thing.  Mac has a lot of these, some of which are not immediately apparent to a former PC user, and I was frustrated by this lack.
As mst people stated, battery/circuit weight on left ear piece can break wire and make them useless.

The Might Bright is better in all regards, and is worth the $10 it cost me.
I think the Sharp 722 is the best Minidisc in the price  range because of the lengthy battery life and the small, squarish shape.  The remote can be useful, and the jogwheel makes functions such as adding  and deleting tracks intuitive.  It comes with a digital cable, which is a  must-buy for other recorders that don't come with one.

Finally, kudos to Amazon to allow comments on competitor products. I did not see place on BN.com to comment on Nook. this means a much more interactive shopping experience on Amazon.

4318	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have bought a few of these in the past, this one is holding up well, the seller ships fast, I would order from them again, I would also recommend

1228	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!  It arrived very quickly and in great shape.
4653	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It works fine and is a pretty good product.  I picked this one over 4 other ones because it was cheaper and had okay reviews.  It does the job well.

3054	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed to download some programs that weren't available on line, so I purchased this USB and used my own disks.  Worked very well, it is almost a necessity for those notebooks that do not have a dvd drive included.
8321	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	These have never failed me, and play music and computer sounds just fine.  They are easy to hook up, I recomend them.
4321	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Excellent
To avoid finding the radio with dead batteries (or worse, corrosion in the battery compartment), I set reminders in my Palm to change various batteries annually.
6908	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have bought multiple of these. They are great to extend a phone charger. I have them on all of my chargers. They have aged well also!
1. They are uncomfortable in my ear. No soft rubber, just hard plastic. Not even really molded to fit in an ear.
The reception is great, on AM and FM I live in the DC metro area and can tune AM stations in NY and Chicago with ease.
I was without my HP Laserjet 4050 for about a week until I came across a Belkin network USB hub which I scarfed up for only $10 (selling for $99 on Belkin's web site!) and found the software and plugged it in. Worked great with my small home network.
4691	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I`m a musician and I record almost everyday . These tapes is an excelent way to check my self. Very clean recordings and excelent playback. Good tapes
the instructions and in less than a minute everything was working like new.  Great product.
And why not?  This "older" product is the most current product  available by them to date.  And it's not like after shelling out $275 for a  unit,  you're willing to "upgrade" to another player in 6  months!

Long battery life (50hrs)
8952	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This product works flawlessly and provides a great signal for my extended network system. I highly recommend this cable.
7818	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for use on my desktop. The shape makes it very convenient for use with power cords and the odd shaped transformer packs for cell phones, hard drives etc. The power switch on top is convenient if you want to shut it off to avoid wasting energy on the plugged in items when not in use. Nice long power cord, heavy base keeps it from moving around to much. Highly recommended.

The only problem (minus 1 star) is that things have moved on since the book was published. So where the book states that the Chrome OS has no PC-like "desktop", it does now. And where the book describes the "four" Chromebook models (correct at the time of publishing), there are now some newer models such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samsung-Chromebook-Wi-Fi-11-6-Inch/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samsung-Series-3-Chromebox/dp/B007Y8DJEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samsung Series 3 Chromebox</a>. And where the book suggests that the Chrome file manager doesn't allow you to copy files from one location to another... well, now it does. You get the idea.
Reception is likewise incredibly impressive. Listening to AM at night is a real trip, literally. This is one of the reasons that there is no digital tuning on this model. A dial setup will pull in stations much better than a typical digital tuner will. "Digital" is not always best.
Hondo.
Cant beat the price
1666	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	When looking for some new author's to read, I ran across some consistently high Amazon reviews for author Stephen Leather ( http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Leather/e/B000APS0ZM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 ).  Not wanting to jump into one of his longer running series, I picked up Nightfall which is the first of a trilogy of books based around Jack Nightingale (yeah, I know, not very subtle).  So with the character name setting a bad start, I grudgingly proceeded to read the book fearing I had stuck myself with some genre sludge written to tap the exploding reader interest in this area.  And in the blink of an eye, fifty pages had passed and I was hooked.  Huh, I didn't see that coming.
9936	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Product fit my machine as disclosed in the description.  This is the first time I have had to refill the tape in this machine, which I have owned for several years.  It was wonderful to find the refills on Amazon and at a great price.
- Won't fit standard Moleskine reporter books, even the soft cover ones (too rigid backing, too thick)
8528	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great
3637	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works fine.
12/17/2015 Update - I still have both original monitors.  They are both working fine.  I have had the problem where one or both monitors blanks out and is not recognized by Windows 10 several times, but it hasn't happened in quite a while. I have done several voodoo combinations of button pushing, cable swapping and graphics driver reloading. I am not 100% sure, but I think I may be on to something.  The last time it happened, I powered down the PC, unplugged the power source from the back of the monitor (and probably from the AC source too, don't remember), let it sit for 15 minutes, plugged it back in, powered on PC and voila!  I am not 100% sure that I didn't do any button pushing or other voodoo.
This cable works like a charm and well worth the price at 50ft length.
8185	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I actually ordered this Belkin Ethernet cable for it's certified status and did receive a new (packaged) Belkin Ethernet cable. Plus, the price was the lowest I've found for this brand name cable. Of course, it's working fine. It's manufacture and durability appear among the best. Don't get me wrong, I use and am happy with the generics too...only difference seems to be the thicker construction of this Belkin brand. I expect unparalleled performance and longevity from this cable.
It arrived in two days and fits my Lumix DMC-ZS15. Photos and video look great on my flat screen TV. So it does what I want, but appears a bit different from the photo.
To boot, the price is dead on!  $139 with Wifi.  If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!
1550	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for my mom for Christmas 2013, I luckily have a job and am in college so I did have a little extra money to give my parents something special this Christmas. I mom kept mentioning the Nook GlowLight and I ended up buying a used version from Unclaimed Baggage (Shout Out!) she loves it very much, my mom is 53 and got used to the touch screen very quickly, she has a 4 page library of Nook Books today.
7523	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	good power strip
5649	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	My MacBook Pro plays CDs just fine, but when you insert a DVD the laptop will churn on the disc for a few seconds and then spit it out.  The same thing happened with this lens cleaner.  Weak.
The only negative I can think of is that the aforementioned "black ice" scented tree air fresheners are rendered useless by the activated charcoal. I loved those air fresheners, but it's not a big deal. The activated charcoal works so much better (night and day difference), so that's the one I'll be sticking with.
Would def buy again
7243	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Matched our set and was a great price.
7224	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Cheap enough but you get what you pay for. The cable is too thin and caused ghosting on my monitor!
6546	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	fixed my leak with it
The hammerhead light has a brighter light than the 2 duet light with both lights on.  I plan to use all 3 on my easel to obtain the light I need.
6688	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I love these things. I have like seven of them and use them for everything. mouse for my computer, charger cords. wired xbox controllers for playing emulators on the computer. great quality.
1883	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This cover is so well engineered it is very difficult to find a negative. Good looking, smart, sleek, magnet closures are brilliant!! You will not want to put your Nook down! I ordered this for under $10.00 but I would have gladly paid full retail at $30.00!!
2491	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased two of these and they had a very short life.  Would not recommend.
3704	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	works in my dash-cam just fine!
3778	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	paid 3 dollars for this cant go past the est bargain and it works amazingly
9556	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	nice product and great deal
4543	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works as intended. No issues using it. Now I can listen to my audio books in my commuter car. :)
9078	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Nice DVD cleaner
For the price, and for the built-in rechargable batteries, these are an excellent deal in my opinion, and I've enjoyed having them and using them, and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and I both can use them to watch movies with explosions and/or loud orchestral soundtracks late at night.
635	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Didn't think it would work as well as it has,
5609	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	These work and look exactly as expected.  Easy to use.  What more can I say about Velcro strips? Evidently I need to say more to meet the minimum word requirement to post this review.
3839	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The mini side came unclipped from the plastic and fell off exposing the wire pins. It started to wiggle and give after about the fourth time it was used.
N: 149 with wifi
There is a better radio available from  Motorola called the "TalkAbout Distance", which is much more  expensive, and requires a license to use.  The TalkAbout 250 is not the top  of the line TalkAbout, but will be great for most peoples needs.
1370	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Does not accept apps from outside vendors.  Useless.  Got as a present, I am trying to figure out how to get rid of it
Ms. Miles plays with words like a virtuoso, buy a box of tissues for the most endearing parts...

3351	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Ordered this replacement card.  My original cratered on me.  No problems with software....worked perfect.
1. The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N support page fixed that.
2479	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	output not sufficient to charge my IPad....... two days and still not 100%....I had to replace it with a more expensive one from the corner drug store.

Generally, if you are shopping for an inexpensive, simple e-reader, I strongly urge you to buy the Nook, and not the Kindle.  I have tried both, and prefer the Nook.
5411	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I've owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless. This unit fits well and the sound quality I hear is superb. I've asked those I've talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear. Guess I'd have to give it a total of five stars.
7980	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	it works great..

I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.
3155	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Purchased for a label printer for my office. It works well. I have had no problems with it.
The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.

550	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	We got this one recently and its a great wall mount. The unit is pretty heavy, so you will need a helper. It also includes a variety of screws to mount also. Our TV documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern. But after putting hte plate over the back, seems we didn't need the extra extenders as its 200x200. This is on a Samsung 40" 5000 series LEDTV.
836	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Not the one we ordered exactly but ill still take it because its still the correct gb. Not sure if it'll be better or not but ill be giving it a try.
8088	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	this cable works and is cheap. the tabs haven't broken off after extensive use, and the rubber shield covering that extends up onto them for the "no snag" feature might be responsible for that, though it seems to be decent quality plastic (not super brittle) on the connector too.
6222	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Glad to have a source for this adapter when using old printers with newer computers.
4631	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This works perfect for hooking up my phone to my old tape player in the car. The cord is probably 4 feet so plenty of room to move and it seems to be quality. Mine does make a slight clicking sound when playing but this could be caused by the car tape player and not he adapter.
mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?
They're great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.
9034	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	worked as advertised.
6618	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great & very good value
8643	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Wallet and Phone in one. Does the phone justice!

I know that every home is different, but it had just enough water pressure to get a good rinse on your hair or body. It wasn't too hard and it wasn't too soft.
4474	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	good product
I first played Think Deck when I was considering a major career change and physical move. Going through the questions pushed me to realize and accept that it was indeed time for me to change my course. The questions are thoughtful and really push you to dig deeper. I like the mix of self reflection and optional sharing. Every time I've played it since,  people say how both helpful and fun it is to play. It's also a great way to get to know people better. Highly recommended!
6434	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I am willing to do start ratings and a word or two fro every purchase.  I am unwilling to title my remarks and being forced to write an arbitrary number of words.
7743	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I'm very satisfied
I'm totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn't be without a couple, especially for travel.
5640	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Cables work well for the function I need

The Maxell UR is not meant for music. You can record your favorite songs but the optimum way to hear the playback is on a cassette that is referred to as Chrome or Position 2. The UR is a normal bias (Position 1). These are used to record voice. It may be advantageous for interviewing somebody, for notes to be transcribed, recording a sporting event and or a talk show from the radio.

I must say right off the bat that I really like these headphones a lot. They fulfill all my requirements when listening to music - comfort, quality, signal range and signal response.  All with one minor caveat (I would give these 4.5 stars if I could).
Here, Jack Nightingale is a struggling London private-eye and a former member of the Metropolitan Police's elite CO19 armed response unit, from which he was forced out under a cloud after a suicide-prevention incident went horribly wrong. During his daily routine of catching-out cheating spouses, Jack now learns that he's been willed a palatial country home by a previously unknown man, Ainsley Gosling, claiming to be Nightingale's biological father. Why, the inheritance tax alone will ruin Jack's finances. And then there's the DVD, made shortly before Gosling blew his brains out with a shotgun, on which he apologizes for selling his son's soul to a devil at birth, the delivery due on Nightingale's thirty-third birthday two weeks hence.
5319	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought a couple of these to take on a long trip in order to make the flights more comfortable. There were three of us, so I also bought one of the more expensive noise canceling headphones too, the Jabra 820S (see my other reviews). The noise canceling feature on the Jabra was definitely better, but the truth is, for airline comfort, the Maxells were enough for us. I usually have a hard time sleeping on a plane, but this time I put on the headphones with the noise cancellation on, inflated one of those headrests pillows that wrap around your neck and put that on, turned on my Mp3 player connected to the headphones, and listened to Schubert's "Ave Maria" repeated over and over at very low volume, passed out, and slept like a baby for hours, so these headphones did the trick for me. I really like how they fold up into a ball very quickly so you can get them out of the way without much hassle and their construction seems quite sturdy. Back home, I stored away the Maxells and use the Jabra with my computer to listen to music, etc.
2109	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this TravelFlex as well as the Mighty Bright Xtraflex 2 LED book light. I liked them both, but I give the edge to the TravelFlex.  Both devices use bright and efficient LED lights.  The light color is a bit blueish (as with all LEDs that I've seen), but both provide plenty of light for reading in the dark (and they double as flashlights in a pinch).  Both devices clip on to the top edge of your book or Kindle and have flexible necks that allow you to position the light in such a way as to illuminate the whole page without glare.
2756	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Tal ves no se encuentre a la altura de G.R.R. Martin en cuanto a intriga y flujo de la historia. En lugar de dejar pistas para que el lector naturalmente llegue a la una conclusi&oacute;n, e autor es muy repetitivo en "recordarle" al lector lo que sucedi&oacute; tanto en vol&uacute;menes como cap&iacute;tulos anteriores y puede llegar a ser tedioso.
So this device can transmit 1 meg in 1/2 a second.
I also recommend you look into audible.com for audio books.  Since the Rio 500 has the ability to save it's files to folders, you'll be able to have a folder with an audio book and have another one with music.  I was never a fan of audiobooks, but I've been won over.  Try it while commuting and you'll see what I mean.
This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens. Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted, so that was the reason I picked this one.
4917	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It worked great for me, but look out the handle on it may break off as it did me. I found out that you really don't need it. The reason I gave it 5 stars is the fact it really works.
With fingers crossed, I plugged the parallel printer adapter and WHOOOPEEE it worked. I couldn't believe it. Takes a bit longer to "think" but well worth it.

7731	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Good product at a great price.  Definitely would buy again.


8700	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Fits my note 3 great....holds credit cards great and fits into a pair of jeans pretty well if you carry your phone in your pocket.

6984	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is a straightforward product.  No problems with the devices I have used; one of which was extending a StarTech 6-Feet USB to parallel printer cable.
1747	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Good and Standard product and the price was good.
4. Best shot selection gives some really interesting flexibility with regard to avail. light photography (OK, so I know I really should use a tripod).
I wish I had purchased 2 so I can use more than one outlet at a time. I did bring along an extension cord, but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate. Using 2 outlets is more efficient. I'm buying an additional one for my next trip.
4257	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	AOK

2445	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Bought a few of these - one has now crapped out
Also the names of the men in the Kindle edition that I read have been changed. Nick is Sean and Sergio is Ian.

8538	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This cable did not work, and is too cheap to send back.  I usually like Belkin products, so I am disappointed, and will probably stop buying Belkin products in the future.  I would think a product like this would be 100% electrically tested, so I am shocked that something of this poor quality made it to a customer.
a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and don't scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.
2818	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great picture and as basic as it gets. We'll see how long it lasts. Love it so far (famous last words)
3894	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Tested this out to connect a MK808 Android stick to my Panasonic plasma TV.  Works fine, no problems I could tell.
4432	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	So far this has worked great. I ordered several since they are getting so hard to find. I've used 2 for recording shows then reused. No problems with them so far. Price was good and so far so good. Won't know how long they last till more time and use has passed. Will update if anything would change.
Thank you very much.
63	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth.  It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages.  Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.

Review:
6767	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I ordered two of these for my wife's new tub  (re-doing bathroom)  She gets a soaking tub, I get a small shower-steam space.... we're all happy.  Anyway, ordered these because they are about the only thing less than 3 inches around.... too big for our hands, especially when slippery.  Ordered the angled and the 24" straight.  They came in just a couple days and feeling it today  I was so pleased with it...... I ordered another for my shower space.  They feel great.... and feel safe too,  box says up to 500 pounds.  Very happy with them
5493	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	works fine
I now use my laptop in the following manner: first, I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit; then I turn on the printer; and finally, I extend the little blue tooth-shaped antenna (how cute!) on the laptop's PC card -- and I'm all set to go!

7947	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	works great, good price
2276	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Purchased these for my children (5 & 2) and they are huge fit myself. Except they aren't sturdy, fall off even my own head. The speakers aren't very loud, also don't think the volume control works on the wire. Not worth the money even if they were cheap. I'd send them back if I could.

6429	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I use this everyday for my Xbox controller to charge it and the cord is usually on the floor and has held up amazingly after 3 years. Not sure if i could break it if i tried. Love it and will buy again.
234	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I was not very impressed with these books, though I have enjoyed previous Heidi Betts novels. It's possible I just don't like a novella length romance - I do not read them often. Also, these three books (especially the first two) were more erotica than romance, which I was not expecting.

Yup I am living in the 80's. I have three vcr's that and still enjoy watching or buying discount vcr movies or old ones I have filmed. And yes, guilty as charged, I still use them to tape shows I have missed. This is a good value for the 4 pack and I tape over them after watching whatever I have taped and so far no issues. I think you can tape over about 30 times before the quality starts dropping
- Browser capability, or lack thereof...biggest dissappointment for me. If they could create a Netbook/E-Reader that was the size of an e-reader, but possessed the "little PC" functionality of a netbook, I would be in heaven. Until they do, I have both. Depending on the Kindle's capability, perhaps this is a strong seller for others out there. But for me, the Nook's other features outweighed not having a web browser capability.

1904	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Protects the device very well,  looks good, stands up a table very well.  I do wish there were 4 securing tabs instead of only two on one side but this goes back to the original designer not feeling they were necessary.  For the money, about $15 it can't be beat.  It was $40 on the Barns and Noble site.
All in all a must for someone who uses their smartphone for what it's worth.
763	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This product is just poor quality. It didn't work most of the time and it seemed that the connection was loose. There's too many things that have to be done to set this thing up. Skip this product.
Yet these binoculars that weigh 12 TIMES as much as my cell phone, with optics that are far more vulnerable to damage from the shocks of shipping and handling than a cell phone have only a couple of ounces of material to protect them from damage and came in a box no sturdier than a cereal box. It is a miracle if any of these binoculars get to the customer in one piece!

Anyway - I use this male to female VGA monitor extension cable to extend another 15' VGA cable which connects my laptop to my 46" LCD TV. I would say I am very discerning when it comes to assessing audio/video quality and still feel the picture is nearly PERFECT. It does what it is supposed to, without any detectable degrading to the image quality or "noise." The build feels solid and at the same time, not too rigid. I am very happy with this product.

2044	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Product arrived properly packaged. Small light weight lamp, total length just under 14 inches. Plugs into any USB port easily, including the dual port type. Once plugged in, the lamp does feel in need of a little more support at the USB port, but so far not a problem. Switch is a simple push to "On/2 LED", push again for "On/1 LED", the push again for "Off". Just enought light for working in a room where someone is asleep, and would not disturb the sleeper. Requires a bit of "inventive" adjusting to get the lamp to light the keyboard but not produce glare off the screen, or area surounding keyboard. I think for the purpose intended, the mighty Brite Dbl LED is well worth the buy.

How 'bout that...
The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has "classes" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.

I bought this 4gb Kingston Micro SD with adapter for a Motorola Moto Q9h (AT&T), and it failed to recognize the Micro SD.  It detected it, and let me know how much memory was there, but it would give me an error and would NOT allow me to save to it, or open the file I had on it.  So, I sent the Moto Q9h back and replaced with a Blackberry Curve 8300, which also stated that it had an expansion slot which would support up to a 2gb Micro SD.  However, I tested it with another Blackberry 8300 model and it worked.

There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these.

What's middling-good: The second UI screen seems a bit odd, and the whole "library" organization could use work. I've gotten used to hierarchical folders-within-folders. It has one level of folders, but still has a largely flat organization. That gets clunky after you load a few dozen books. I'm not nuts about the iffy touchscreen features, either - big fingers and small UIs don't match. I've used only the basic reading and library features, so can't comment on the rest.
My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.

Thanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.
The Kindle 3, from everything I read, was a vast improvement over the Kindle 2.  Not that the K2 was bad, but the K3 just made it all the more better.  Without relisting all the pluses of the K3, I'll just jump to what ruled the K3 out:  No DRM ePub support for my local library.  I want to expound on why this really is important!  At first, I added five books to my queue from Amazon that really interested me.  They were priced reasonably; and had I bought the K3, they would have been purchased too.  Next, I went to [...] and logged in with my library book card.  [...] had three of those eBooks available for free check-out from my library.  Had I bought the K3, none of those local library eBooks could have been checked out because the Kindle is NOT supported by local libraries using DRM ePub.  I'm not talking about all those "free" eBook web sites that let you download classics from 100 years ago. I'm talking about recently released eBooks that can be checked out from your local library for free; my library uses [...] for this service.  DRM ePub books are licensed/restricted for checkout and can't be converted to a Kindle.  As far as the remaining two books that weren't available from the local library for eBook checkout, I priced them between Amazon vs Barnes and Noble.  The B&N eBooks were cheaper, BUT...in all fairness, I've seen it go the other way with other eBooks that where cheaper at Amazon.  In this case, it was in favor of B&N.  Final point against all versions of Kindle:  The mechanical keyboard hanging off the bottom.  While not distracting from reading books, and somewhat useful for the rare task outside of reading eBooks, it gives them the look of an oversized calculator and not an electronic book.  Of course, this is purely aesthetic; and to some isn't an issue.  When compared to a Nook, it does stands out.

2778	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.
Summary:
- Easy to use interface.
3845	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It does exactly what it is supposed to do and how could anyone complain at the price?  Get one, you'll LOVE IT !
5187	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom. Because of old wiring in the house, the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available. While I use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room, I needed a phone jack so my Tivo could dial out and get programming information. When set up, the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them. I purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that I could use it almost anywhere in my house. After a lot of effort, I find the unit to be nearly worthless.
If I had to do it over again, I would still buy the Belkin 50 footers. I don't want to have a 500 foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around.
Pros: lightweight, small, simple, holds hundreds of books, only needs a charge 1-2x month, you can create shelves with books of your choosing.
The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.
This is a ridiculous, useless system and should be improved or completely eliminated because it does more harm than good.... I certainly can't get anything useful out of it.
Works great in computer cases for cable dressing.

These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it's only $2.

I had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a ZIP drive, but it seems to work about the same  speed as an ATAPI drive I had preinstalled on my PII 400Mhz. The price is  right for ZIP drives. Don't bother with the 250 MB drive - disks are more  and not enough people have the drives yet that support them.

I think the folks at Nikon have a great camera  here but need to work on making it more cost effective and user friendly.  To bring the camera up to speed a minimum of another $200+ would have to be  invested. (Batteries, charger and larger flash card) The PC hook-up could  be greatly improved and made more user friendly.  Considering the already  high cost this is not yet a good package. I was sorry to return it.
I was pleasantly surprised when I didn't have to do anything except make sure up front that my network connections work fine. I connected the printer to the print server, powered up the print server, and then put NetGear's installation CD into my PC.

6831	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This USB extension cable works as described.  One end of the cable has a female USB adopter to accept a regular male USB connector.
I gave this 4.5 stars instead of 5 because I found at least 5 typos in the book were words were omitted from a sentence and in one case transposed in a sentence.  For a debut novel this is minor, as my own traditionally published first book had 7 typos.  When I brought this to the attention of my publisher the comeback was, "Patricia Cornwell's new book has 28 typos in it."  My comeback was, "I'm not Patricia Cornwell."  As authors we have a responsibility to our readers.  As self-published authors that responsibility, in my humble opinion, increases.
Overall it is a really nice unit, solidly built. You'll need a bigger memory card, probably a USB card reader and NIMH batterys (don't let them sell you NICADS - get the 1500mah NIMH along with a 1 hour rapid charger).

3823	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	This HDMI cable is VERY low quality and not reliable.  After receiving this cable, i used it to connect my DSLR to a TV and noticed instantly the artifacts in the image caused by the cable.  Colour was messed up and the image was flickering.  The next time i tested it, it did not work at all.  My other name-brand HDMI cables do not have any issues.  The seller gave me a refund, but still, save you time and buy one from a known brand.

2698	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I bought this for a friend who's having a tough time right now and loves anything with Hello Kitty on it.  She loved it and said it was very cute and surpiringly well made for the price.  Be warned though.  She said it arrived in an ordinary envelope and she almost threw it away thinking it was some sort of junk mail.  But she decided to check and make sure and discovered the necklace.  I had told her it was coming and she had forgotten.  So if you order this, don't forget you did and throw it away!
The sub-woofer seems fine, but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the Creative Labs Speakers.  For gaming they sound fine, but music clearly sounds better on the Creative Labs speakers to me.

5561	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	They're little velcro straps.  Not much to say here, they work exactly as you'd think they would and do a great job of keeping cables organized.
I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.
1863	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this book for my 16-yr-old daughter who is interested in becoming a programmer. The book focuses on the concepts, not how to write a "Hello, World" program in any particular programming language. That's a good thing. As she moves on into specific languages, it makes it easier to learn the specific syntax of a language if you already have an understanding of the nature of strings, arrays, loops, logical arguments, files, etc.

5455	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I ordered this cable from Sewell Direct. I received the cable in generic form. It was not packaged by Belkin. It did not say Belkin on the cable itself. It came in a plain plastic bag. My cable at home has Belkin imprinted on it, enclosed in Belkin packaging. I returned it to Sewell. They promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs. They should specify this generic or bulk packaging, so that I do not waste my time ordering from them.
The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.

2086	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	excellent, light weight book light with good adjustability.  I gave it 4 stars because it's almost TOO bright and sometimes bothers my husband when he's trying to sleep in the same bed next to me.  I ordered the Kotek led lamp next because it has 3 settings AND a USB charger.  But it's bigger than the Mighty bright and a bit heavier as well.  So the MB will be packed when I travel.  Both good little lamps.
I was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive. Truly amazing. All peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to use.
I promoted my Nook readers to friends until this firmware update, because of the OK hardware and epub support. However, considering that B&N is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device. It is OK if given free for a brand new unit.
4230	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great product and high capacity - problem is with and SDHC memory check your devices if they are compatiable.  I didn't realize all the card readers I have do not support SDHC - very frustrating.
9356	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works just fine, good price.
First off, it's just TOO DARN BRIGHT.  This lights up the entire room and keeps anyone who may be sleeping near you awake.  The lights aren't directional, so they just glow brightly and spill light everywhere.  There's no dimmer, so the ultra-bright LEDs make it like daytime wherever you are.  Not appropriate at all for travel on a bus or plane.
Cons
All in all: A fine little radio esp. for the $. Quite good sound with the speaker,and very very good through phones. Good MW/Am dx( not a 2010 or RF-2200 but,still a lot better than you might think).Good with just the whip ant. for SW.Very good FM.I think it's by far the best radio you can get for the money....grab one while you can still get a new one....8)
884	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I use this for my Group Pro Hero 4 Silver. It can hold over 2 hours of video on a high setting. This is way cheaper than any retail store so don't get fooled into paying triple the cost! At this price get two especially if you have more than one battery.
This is my first GPS unit. It's very acurate, I've been using it for Geocaching and it's helped me locate several caches I would have not seen without such good acuracy, even under heavy tree cover.

8826	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Beauty is deceiving. The worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on/off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach. Get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick. Keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best, and confusing to use. The plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion. Thousands of these must be sitting in drawers, silenced by the elements! Junk...that's why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers.

978	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I've bought 4 after making sure my first one arrived and worked.  I love them! Transfer speeds are great and they triple the space on my phone. I have 42 gigs of music on my phone and use it to stream music when in my car. This card works like a charm.
8325	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I'm on a small budget this summer, so I bought this camera for fun. It doesn't drain your batteries before you even took a picture(I took about 40 pictures(without flash) with my cheap rechargeable batteries). The four  stars missing is for the worst quality I've ever seen in my life. I suggest  to never use the flash(all my pictures taken with flash were 90% full of  light, so it's all white!)

I bought this DVD/CD player to use with a netbook that I bought, but it has not arrived yet, so I can not tell if it will work in the netbook.

  If you don't demand much in the way of bass or treble, the audio range is acceptable. As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up.

7155	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This worked well to transfer a caller ID signal to an area where I have a cable box and TV.

1894	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I need a simple replacement cover for my Nook Simple Touch, as my old one was cracking and peeling in several different places.  I had splurged on a fancier cover the first time, but seeing how it fell apart after several years of constant use anyway, decided to go for plain and simple utility.  I was initially uncertain as to how this cover would work out, especially since it doesn't have a closure clasp like my original cover, but so far things have worked out great.  The cover is sturdy and protects my Nook as it bounces around in my purse every day, and the lack of a clasp isn't as life changing as I thought it might be.  Definitely a keeper.
if you have kids on the trip, you need a bigger one.
This product is really just awful in comparison.  Annoying to say b/c I was unhappy with Amazon in relation to what happened to my Kindle.
But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.
4168	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The mini SD card works fine - it still takes pictures on my cell phone that I have no way to transfer to a computer since the adapter broke.  The adapter split in half after a few weeks.  I guess it couldn't handle the incredible stress of being pushed in and out of my computer with my finger tip. Won't be buying this brand again.  PS - didn't work at all with the SD slot on my PS3, which can handled all sorts of photo card and USB devices just fine.  Stear clear.

Here is how I use it :
1572	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Need I say more?  Ok I will: The price is right.  If your primary goal is READING ACTUAL WORDS (What a thought!!!) then this e-reader is an excellent choice. The GlowLight is particularly helpful if reading in bed or in situations where the device is being backlit (such as sunlight through a window).

The set comes with two doorstop kits. Each kit consists of a stainless post with a magnetic wheel, a small stainless ring with a rolling magnet, along with screws and mounting hardware. Installation is very simple: Mount the post on the wall (baseboard or slightly above) and then use it to find the exact spot on the door to mount the catch. Mount the catch in the correct spot, and the project is finished!
8691	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	It looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my 2-way radio i soon realized it's a joke. You can hear people through it but couldn't talk through it. I had to unplug the mic if I wanted to talk to anyone. 100% waste of $20. I would return it but my luck with getting my money back when I return something isn't good since I never do. Save your $20 and buy something else.
2031	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Excellent for using my laptop when it is too dark to see the keys. I also have one that works of AAA batteries, but I used it so much, I got this one instead to save on battery costs.

Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N altogether.
Also, just to note, it boasts an "Ultimate 8 brush system" but the "brushes" are just 1-2 tiny bristles each spaced around the center of the disc. Not much of a brush system if you ask me...

My "P3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor" that I bought on Amazon this summer.  I put a label on it that says something like push "up" 3 times to show Watts (which is the only function I use).  I also measured every electronic thing in my house and put a brother label on it that showed the power use when off/on and idle if that applies.

While the plastic was a bit of a  turn-off, at least the brushed stainless steel makes the case a bit more  attractive and looks pretty sleek much like the Palm V itself. I imagine  that is part of the reason you bought the V instead of the III or the  VII.

8462	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	About 5 years ago I purchased my first trackball. It was simply cheaper and I could use it left handed. My hands never felt better, and my wrist never got sore.

I had  been using the Microsoft IntelliPoint trackball for about one year When I  received this Logitech creation

It has also been my experience that these tapes are rugged and can be used again and again.  These seem to hold up well and this may or may not be true of other vendors.  I think any reputable company makes comparable tapes in terms of durability, but if you are looking for high quality video, then you may feel the extra money is worth the marginal additional cost.
This is an outdated product with the advent of built-in networked printers and most newer routers with printer management features included. After using it I can not come up with a scenario that this would be useful... If so please let me know.
quality so so on the tapes, but the fun is priceless
1874	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This cover is very neat!  The clasp has a magnet and it flips around in front or in behind if you have it open or closed.  It's not a magnet so powerful you can lift cars in a junk yard with it, but its plenty functional for this application.
738	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I am awarding this mount 4 stars. I used the Video Secure mount for my 23 inch TV which weighed only 13lb. The hardware supplied was excellent for mounting it on a wood wall stud. The arm of the mount detaches so that it is easy to mount the wall plate to the stud. The mount was more than adequate for my light weight TV. It can be adjusted to swivel and tilt. The only negative was that while the plate mounted to the back of the TV with the screws provided, the lower left corner interfered with the power plug. Video Secure can provide a mount with a smaller plate. Rather than return my mount for the smaller plate, I chose to use a hacksaw and removed an approximately one by two inch corner in order to permit the plug to enter the TV. So with that caution in mind, I would recommend this product very highly. If I had ordered the smaller plate originally I would have rated it 5 Stars. I was able to do the job without any help. With a heavier TV, an extra pair of hands would be useful.
As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.

9595	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Excellent quality and does the job.  Prints out nice, clean, crisp and bold text. Does not fade, or tear.  Excellent solution for permanent or temporary professional labels.
9940	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Cant really get anything clear on any channels.
541	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have a full 42" HD flat screen mounted on this. Not only does everything look better than strapped to a table, but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have.  It was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint, being a single stud wall mount.  The other major point of this mount is how many sized TV or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept.  My TV mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid, yet adjusts with little effort.  This is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money.

The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.

1507	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I am a loyal Nook user. When my Simple Touch would no longer hold a charge, I searched and found this one. It was new in original packaging. It is my favorite ebook reader for many reasons: external storage, not back lit, fast page refresh, many font options, sharp e-ink display. I especially like that my side loaded files are read and displayed exactly as I have them on the SD card with easy access. Nook has continued to 'screw the pooch' with their readers ever since this one. I don't know what I'll do when these are all extinct. My only complaint, therefore the loss of one star, is the price. I paid out of desperation! Maybe we'll all get lucky and Nook will get it right next time. Bahaha!
This was a difficult book to review because I loved it, and I hated it, and I wanted to tell you why, but much like "Sixth Sense", that would reveal far too much.  You may find yourself a little irritated by Tom's obsession with (oops, can't say, because that's a spoiler), but if you like "different" then I truly believe you'll love this book.  A fantastic debut novel, and one I'm glad I didn't miss.
Which is kind of sad, because for all it's faults there is a goldmine of intellectual property on this hard drive. The articles, pictures, even advertisements are great to read. Sure I'd like higher quality scans, but I own both the Rolling Stone and National Geographic box sets and poor quality scans are an issue for all digitized magazines. So grab it while you can, because I have a feeling this won't be on the market for that long.

1463	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I've owned this original Nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it.  I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N's concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.

My 6-year old top-of-the-line Nakamichi A/V receiver just  did not have the inputs necessary for the S550D so I purchased a new  Marantz SR-18 A/V receiver. The S550D has component video and digital  outputs as well as direct-out 5.1 channel sound so your A/V receiver should  have these capabilities. The video and audio quality are truly exceptional  in both Dolby Digital and Lucasfilm THX surround. I can assure you that you  will not need to go to movie theaters again after you watch movies on the  S550D.

Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.

3185	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This is a great print server and it should get 5 stars. However, someone in there infinite wisdom set the Ip to static instead of DHCP. The IP address is set to 192.168.0.10. If you are like like most of us our IP is 192.168.1. Once you can get the IP changed it is easy to set up. I did not use their software. You can easily web in and set the print server and then go to add a TPC/IP printer on your PC.

I would really suggest this to anyone looking for a capable efficient SD card
Also worth mentioning is that it has a plastic prong instead of a ground. While it fits securely in the wall, and the prong is not fragile, the plug isn't grounded. I was aware of this when I bought it so I didn't take off any stars.

If you are looking for a large field radio, Grundig's 450dlx is fair but will run between $80-100. Tecsun makes great small radios with DSP and cost a fraction of the Grundig line but they are all very small. I will also mention Grundig's other field radio, the 350dx, but at a cost of $80 it also has the same station drift that rivals the RCA 7887. With China becoming better at producing electronics, it won't be long before we will have a field radio with DSP and then many of the problems that exsist with all the models will disappear.

After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.

So my advice to anyone who owns these particular binoculars is to protect them from being dropped or even bumped into trees, etc very hard since the housing is brittle and will shatter. If you use them in Winter, they will be even more brittle and the housing will shatter even more easily than in warm weather like we have now.

First off I also have a LOUD HUMMING sound coming from the adapter that I don't get from the other 3 adapters. Not so obvious when you have the music turned up but definately obvious when you are in between tracks. I was pleased to see that it has dual magnetic heads like my Monster adapter but it produces very low pre amp volume thus requiring you to turn up the volume and getting the loud humming.  There is absolutely no lower end bass unless you crank up the bass on the tape player.  The mids and the treble sound fine though.

I recently got another Paperwhite while on sale as I kept hearing great things and wanted a second eInk night reader.  One of my friends checked her low light setting on a 2nd Generation. They fixed the issue of the splotchy lighting and the low light setting is lower than the Nook's.  Other than the side buttons, which I love on my Nook, it is the better device now, that is the 2nd Generation Paperwhite.  Slightly sharper, slightly smaller, bigger memory without a card, brighter and dimmer light settings.  Still I think the first generation should be avoided.
Battery life is quite decent.  About 4+ hours of listening time before a change. And besides, since it only takes a singe AA battery, a spare in the pocket doesn't take up that much room.  Battery life will depend on the volume you play your songs, if you use the backlight, etc..

It was something of a detective/mystery novel and had some very good foreshadowing, as well as some interesting plotting, keeping you guessing. Every time you think you're sure of the culprit something comes up that makes you doubt yourself, right up to the conclusion.

8469	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I have many shortwave radios around the house and use them primarily for easy access to many regular AM and FM stations.  I use a Sony SW7600G (black version) as a clock radio because it only has 10 presets per band.  It's how you switch the stations that's important and the YB400PE requires you to key in two digits plus the enter key to change stations--if the memory preset is two digits, why do you have to press enter?  The Sony takes one keystroke (granted, though, the new silver-colored Sony doesn't do this either).  Surely if you're looking for programs on the same shortwave frequencies this is useful, but the frequencies change so much I always use the WRTH and PTWBR books and never use the presets.

What I like about it is the price on spec with expandable memory.
The only negative I have is that the part that holds the US plug into the device could be a little more snug.  It felt like it was going to fall out at times (and did fallout 1-2 times but that wasn't much over 6 weeks of use).
*UPDATE:
3172	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Awful to use. This is VERY basic and will not support many of the purposes you plan to use it for. Unless you have a very specific need for this you're better off paying the premium for the premium versions out there. However, if you still believe read on....

5107	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I've bought Sony shower radios for 20 years - this is the third (and by far the best) model, and I've had at least one of all three models.  The digital tuning is essential - you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station.  I love the presets, and listening to 60 Minutes and similar TV shows is great.  The solid base means it's less likely to fall over, or off of things.  The radio is pretty tough - I've dropped it and had nothing happen, but once the AM antenna broke and that was that for talk radio.  And the batteries really do seem to last forever!  On the one I have now (five years old), the plastic waterproof top is cracking, and the FM antenna caught on something and pulled loose.  So, I'm buying another.  Don't EVER stop making this radio, Sony!

9957	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I like the size and design, but this radio must not have much range at all.  I live close to a truck stop.  Over a 3 day period, I asked for several "radio checks" from home (standing outside) and while traveling down the interstate.  I got one response on the interstate.  When I tried to continue the conversation, I got nothing.  I'm assuming he heard me as I was passing him and then he quickly got out of range.  I wanted to like this, but I think the useable range is less than 100 yards.  I sent it back for a refund and ordered a President Andy USA.
Remember, I mentioned he loved to eat. Well, once initial prickliness was set aside and he experienced Tori's cooking, this graduate student soon had a job as his personal chef. Tori is a strong, salt-of-the-earth character who dispenses wisdom and love with every meal she prepares. Like her grandmother, whose recipes she wants to use to turn into a book, Tori's warmth and kindness is clearly evident. I love her take-no-prisoners attitude with Rye when she walks into him relaxing - along with a groupie - and when she refuses to wear the see-through apron that his former cook/mistress had left behind.
8298	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased these with the intent of using for bird watching but they literally make me feel dizzy and green.

On the other hand, they are by far more ergonomic than the old ones I owned, feel great, solid, nice set...but wish I'd kept my 30 year old set instead. Not good for bird watching. Can't begin to imagine for sports. Perhaps its my eyes? Unsure but they don't compare to 30 year old set.

Please know that I'm not partial to B&N. It's a bookstore. I have no loyalty to them as they have never put out an electronic product before. At the same time, I also own some Sony products and they continue to work either fine or great. I don't hate Amazon, nor the Kindle. In fact, I use Amazon for purchases frequently and I would have bought the Kindle if I was partial to it. Same goes for Sony. However, I did my own comparitive research on e-readers and concluded with the Nook being the best fit for me, my needs, and my expectations. All so far, have been met. Whatever the case with negative "geek" reviews, here's my take on the Nook:
It is certainly not "feature rich" but who needs all that nonsense for AM and FM radio?  More feature would just get in my way.
9119	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great products and does wonderful job of cleaning the DVD player. Keeping it clean prolongs the life and also one gets a better picture. Thanks for good and dependable product.

At this moment I still do not know why W7Pro will not read the exFAT formatted card. All my research says W7 has the ability to "see" the device. Anyway I did find a solution. XP has a patch that will allow the use of exFAT device and after I installed this patch to one of my XP systems the issue was solved as far as data transfer between my S3 and the PC. I plug in the cable that came with the phone to my XP system and data transfer worked as it should.

1457	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I went from the Sony Reader Pocket Edition (which I really did like) to the Nook after the Wifi only version came out and I do not regret the move.  I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.

The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.

1877	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This is a boss case. It's an official Nook case and clips in very nicely. There is a back button to turn off the device with ease. The magnet catch is great. If you don't want the flap open. the magnet hold it back in place so you can read it with one hand. Durable and soft to the touch. The inside is white which may get dirty but cleaning in a breeze.

This is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking "not too bad" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.

Of course nothing is perfect and the only negative is they really should have used 4 fasteners instead of the two to secure the reader in the case. If they had it would be perfect with with no comparison. I am not hard on any of my electronics (iPads, Macbook, iPhone, etc) so I have no fear of dropping or breaking my Nook, but not everyone is as gentle.

Is there a noticeable difference between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps?  It depends on your usage, but if you regularly work with files larger than about 300 KBytes or larger, you'll notice a tangible difference.  For truly large files (like graphics/movies, or when installing an application via a network drive), a 10 second transfer at 100 Mbps will take well over a minute at 10 Mbps.
8425	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works correctly.
I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.

1. Moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume, but a small effect at high volume.
1635	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I've been listening to and reading a lot of books over the past year. Often they fall short of expectations. Many are too wordy or the plot is weak or the pace is too quick or too slow. Nightfall however, is a real standout. It's a wicked detective mystery, framed with suspense and paranormal machinations.



Update:  I tried to load it after the fail on Win 8, on a laptop I have with Win 7.  After loading the software, Windows would not start, and still will not.  I would not try it on Win 7 unless you know what to do when it won't start.  I have to have mine repaired, and minimum repair is $70.  That's a high price to pay for just trying a product that was defective.
2813	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Crackerjack monitor for 400 bucks. Looking at the other reviews, it'll last about a year, so I guess it costs about $1.10c a day, which is not bad at all.
Everything now looks great, and is fully digital. Without this we might have lost some very valuable home video to the abyss. It has changed the game for home VHS backup. I highly recommend this to anyone who is unwilling to part with their VCR, and especially to the folks that have less-than clean-room kept home movies. 15 years of abusing these tapes and they've been brought back to life thanks to this great product.

4364	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It's a cable...regular USB on one end, micro USB on the other.  Does a fine job to plug your phone into a USB slot on the computer at work so you don't need to buy a second charger.

And by all means run it on batteries - the D cells give the unit a wonderful heft that keeps it stable and even seems to improve the sound somewhat, and are remarkably long-lasting.
So, make sure that the Micro SD you're buying will work with your device.  The safest bet is to go into the store and try it on your device.
692	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	The wall mount installed easily and works smoothly.  The only downside is adjusting the up and down tilt, you must loosen a bolt most of the way before you can muscle the TV into a different position.
Would highly recommend this product to friends & family. Will buy more of these in the future.

1254	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I have had my Nook for over a year now and I think it is a great ereader. HOWEVER DO NOT buy your content from Barnes and Noble. In the first few months I had it I purchased about 30 books using their awesome click to buy feature. Then back in February, I thought I lost my credit card and cancelled it. I hadn't yet updated my new card on Barnes and Noble's site when I went to reread a book I had purchased months before. IT WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD. I called support and was told that their policy requires an active credit card to access books I have already paid for. This policy creates a lot of the problems.

These are VERY strong binoculars, they are 16x the magnification, the 50 ( the other #) is simply the size of the front lens.. its 50 mm in diameter ( wide)... they are very strong and you can see things very far away. If you need a pair for a concert or a football game or something, then I believe these would be way to powerful and large. ( also I read somewhere, and I think its true that anything over 10x the magnification ( these are 16x) that you should use a tripod, since its too hard to see properly, since it needs to be completely still.

5078	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My husband was using 2 radios in his bathroom.  Whenever I would clean his bathroom it drove me crazy having to clean around the radios and their chords.  The reason he had 2 is he like to listen to 2 different stations but didn't like to turn the dial to find them.  So when I found this radio that had push buttons like a car radio and no chord I thought it would be perfect.  He is happy and I am happy.  He even takes it into the shower which I never expected him to do.  So far it works perfectly!
Simply plug an ethernet cable in to the switch/router, and into the print server.

At $40, it's hard to go wrong with this radio. The next step up would be a shortwave radio like the Grundig S350 ($100) or the Sangean CCRadio Plus ($150).

1226	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.
I would definitely recommend these! They are so handy to have around. Plus they were really low cost and fast shipping! A+ all around
8972	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I received this DVD player yesterday 11/30/99 and my son tried to install it. He is not a genius at electronics. We called the Toshiba service 1-800 support line and were patiently assisted with the installation. This was  extremely helpful to us. This is easy to install but if you aren't an  electronic wiz, this is a very good asset. The DVD player itself seems  flawless to us at this point. I would recommend it highly.

1253	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.

I have been running two 30's for about five years.  I got the Dell's when they were about the only game in town.  There really is no other way to go than two side-by-side 2560x1600 displays if you like to build a Powerpoint and want to edit content in another program at the same time.  I spent 3x the $$ as this one for each of them.  They are still humming away and one has a little bit of burn-in sometimes.  Who would have thunk an LCD would do that?  Well, my iPad mini does it too, so go figure.

1287	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have always been a fairly skeptical critic of e-readers.  When I first heard of the Kindle, I thought the idea was pretty absurd, to need an electronic device that mimics something as universally understood as a book.  However, as I grew older and grew more cynical that I will probably never get my 10+ books I've lent out over the years back, the idea of an e-reader started to sound more desirable.  Enter the Nook.

I've been highly impressed with the Superadio III over the last six months.  Reception is great - it succeeds where numerous (Clarion car stereo, for example) others fail.  I've been running AC power, but this unit is supposed to play for 400 hours on D cells.  So I'm ready if I need to be.
9154	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I assume it worked. But I still have the same issues. I think the cleaner work fine, but is not the issue with my DVD Recorder. It plays the same, it just doesn't record many disc (DVD-RW or DVD-R). I don't know what going on with this thing?

5999	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	If more people used this product, or even Windex in a pinch, they would not have to buy so many replacement disc players.
* Organizational options are sparse. You can organize by author and title, but that's about it. Sorting through sideloaded media, if you have a lot of it, can be a real pain. Also, there's no way to delete B&N books. They have to be archived, which means they are still on the nook taking up space.
6432	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This works and I would tell others that it is worth it.  Easy to set up and it works fine.
This one is very light and I can get it to adjust with very little effort, I have some arthritis in my knuckles, so this is a very nice asset.  also I am 5'2" and I struggled with the older wall mount, this one is in the Identical Location and moves in and out so easily.
You may look for reviews on your wireless router and find a 1-star review which will stop you from buying it, yet it may be for some unrelated product and the one you're looking for might be the king of the hill.

You see, I used to listen to cds, like all through college, but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids. Plus, you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp. Basically I cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless I have extremely good speakers, and that's not often.
2622	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I haven't had it all that long and was disappointed when it suddenly stopped working altogether. Even when it did function it was spotty in certain vehicles power ports. I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because it was relatively cheap, but obviously you get what you pay for.
739	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.

1468	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Highly disappointed. I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?

I previously tried using a chromecast for mirroring my Nexus phone, but the input lag and reduction in quality didn't cut it.  Audio was a little off sync with chromecast also.

Those readers that enjoy fast-paced thrillers, with a combination of mystery, suspense and action will be right at home with this novel. The plot is not overly complex, and some of the surprises are not that hard to anticipate, but the experience is definitely enjoyable. Human trafficking is not a novel topic, but in this book the author uses a particular perspective to make it "taste fresh". Also, the two main characters, a Chinese inspector looking for her daughter and a hopeful peasant coming illegally into the UK, present a nice set of contrasts, which I found helped the story quite a bit.

When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.

On a little side note, if you're going to use this with a Motorola VE240, be prepared for longer than normal load times. The phone seems to index all the MP3s on the card, each time you load the music player. It could be, because the phone isn't very powerful (as phones go) and no fault of the card itself. That got annoying to me, and I just went back to the 2GB card that came with my phone.
At first, the switching of viewpoint from omniscient to first person was a little awkward. Cole, the father of twins, is reading a book to them that is written by his father, Jake. The book he is reading is told in first person, and relates a tale from Cole's childhood. The portions featuring the `adult Cole' become scarce after the first quarter, though, making for a smoother read.

Since these are important memories, I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' VHS tapes is something important to me.  Comparing these tapes to local price, the price here on Amazon is very competitive.  After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting.  Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur, but it's great to be able to get this product when you need it, for a reasonable price.

669	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Compared to mounts I have used on other display panels, this is very poor quality. Motion joints have unpredictable friction. Loosening or tightening joints is good for one or two motions, then they loosen more or become sticky. I would not mount a $600 display on such a poorly made mount. I have returned it to Amazon. Return process was very easy. High marks for that!

Perhaps the best reason to buy this USB cable from Amazon is to get their hefty discount on Belkin products. You'll pay about a third what you would at your local electronics store.  Now that's a bargain!

6773	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works well. I used this as part of a wok-fi (wifi-antenna). A strainer served as a receiver dish, and boosted my signal, since my home's wifi-doesn't completely reach my shop, unassisted.
4164	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The capacity of this Micro SDHC 4gb.  This works great for my blackberry curve 9330.  I use it for video, music, pictures and anything else on the phone one could think of.  The price was too good to pass up.  Kingston makes good products.  I have a 4gb flash drive that is 5 years old from Kingston, and it works great today.  This a good buy. :)

When closed, the cover has a quarter-inch elastic band near the right edge that's used to keep the front cover closed.  To my eye it seems a little flimsy, but in practice, it's worked well and has been easy to use.
We got the tape, inserted it correctly.  But the cartridge was faulty and it unraveled on the second label.  Irreperable.  So we called Brother and -- guess what -- the tapes have NO WARRANTY!!

The TravelFlex beats out the XtraFlex, however, because of its size and weight.  I tend to hold my book or Kindle with one hand at or near the bottom edge.  The book therefore acts like a lever, magnifying the force exerted by the weight of the reading light.  I found that the XtraFlex, with its three batteries, made holding my book less comfortable than the TravelFlex, with its single battery.  The XtraFlex is especially difficult to use with a paperback book because it tends to cause the pages to bend backwards.  The TravelFlex is also smaller and sleeker, making it easier to carry along.
There is one disadvantage to this trackball. It is  too narrow. I'd say my hands are average, but this device is just too  narrow at the back. I'm constantly squeezing the space between by thumb and  index finger to use it.

Some users of this product had problems when the devices were plugged into:
NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).
Again, hard to tell without spoilers, so I will just say that the author used a particular type of formatting that kind of gave away the 'twist' way too early.
My biggest complaint about this  particular player though, is how tedious it is to enter track names in. Of  course, this is something you don't even GET with CD players, but if a  feature's there, I expect it to work well. The worst thing is that you  can't listen to music and enter the track name at the same time. I could  live with how long it takes to do, if I didn't have to do it in silence.  For that reason alone, I would probably recommend looking at other minidisk  players.
I did a custom calibration on my Windows and Mac machines with the standard monitor calibration widgets and everything looks just lovely in all the desktop and graphics applications I use.
8971	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	If your looking for a DVD player that visually delivers...looks someplace else and don't believe the hype, as the Toshiba 3109doesn't deliver the goods.  Edges were unfocused and colors were soft. After another tweak session with Video Essentials it appeared that nothing improved and I was at a complete loss... until... a friend of mine let me borrow his Sony 550D.  In a single word... WOW!  What a difference between the two players.  The 550D surpassed the 3109 in most every respect, colors leaped off the screen, shadows appeared as shadows and not dancing black pools of fast moving artifacts.  The only area that the 3109 bettered the Sony 550D was in CD playback - you have to love HDCD and what it does for audio playback.  But isn't the 3109 a DVD player?  Of course it is, so if video is your main concern then skip the 3109 and go with the Sony 550D - it costs more but the extra money is money well spent.  My next venture will pin the Sony 550D against the Sony 7700, but then that's whole different ballgame and since this is a review of the 3109 I'll stop here.  END

561	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games.

9655	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this cartridge for use with the P-Touch labelmaker. They are easy to peel (but cannot be re-positioned easily once you have placed them). The ink also does not rub off of them which makes them more hardy. I purchased them on Amazon at a fraction of what they cost at my local retailer (Office Depot).  The silver with black print makes them a bit fancier than the black on white ones that I have been using.  Perfect for making lavels for files or other household and office items.

I am running the monitor on RHEL 6.4.  The monitor periodically (once a week) would forget how to transmit its EDID on reset from standby.  I ended up downloading the EDID from the monitor and setting up my xorg.conf to load from file rather than from the monitor.  No more issues.

5192	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances.  Don't bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer.

Lastly, I'm glad I bought a case for it because I pretty much take it every place I go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken.

Hollywood is Like High School With Money is the first Zoey Dean novel that I've read. Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I'm inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.
But it wasn't very hardy.  I took it camping once, and it was never the same after that.  It took several minutes to "warm up" after you turned it on, and then the sound was distorted for several minutes after that.  And scratchy sounds came out of the speaker when you adjusted the volume.  I figure the radio didn't like the humidity of the day and the dew of the morning.

9002	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	On the first try the outdoor speaker played for 30 seconds then stopped working. I returned to Amazon (no charge) and got a replacement speaker. Opps, same thing, the speaker played nicely for 30 seconds and then went dead (the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played). I emailed Amazon.com and wanted to role the dice and give it a 3rd try. Amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one. They refunded all my money also gave me a $10 credit in my account for the hassle. I was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect, the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue. Should I give the speaker another try? I really did like the product if it would only work. I've searched the customer reviews and this problem is NOT isolated to me.  Well, if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after 30 seconds. It seemed like a solid product but at the low price of $32.00, I'm not surprised it failed to work. Please leave feedback as I would like to order anothrer myself, but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy Amazon tries to make it.  Also, I wanted to mention that it was very generous of Amazon to give me a $10 credit for my troubles with the speaker... Amazon.com is a very reputable company I recommend them strongly and I will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future.  Best of luck with this one.
Current New Nook (Have had it for about a week): When I looked at the default factory settings screen to set up my nook, I noticed a small tear on the screen (I thought maybe I was imaging it but when I turned the glow light on, it was apparent [...]) as stated in that link, the tear isn't a problem when the glow light is off and in general isn't that noticeable. After using the nook for about maybe five days, I found another tear on the screen. When I turned the glow light on, the first tear that the device came with didn't spill the light throw it like in the picture in the link. The second tear actually did, but it isn't very often that I used the glow light and I don't think it's worth it to return the item since your next device might have either the same problem or the faded lines across the screen, but if it does bother you during your read, you might wanna take that chance.
4360	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	At most, it worked for one month!
As I still have never found a beach condo, hotel room or B&B with adequate lighting for reading, something like this is a must.
As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.
Other then the minor hitch with the TiVo remote it works great. Plus the IR control makes it possible to feed it into my video distribution system and change the input from the other room without having to get up every time.

Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.

I don't usually deal with leather cases, let alone wallet cases for my phones - this is my first experience in using one personally. Its been mostly pleasant, the leather feels good and gives a nice buffered protection should I ever drop my phone as well - seeing as there's breathable room between the back, the case, and then the phone. The pockets hold your cards firmly and I haven't experienced any sort of loosening with the pockets, My only wish with the case is that it'd be a bit thinner or integrated with removing the backplate of the Note 3, but that's a minor issue - this will offer more protection should I drop my phone, much more than I can say for any other flip case. Also, a part of me wishes the latch was magnetic versus buttoned, that's extremely minor as well - personal preference perhaps, its much tighter with the button and guarantees it won't flip open in pocket or on drop, but, at the same time it makes using the Note 3 with one hand even harder than originally.
1318	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N. Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).
803	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	great value
So I returned the Paperwhite, my friend decided to go for a tablet (Nook HD+ because of the responsiveness of tablets and the size, not my preference) and I decided to try out the Glow.  I've heard there are problems with bleed through pin pricks of light from damage on the very sensitive screen.  They now come with screen protectors already installed and I am hoping it protects from that.  Still I figured for the sale price I could use it as a eInk reader without the light if that does occur in the future.
I also have to give Amazon and Moleskine props on the packaging. Remember when you got your Kindle and it was in that nice special box, and it was all wrapped up inside. Well the Moleskine case is packaged in a similar way! Something about the added effort there just helps to make it more special.

5201	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizona's mountains, I can say that the unit is all that's advertised. The manual is cryptic, but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens, the rest is pretty intuitive. I was able to create a waypoint, walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint (with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website)! As long as you keep moving, the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.
I still have 1 left. I gave the rest away...wish I had known how much these sold for~!
7053	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	There's nothing I could really say about this product, but I works as it's suppose to. I'd recommend it to anyone out there that needs an extension for their USB.


1880	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This is the second Lautner cover purchased and was for a gift. The first cover was purchased from Barnes and Noble at twice the price. I have been using that cover for a year and a half and it has held up nicely. The inside was dirty from handling over a year, but I was able to wash off most of the dirt and finger oils using a cloth and dish soap. The advantages of this cover is the magnetic closure which can be flipped to hold the cover open when reading. The only disadvantage is that this cover has only two clips to hold the Nook and the Nook sometimes slips out of the clips. Would be better if the cover had four clips to match the four notches on the Nook.

No use trying to lay out the plot other what others have stated-- I don't think there's a lot of chance of spoiling the book because it's the journey not the end that is intriguing
8770	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	I was really looking forward to getting a hold of this case because of all the good reviews. After receiving this item I was really disappointed in how thick it is and it feels so cheap, granted it was only $10.00. I won't be sending it back but I will be searching for another wallet type case.
3274	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	works great, love it.
The only bad thing is that there is no  treble control, and the bass control is on the back of the sub, which may  be inconvenient for you.  Oh yeah, and the subwoofer is quite large, so  make sure you have enough room first.

2447	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product and it arrive as expected.
With the price at around $80, it might seem to be a bit pricy, but you pay for the convenience of the powerline adapter. It is a simple installation, and instead of spending time troubleshooting, you can spend more time enjoying your new internet connection.
Quality of each page is very good to excellent. However, two-page items have alignment problems. The two sides are not meeting smoothly. This seems to be a production problem and is NOT in the electronic ZENO copy of the magazines.
8219	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I must say that for a simple non-switched 10Mbps Ethernet hub, this one is pretty good.  The metal box and small size makes it pretty handy.  Unfortunately it's pretty outdated for the things you can buy for a few more bucks.  You're probably better spending your money on a Linksys EtherFast 5-port Worgroup Switch, which has a dedicated 100Mbps (or 200Mbps in full-duplex mode) of bandwidth in each port....  But if you're adament about a plain 10Mbps hub, this is a very good way to go.

Colors are wayyyy off when compared with a higher quality monitor.  The monitor is very dark colored overall, even tweaking in the gpu driver couldn't compensate the colors enough - one of the colors (green channel) just isn't bright enough to balance without the screen so dark you can't see it.  When you have a window open you can see vertical and horizontal lines across the screen from the window to the monitor edges.  You can clearly see flickering when there is something semi-bright displayed.  Power supply is the size of a brick.
Nice transaction
2740	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Works well and feels great! It fits right over the keyboard and matches all of the keys and buttons perfectly.

I can't find anything wrong with this product

Also cleaned the 6 CD system, thought it was having overheating issues.since it is still cold weather, may still have the issue, however no new problems after using the cleaning disk.

4567	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	Like another reviewer on the 90-Minute 5 Pack item, I can verify that these tapes have too much drag in the mechanism. On my Nakamichi BX-300, they frequently stop during recording or playback. It's a tension problem, wherein a high end deck will purposefully stop advancing the tape to avoid breakage; basically, it thinks the tape is stuck. Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. I've had no problem with other, commercially available cassettes on this deck.
1509	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	It's a Nook, they are great! This one features a backlit screen which means you can read it in bed without keeping anyone awake. My only complaint is the clunky software to transfer books off a computer. I'm sure this has been remedied in newer versions, but aside from that this is a great alternative to a regular tablet which can bother some people's eyes from prolonged reading. The lack of glare is also very nice. Can't say that about your iPad when you try looking at it in any kind of sunlight!

I use the charger with the Samsung data cable that came with my phone and it works nicely, on both ports. CAUTION: The fine print on the front of the charger indicates the power available from each port and it's intended use. The bottom port is 1 amp and is the "universal" charging port. The top port is 2.35 amp and is intended for iPad. The more powerful top port does work with my Samsung Epic 4g but I limit it's use because it heats up the phone and the charger, and charging the phone's battery that fast is bad for it. Using the the bottom, 1a port, I'm able to use my phone's GPS feature without losing battery charge, so it at least keeps up. Using the phone for calls, the 1a port charges the phone while I'm using it. I've only used the 2.35a port once, in a serious pinch when my phone was dead.

Note Taking.  No built-in app for writing notes!  The Tablet has a microphone, but you can't even create audio notes.  Note taking is the one killer app I wanted for home use.  I write notes everywhere to the point of being buried by them.  Third-party apps saves the day.  Evernote works great with the Tablet - and supports audio notes and keyboard rotation.  Verdict: FAIL

4859	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Even in the age of DVRs and Tivo some of us still use VHS to record our programs. This tape although still produced is hard to find in stores but Amazon supplies it. For years Maxell has been the best VHS tape and even though their product line has gotten smaller their High Grade line (formally HGX-Gold) are simply the best out there. Awesome picture quality that will look better than the original broadcast. Still use a monoral VCR? No problem. Sound Quality in SLP mode is marvelous (which is what I use because I want the maximum amount of recording time). I recommend the 8 hour length  because of the extra two hours of recording time. I used to use TDK 8-hour Hi-Fi or Extra High Grade tapes but TDK has stopped producing good tapes at long lengths so I moved to Maxell which is more than satisfactory. If you can't find these in stores buy them here.

But this cable makes it possible to achieve a balance between functionality and aesthetics.  With this Belkin component, you can now think of setting up an entire room as an information hub, rather than just huddling your computer station into a cramped corner.

The built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.

2. Because this radio doesn't have a digital PLL tuner, it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you weren't looking for.

Also, the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes. It is also very inexpensive. I would recommend to anyone.

There are two major limitations to this unit. First, it doesn't have an external antenna jack, so you can't add an external antenna (except a rebroadcasting antenna, and they're pricy). Second, the flat panel antenna means that you basically need to hold the unit level to work properly. You can't stick it in your shirt pocket, as you could a unit with a helical antenna. The ETrex units have the same limitations, so if you really care about these features you'll have to look at the next model up. It hasn't really been a problem for me.
For the plane, the Maxells are a bargain, but their sound quality is not "audiophilic" and the cumbersome inline battery pack make them not a great choice for most home or other day to day activities. They should come with some kind of holster or clip for the inline battery pack so you can attach it to your clothes when you're moving about, otherwise you have to hold the battery pack or let it swing around tugging at the wire. The Jabras and a lot of the other models have detachable cords which is a much better design, but on the plane you're just sitting, so having the line and battery pack cradled in your lap is no big deal. Buy these Maxells for a less expensive headphone for the plane, but for real audio purposes you'll probably want one of the more expensive models, but of course, that depends on how particular you are about sound quality. If that's not a big issue for you, these might be just enough for you at home too. For television watching, I think they'd work fine.
Overall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20" extension.  Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47".
MAXIMIZING BATTERY LIFE:  The best strategy to maximize battery life is to use J-buds (or similar in-the-ear earbuds) mentioned above.  They are very "efficient" which means that they produce the same volume at a lower power drain.  To test the efficiency of headphones, just plug them in and listen (without adjusting the volume)---the loudest will be the most efficient.

I am pleasantly surprised that the dry fabric actually removed finger print and dusts rather easily with push of a thumb from center of the disc outward.

This unit is identified by its translucent light blue rectangular box. It uses a separate power supply. The Model Number is ZIP100USB. It can operate either horizontally or vertically (like a floppy drive). A device that connects with a USB cable requires Windows 98 or later. You should use the software EJECT command to remove a ZIP disk in Windows 2000 because the disk caching system may have data that needs to be written out. The IOMEGA software should be installed in Windows 2000 instead of the built-in support.
Know what you are getting into before you buy.

9234	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Great camera once you learn the menus and buttons. Advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy. I have avoided the auto-everything camera's because I like controlling all of the creative process. Because of  this, it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons, but it was  not hard. The Coolpix 950 still allows you to control the creative process  but I would recommend a good book on digital photography (such as Real  World Digital Photography) to get you started, especially if you're a film  junkie such as myself. Note: a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger CompactFlash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. The first two replace your film and  processing budget. One nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card. Mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot. A light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a "speed rating" of ISO 80 and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash. If you must use flash, get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and, as with all small cameras,  produces flat featureless images. You'll also need access to a good, fast  color printer to print out the full reference manual. A copy center such as  Kinko's should work. This is not a camera for the "instamatic"  crowd. Hint: negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not  an out-of-the-box instant hit, but with a little creative work, the camera  does well. I may trade up to the CoolPix 990 in a year or two after the  price comes down.

2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.

PROS:
brightness lines
I added the flexible extension to the light and it was the perfect length to go from my rear USB port, up the back of the screen, and out over the keyboard. The brightness was impressive and ample. It looked brighter than I remembered the 2 LED battery powered light being. The cast of the light is also perfect- it covers the entire keyboard evenly, and makes every key easy to read. I won't need to order the 2 LED version for work, this one is more than capable. I don't think I'd even order the 2 LED version to replace it if I decided that I wanted a keyboard light for my home laptop. Great product from Mighty Bright, now if only they'd produce a super long version to eliminate the need for an extension!

1447	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	B&N locked the Nook Tablet since beginning of January to remove sideloading of apps and such. If you were hesitant to purchase one because of that, don't be. I was real dissapointed they did that so I found a way to root mine and now I am running Go launcher along side the B&N interface. I have full access to the android market for tablets and can download and install any apps I want. I voided the warranty by doing this, but If I had not been able to unlock it's full potential I would ahve brought it back anyway, so no loss here. As long as it's rooted to allow install and modification as you want this becomes a much better device than the Kindle Fire. The hardware, look, and feel is superior. It was the B&N bloatware and restrictions that were holding it back. Now that I have access to other book sites like Touchybooks (which are way cheaper than B&N books) I am really enjoying this with my kid and wife. I also can access cloud services now which means I am streaming my music from Google Music service while I read. That I really love.

No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.
This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.

66	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I highly recommend Elephant Run, by Roland Smith. Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.

1711	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I read a book purely for entertainment. I can live with a few grammatical errors. This book was full of twists and turns and shocks and surprises that I almost didn't go to work when I was supposed to. I was at the point where I really hated to put it down. One thing I really appreciated about this book, unlike many I have started and discarded, is a person really gets to know the character before being introduced to more. This alleviates a lot of confusion. There are some books that have too many unimportant characters that I've had to go back a few pages just to try and figure out who they are talking about and what their importance is. Not this book. All the characters play an important role. Also, there weren't a lot of wasted pages describing unimportant things that really have no bearing on the plot. Too many books will waste pages describing in detail a sex scene or history from a past life that has nothing to do with the story. Yep, this is one of my more enjoyable books that I've read.

7776	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This circular outlet is perfect for the area under our oval conference table at work, where we hold many training sessions. We have used it for many months and not had any issues with it. It's heavy enough that it stays in place, and light enough that I can lean down, yank it over, plug in something and shove it back under the table without having to crawl underneath. It is very sturdy and seems to have taken all our (and our trainees') abuse without any problems. Perfect for areas where a long power strip won't work or would be less convenient.

Moving the printer from a laptop USB connection to this print server was painless. However you need to make sure that your printer is on the supported list or is PCL5 or Postscript compatible. Older printers may not work.
As others have noted, the only  downsides are the lack of an AC adapter and the horrible headphones that  come with the unit.  This may be a bit subjective, but the design of the  unit itself is also a bit uninspiring.
6678	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Works great! Slow charging tho as your cell won't recognize as original charger. Nice and convenient with 10ft cord
1423	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Nice specs with nice screen. Not worth the price with just the stock operating system, might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model. You cannot use the larger 16gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at B&N restricts your access to only 1gb of that memory. UPDATE: Because of the unhappy owners B&N will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get 8gb free space.

1327	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.
8934	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	So far the cable is great.  I was concerned about having to use such a long cable between a router and a signal strength enhancer for our cell phones, as I worried that some signal might dissipate over the distance, but no worries.  Our reception has never been better.  I'd order another Belkin cable in a heartbeat.
The device is beautiful. I love the solid rubber backing. The aluminum backing on the Kindle sure looks nice but on a cold Colorado night I do prefer the rubber. It is really nice to see the book cover in full color and with the 1.2 update they just pushed out the device is just as snappy as I would want. Sure it's not going to win any speed contests, but it's supposed to be simulating a book. Not exactly a high speed sport. Page turns seem to be just the same or only very slightly slower than my Kindle 2.

9242	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I use this recorder every day to make notes and record to-do items while driving, etc.  It works very well and the recording quality is decent enough for what I use it for.  There is one large design flaw, though.  The  record button is MUCH too easy to press.  At least 4 times a week, I'll try  to record a message only to find a 70+ minute recording of me walking  around with this in my pocket.  All I do is delete that message and I'm  back in business, but it's annoying.

If they put spiral binding it may scratch the expensive contents of the camera bag. This is a lovely, color coded guide or cheat sheet that will keep you alive when you are in the field, away from the 450+ pages manual that is not very portable, yet indispensable for such a vastly complex camera. I'm so happy with this quick reference. Maybe a tad larger font would have been in order, but I won't chuck it away just because of that.

4486	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	They work.
5324	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios: the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.

I probably could have Super-glued the housing back on but then they would have been subject to fogging since when the housing broke off the Nitrogen that is injected into the housing escaped. Nitrogen is used to prevent the lenses from fogging.
So what is my caveat?  The cord coil.  I like a coiled cord in many circumstances - like plugged into my phone.  I hate when I get a 6' cord and have to deal with a unruly snake that ends up getting tangled all over the place.  However...  When sitting at my desk, the coiled cord tends to pull because my jack is slightly too far away.  I am sure that this will free up a bit over time but right out of the box it is a bit too tightly coiled. Take away half a star for this but I honestly struggle with cords - and the lack thereof!  You either end up with a tangled string that catches on everything, a coil that tethers you too close to the source or a wireless connection that compromises on fidelity, resolution and range.
HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).
5612	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Umm...seriously? $1.63 for these? These cable ties are really good quality, have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all.

7696	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I've had several pointing devices, including standard mouse, track ball, and pad.  None comes anywhere close to being as natural and useful a performer as this one.  Its simplicity of design hooks one almost  immediately, and within a few minutes of use, one doesn't want to go back  to the  mundanity of ordinary mice.  Unlike trackballs and most low-end  touch pads, it's very sensitive, and so makes a servicable stepping stone  for grahpic artists on the way to purchasing a more serious graphics  tablet.

I recently purchased two mp3 players to replace my Sony D-NS707F (not going into details, though I did write a review for that as well).  It was not so much skipping, but inserting random screeches (the only way I know how to describe it) throughout the mp3 CDs that I A) know are good and B) also prior discs without scratches or smudges, would behave the same way.  Not to copy my review of that player, though I do have to say that I see people had it for about 2 months and it started behaving that way for them.  I had it for about 2005 (maybe 2004, but I forgot exactly) to April 2013 with no problem.  It was a victim of HEAVY use too.  I am happy with my two new mp3 players, though I sort of felt bad about the Sony D-NS707... its like an old friend that has lasted me for years and years.

Tripod use:  highly recommended to get a steady picture.  You can get a regular camera tripod for around 18 dollars.  Yes, this binocular comes with a tripod adapter.  No, it's not very easy to find. <g>  The instruction booklet is virtually useless, but I found out through the website that the adaptor is located behind the front cap between the barrels.  Just screw the cap off and viola, there is your threaded coupler.  You will still need to get a binocular adaptor to connect the binoculars to the tripod, but I've found that they aren't too expensive:  around 7-16 dollars for the generic models. I gave this item 4 stars b/c of the poorly written instruction manual and cheap accessories.  Hope some of this info helps.  Can't wait to see the stars tonight!

SWR Readings:  I could not get a good SWR reading on channels 1 through 8.  And i think the SWR was pretty poor between 33 and 40.  But do not let that dissuade you from buying this radio; most people talk on 19 or on channels in the 20s.  Either way, it is still safe to *listen* on channels with poor SWR readings.
9348	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	These are Brother OEM tapes, so they should function flawlessly in their label printers.  I've found them to print sharply, bond securely to varied surfaces, and resist the weather very well - I've used some on wood stakes as plant markers outdoors!

The mike was not quite long enough however... call me a big mouth! It didn't reach around in front of my face. It was very much to the side. Just in the peripheral vision... again something I was sure I could get accustomed to.

Phoned tech again and this one said that it was defective and set up a replacement.  Replacement came and it was doing the same thing.  I left it for nearly twelve hours and nothing happening.

The tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you can't reliably set the radio using the existing marks. I just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencil.

Seems sturdy enough, would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools.  As it is I keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable.
5154	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Great product! It's exactly as the description of the seller.
- The user interface is easy to use, but it's also VERY basic, and there are very few features.  You can organize your books into "shelves," but only on the device itself, and it's a cumbersome process.  You can sort books by title, author, and date added, and... that's pretty much it.  The NST isn't a tablet and I don't want it to be, but there are still some pretty simple features that don't seem like it would have been that hard to add, and more flexible organization is one of them.
Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.

5275	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I've used these on an airplane, in a car, and at home.  The good news is that they're ok comfort wise.  The great news is how good the noise cancelling feature works.  You hit the switch and it cuts out the largest of the background noise-- the road noise in a car, or the roar of the engines of a jet.  It will not remove ALL sound, but will remove a big chunk of it, enough that it's a relief when you turn it on.  Sound quality is good for this price range, and do you really want to have a $200 pair of headphones going through security, getting smushed in your bag, etc.?  Will $200 headphones sound any better on a plane, when there's so much ambient noise?  I think these are very adequate.  My only complaint:  One week past the 90 day warranty, the vinyl of the ear cup separated at a seam, after only about 8 hours of use.  Not sure if mine was defective, and if I used them more often it certainly would have been under warranty.  I've had a low-end pair of Sonys that were not any more durable and didn't have the noise cancelling, and I tried some noise cancelling ear buds that quit working right off the bat, and didn't do near as good a job.  If more expensive gets you more durable, go for it, but I doubt it, I think you're ok taking your chances on these, they do make a difference and make it easier to hear your music/podcasts, etc. while holding out the snotty sinus noises your neighbor keeps making (Are you kidding me?  Three hours of phlegm?  Good thing it wasn't an exit row or I think I might've popped the door).
Another minor annoyance: the case itself is just slightly larger  than the Palm V. But there's a largish (cheap black plastic) hinge outside  the case. In addition, the pin slowly slides out the top of the hinge as  you open and close the case (at least mine does).
Speed has been great.  I haven't noticed any hiccups with performance and this is several rooms away.  I also have this unit plugged into a surge protector which I've heard might muffle / hurt the broadcast range.  So far, I have not seen any slow-downs.
I use this cable to add a extra USB port on my desk so I don't have to bend over and plug in flash sticks or other USB devices.
Nice bright light and the neck is just right for giving me light and movement that I want.

The reason I bought the Rio500 is because  memory is expandable using flash cards. More memory is good. Also, I have  some Compact Flash cards for my digital camera lying around. Unfortunately,  Diamond opted to call their proprietary memory card, a flash card even  though the memory is incompatible with any device using the standard  compact flash card. The only reason I can fathom for the similar name is  duplicity on Diamond's part.
9818	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have been using M cartridges for my P-Touch for years to label anything and everything, including all of those pesky cords and chargers that seem to multiply around the house. We kept ending up with boxes of cords and cables that no one quite knew what they went to, and in many cases they went to devices that had been tossed long ago. By labeling cords when they come in the door, I can better keep track of them and eventually dispose of them without fear of reprisal. The adhesive lasts indefinitely (I haven't had any come loose in the time I have been using the product) and the cartridges dispense correctly every time.

5304	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	The Superradio III is a one of a kind radio that will get you far better AM reception than even the legendary Grundig S350. Its FM is equal to the Grundig S350 and its speaker is even bigger and fuller. I can't overemphasize this speaker. It can fill an entire house. It's the biggest speaker of any radio I own, including my Grundig S350.
It only requires one AAA battery, so that is a huge plus -- it's lightweight, plus I don't have to worry about replacing/recharging a ton of batteries. I think the downside is that I have to replace the battery a little more often than I thought I would. I think I've changed it out 2-3 times already; however, I use rechargeable Eneloop AAA's, so it's really no big deal at all.

I suppose it's because I haven't bought a book light since LED tech really came into its own, but these provide great light and despite using 3 AAA batteries are light enough to clip to a paperback and still hold the book comfortably (even lying down, holding the book in the air).  The clip stays secure, the flexible neck provides a lot of versatility and the price cannot be beat.  I bought one for my wife as well and she loves hers, too.  I threw out two old book lights that I paid twice as much for a couple of years back.

In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.

First, Jack Nightingale may or may not have killed a man, so his police career is over and replaced by a pretty shabby career as a private detective. Then, random people start telling him that, "You are going to hell, Jack..." Then at age 32 he finds out he was adopted, which was bad enough until he finds out who his birthfather was. And as if that is not enough, he finds out that his birth father sold his soul to a devil, who is coming in a couple of weeks to collect.

8850	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	This bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car.  Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks, which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor. This handles that pretty well. Couple cons though, it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly (make sure to check out the dimensions), and it is not always easy to empty out.  The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well, just if it is really full, you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it.  This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor, and I am very happy with the purchase.

It would sometimes recognize that a DVD was in it, but it was never able to play for more than a few seconds.

Anyway, it never worked.
6860	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my DVDs so took a chance on these and ordered them from Amazon. I don't know what they're made of but they work great. They clean blu-ray as well as regular DVDs without a bit of scuffing or scatching. I followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge. For fingerprints, I found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping. The nice thing about these is that they're re-usable until they get dirty.
3171	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	UPDATE (5/2/2015):  After getting a response from someone about what I might be doing wrong, I looked deeper into the issue.  It turns out there is a list of compatible printer that  this device supports.  You should check if your printer is on that list or make sure your printer uses PCL or PS.  Thanks to @Holcomb (see comment below) for clarifying this. If it is not compatible with these standards, don't bother going through the headache of buying and trying to configure. It will not work.

2. 'Rooting' the tablet is a way to bypass the B&N controls and open up the tablet to the full Android experience which not only means access to the Google market and Google apps but also to 'superuser'  functions to enable enhanced control of the operating system. This is not for novices and requires some technical understanding of the Android operating system so likely only a very small number of advanced users would ever attempt this. B&N have attempted to block this too. Really? What exactly is the point B&N?

My friend was so utterly amazed at how well it worked, that he said "for your review, just write "Works Awesome!".  And really, that's all that needs to be said!  You just plug it in, and that's it!

When I plug it in, turn it on and press the PTT button, the radio starts transmitting and doesn't stop until I shut the radio off.  I knew the VOX feature wouldn't work, but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button.  It does not.  However, it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000, but not with VOX.  I'm giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which don't.

4499	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	The frame of these headphones is a terrible design. The ear pieces are solid in a fixed (thick, long) shape with no give and little bend. They are cheap, very hard plastic and uncomfortable. You can slide them around, but unless your head matches the curve of the frame exactly, you will have difficulty finding a comfortable fit. The sound quality is tinny and mediocre. The cord and plug are made of the thinnest, cheapest, flimsiest materials, and will easily break. The plug is not L-shaped which means it is vulnerable to breaking at the point of connection.

I had to save for several months in order to purchase an e-book reader. I did a lot of Internet searches, reading, and comparing features before choosing the "Nook". I also based my choice on past experiences with Barnes & Noble (book stores). I never expected them to "ROB" me as they did.
**Also, i would not purchase this SD card from any other seller besides Amazon. I have had bad experiences from other sellers and their SD cards appeared to either be used or bootlegs because they did not come in proper Sandisk packaging**

If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".
1481	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I bought this device not expecting much out of it.  Reading books is a breeze...the screen is clear even in bright light.  The device is VERY light...feels like holding a small clipboard. I find myself touching the reading part of the screen....just a bad habit as I am used to using my iphone.  As with any device, you might want to breeze thru the manual first because I sure didn't...took me a while to figure out that the "n" on the front is the "home" key.

It's not going to win a beauty contest, but it's highly functional, and the design is a classic.  This reminds me of the ancient XAM with paint stains that sat on the kitchen counter back home.  Everyone shoud have one.

Needless to say, I'm very happy with the quality of the RCA phone jack, it was very easy to install, just like they claimed and my husband was glad to not have dealt with the installation, since I did it.  Another great buy from Amazon. :)

4384	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I originally found one of these on closeout at Cabellas in the bargain cave. I wish I had bought 3 of them. I've abused this spotlight in all kinds of weather for over a year on a 1994 Kawasaki Bayou. I've had no problems with it. The quick release hands free mount is great. It also has a power switch on the back of the unit. It's roughly equivalent to 750,000 candlepower.
Its a great buy, and I'm a Belkin customer for life now.
The Rio takes  SmartMedia cards and can reportedly handle any size, including the upcoming  100+ MB cards; mine works perfectly with a 32 MB Sandisk SmartMedia card.  (96 MB is just about perfect for listening to a full 72-minute CD  recording, say of Beethoven's Fifth, at 160 kbps sound quality.)
5282	Electronics_5	NEG	2.0	The CD player in our 2001 Toyota Avalon would only randomly play PC-burned CDs.  It would reject them outright or they would skip once started.  The problem was not the computer's CD burner, as the CDs played on our 03 Avalon's player as well as on other machines.  Manufactured CDs seemed to play fairly well. (We burn Audible books to CD for listening.)  This product did not fix the problem; in fact, there is no difference in the player's behavior for having been "cleaned".  The problem could well be a slight misalignment of the laser or something else, but be aware that this is not a cure for all ills.  Two stars because it might work well for some, and is not necessarily mislabeled - but it did not work for me and I would not recommend it to a friend without a cautionary note.

The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.

4/9/2015 Update - The monitor I purchased on 2/5/2015 suddenly went black.  It has been a little over 30 days.  I swapped the cables at the monitors (I have two identical monitors) and the problem followed the monitor.  For laughs I swapped the two power supplies and the problem remains with the monitor.  When I power cycle the monitor, it looks like the backlight comes on for a split second and then back off.  Found nothing online about this problem after ten minutes of searching.

The  headphones included with the player are neat looking, but not great  sounding. The fidelity is low, with barely any low and low-mid-range sound.  Assume you will have to spend at least another $25 for decent  ear-buds.

5676	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	This product really does make a difference.  I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all.  I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine.  Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player!
In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.
I usually archive books as soon as I finish them, but this one I have left on my Kindle. I find myself going back to peek in on the characters and I am anxiously awaiting what happens next!

still buy one of the original nooks.  No-brainer.

In the years since is it's introduction, ZIP disks have gained a bad rap that I fortunately have never noticed first-hand. Supposedly very fickle hardware, the disk drive can go bad, damage the disk, and now that disk can damage other drives.  I since I started using ZIP disks in 1996 I have only one disk go bad and I was a moderate user of the format - primarily for the daily archiving of photos and documents.  My drive and the oldest disk I have still work as well today as started using them in 1996.

6325	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I ordered these because most you find are 6 feet long and I don't want all that cable hanging everywhere because I have cats that will try to play with it and then all my equipment ends up on the floor.

Construction:
1973	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	Love this guide! It comes in a laminated fold-out and carries easily in camera bag or even jean pocket. It gives all the basics of the camera and is a nice reference when in the field for all the controls and functions of the Nikon D90. It's saved m  when considering white balance, lighting options or timer issues. Very nice and I highly recommend it.
4501	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Another good buy.  Again, very affordable, and they work.  Far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore.  I like the single wire, it seems to be much easier to manage than two of them..
Was looking for something not too bright, but bright enough, for working at night, and not disturbing the family, using my laptop.  This is PERFECT.  Illuminates the keyboard perfectly, and even has two settings, in case you want to dim it down a little more.  Handy switch right on the top of the lamp housing.  Fully bendable but sturdy neck means placing it at any angle is no problem, and it does not droop -- stays right where you put it.  I've tried many others -- closest I found to what I wanted was a battery operated clip on, by Energizer, the battery folks.  It worked great but only lasted about 12 hours, which is why I wanted a USB powered solution.  Highly recommend this.  Not a floodlight, but perfect for the immediate workspace, which for me is lighting up my keyboard so no eye strain when answering emails, etc., late night.  No glare from housing, and it can be positioned such that it doesn't disturb anyone else.  Thanks Mighty Bright!!!
I can't comment on the audio performance tests.
1837	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	Not enough pages to be useful.
7921	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	It's a cable!  It's closer to 6 feet long.  No problems.  Used it to connect modem to router.  Success.
Conclusion (4/5):
Yamaha RH1C Headphones are super light and breathable:)
The battery life is very good, the electrical cord is a good length & the on/off switch is sturdy with a small green light when on.
2) Extremely easy set-up (took me less than 10 minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room)
I am reducing my rating to One Star because the technical support never informed me to check for this compatibility issue. This could have saved me lot of time.
9444	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	I was a little disappointed that the tape didn't split on the opposite side of writing (to make it easier to peel). If it had that I would have given it 5 stars.

3908	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I needed a mini HDMI cable for my new Canon camera so I could connect it to my TV.  Most cables averaged $40-70.  The reviews on this product were excellent so why spend more money.  I only paid $4.95 and the shipping was free.  The cable arrived earlier than projected.  The picture quality is excellent.  I also appreciate that the cable is 10 feet long.
I tried everything including customer service.  Emailed - never heard from them.  Phoned and the tech blamed me, the books etc but never the Nook.  Resulting conclusion from him was that I should buy books from Barnes and Noble so they would work.  I asked why they advertized that it would read .pdf and .epb.  He said, well, most of the time it reads them.

Also, it is rather slow so it doesn't seem to be working at full speed. Still, it's really nice to have all that space!
The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.
-has basically all plug adapters you need built-in or easily removable.
6209	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	good cable @ $6, flexible but the ends are a little large
The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.
7309	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	What more can you say. It works like expected. The cable didn't appear to be cheaply made and all hardware interfaced using the cable worked perfectly.

Minuses:
I purchased one book and started reading immediately, after 4 days, suddenly the e-ink screen went darker. The device comes with one year warranty, I took it to the store and they replaced it in 5 minutes, again, the store experience was great.
Save yourself the time and aggravation with this pair, spend the money on a nice Audio-Technica unit (like I'm going to do) and get something that meets your needs for the long haul.

2293	Electronics_5	NEG	1.0	I always try to write good reviews but these headphones are absolutely the cheapest and worthless thing I have ever purchased. The headphone piece broke off as soon as I took them out of the box, and soon after the cord came right apart from a connection on the wire where it splits to go to the earphones. Basically the thing disintegrated right in my hands. Granted, it was for a cheap price but I would at least expect it to hold together for a while before completely breaking apart.

5199	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	I have had my GPS for about a year now, and love it, but i have 2 problems with it, the interface is very difficult to use and tedious to search for a city or road.  By the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another 20 miles.  Also, mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload.  So i downloaded the latest patch for it, and tried uploading with no success.

While high bias tapes are not the absolute best for recording from CDs (metal bias tapes are), they are a big step up from normal bias tapes.  I have used these Maxell tapes for about 15 years for everything from voice recordings, to sound effects, to music.  About 10 years ago I started getting into CD burning for some of my music needs, including burning my own original music from tapes onto CD through the computer, but I still use these Maxell tapes to this day for certain things.

Good purchase.
92	Electronics_5	POS	4.0	Would love to give it 5 stars, but the ONE and only thing missing from this is that the charging indicator light doesn't work.  The biggest positive about this is that the connection to the Nook itself, is MUCH more "beefy" than the standard Nook charging cable.  B&N should have to supply each and every Nook owner with one of these free of cost due to their incredibly poor design of the standard cable that comes with the unit itself.  This is at least the fourth charger cable we have bought and I am hoping that it is the last.
4 months later and it is still doing the job. Plenty of room for content: apps, songs and video and still happy with my device. No problems or concerns to report.

the extra disk player which is a very good machine. I had some minor problems with one slot and I was assured the cleaner would take care of it. I never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything. I am afraid to put it in anything for fear I won't be able to get it out again. I don't know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesn't work with.
1485	Electronics_5	POS	5.0	My experience with this device has been nothing but wonderful. The battery life is amazing once you tweak with the settings (ie, turning off wifi, adjusting screen brightness and duration or sleep mode...) the touchscreen can be less than hyper responsive at times but it doesn't get in the way of reading at all and wiping it off with my sleeve always gets it working again. I love that it can be updated without much effort and the library management system that barnes and noble uses is quite good.

Bear in mind when you purchase flash memory cards that "4GB" is, of course, 'technical' gigabytes, as opposed to 'real' gigabytes, so when you format the card, you will end up with less space than 4GB available on it.
