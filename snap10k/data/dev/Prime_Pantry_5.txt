One of the problems I've always had in making and serving tacos is that it's hard to keep the shells upright so they can be filled easily. Well, this solves the problem. Because they have a flat bottom they stand up without tipping over and you can fill them without half of what you're trying to put into the shells falling out. And, of course, these shells have the same crispness and great taste of the other varieties of Old El Paso shells. I imagine I'm going to be using these from now on.

5295	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	2.0	Has a weird fake taste. Love the jasmine and I usually love mint, so I figured this would be a winner. My whole family agrees this one tastes icky. My daughter grows mint out front (it's her baby) and adding that to tea is wonderful, but this one is not tase-tea at all. Get the jasmine, that is really good! Lemongrass is a step down from the jasmine one. The straight green tea is a bit more bitter than them all.

They are partially coated with a powder that has no real taste, if anything its just the tapioca starch. The chews themselves are semi-hard at first and then when you begin to chew they soften up and become VERY chewy. Like stick to your teeth for 15 minutes chewy. But it's not bad if you're careful about making sure it doesn't stick to your teeth for too long. I just tend to play with the stuck pieces until they pop off and I get another yummy bit of ginger :)

Lea & Perrins The Original Worcestershire Sauce is the gold standard of Worcestershire sauces. The bottle I am looking at has an expiration date of 03/28/2013, but I just pulled it from the cupboard, opened it, and it still tasted fine. Worcestershire Sauce has the benefit of adding to the flavor of a grilled steak, without masking the taste of a grilled steak. The taste is a lot less sweet than the Lea & Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce, and the Lea & Perrins Premium Blend Steak Sauce, both of which use High Fructose Corn Syrup instead of cane sugar. The Worcestershire Sauce lists 1g of Carbohydrates (1g Sugar), while the Traditional Steak Sauce lists Total Carbohydrates 5g (Sugars 3g). The Premium Blend does not list the amount of Sugars, but it still tastes a lot sweeter than the Worcestershire Sauce. The tiny bit of sugars in the thinner Worcestershire Sauce gives a hint of sugar without the candy sweetness of the two mentioned heavy steak sauces. Purist human carnivores even prefer making do with a little salt and black pepper on their steak. The BEST BY date is stamped in black ink on the wrapper, just below the label. The product information as listed on the Worcestershire Sauce label:

9389	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I got this product on the recommendation of a friend. I tried it on a blood stain that had been washed and dried several times and it got the stain out. I soaked the stain for a while (couple minutes) and scrubbed the spot with a firm tooth brush. The stain didn't come out after the first wash, so before drying the item I treated it again, applied the product, scrubbed with a tooth brush and let the item sit overnight. After the next washing the stain was completely gone. Also, my son left a red crayon in his pocket that I washed and dried. There was red crayon on everything. These were dark clothes with red streaks and spots on them from the crayon. I applied the product and scrubbed the spots with a tooth brush and the crayon came out. I can't even tell that these things ever had crayon on them now. This spray n wash works for me!!!

I like to add raisins, pecans, butter, cream and either maple syrup or brown sugar for extra sweetness. These oats a a bit heartier than the quick cook, but not as hearty as Steel Cut.  Although a container is shown in the product images, this is actually two separate bags of oats that I would suggest transferring to a air tight container once each is opened.  Done that way they will stay fresher longer and will be easier and less messy to measure out.

I mix one part ACV with one part tap water, shake well and use it as conditioner even on the days that I do not shampoo. No commercial conditioner for me. The effects are so immediate that after applying the mix I feel the effects on my hair immediately in the shower. I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with coldest water possible since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water. Insure to keep the mix away from eyes and scrub the mix on the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. I do not shampoo my hair every single day since it damages hair and the natural oil of the hair and the days that I do, I add CO. Ricinoleic acid in CO helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO's omega-9 fatty acids can help. You can apply the CO directly on the whole scalp for few minutes, hours and even a day before washing it off completely with ACV.

"Natural" is the industry code word for no hydrogenated oils, and we always look for it because even "reduced fat" peanut butters have hydrogenated oils if they're not labeled "natural."

Just as yummy as I remember, and my kids love it too. The price was great, expiration is quite a ways out, so no worries there. Boxes were packaged well. Great buy all the way around :-) Fresh products. Very satisfied. I recommend Amazon Pantry. Shipping box is very durable. All goods were neatly packaged and arrived safely and undamaged.

6907	Prime_Pantry_5	NEG	1.0	Upon arrival in my Prime Pantry box I noticed the expiration date was months away. Despite this supposed freshness, these animal crackers had a very odd flavor, not like other animal crackers at all. No one in our household will eat them. I did crush a bunch up to use as a crust for a cheesecake, but they're a waste to buy just for that purpose. I eventually just threw them away. Definitely won't be buying these again. Heck, I couldn't even tell what the stamped animal shapes were supposed to be.

The only time I buy actual limes is if I need the zest for something. What I like even more though, is the size of this bottle. I don't use it daily, so often I have found myself questioning whether a larger bottle in my fridge is still fresh/good, and have often thrown it away almost full because it sat in my fridge for so long. I feel better knowing I have less waste with this smaller size bottle.

These are not the sugar free variety which apparently cause stomach issues (to say the least. The reviews are hilarious!). The flavors are distinctive and very tasty and the consistency is gummy. When frozen, they are obviously hard but quickly melt down and taste even better. I can't buy the big bag anymore because I end up overindulging but the small bags are good for a few different snack attacks. These are best gummy bears I have ever eaten and I am a gummy candy connoisseur!

7230	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I love this product I bought for the first time as usually I buy Caldrea; Meyer's dish soap is much less expensive and knowing the lemon verbena scent and the product efficiency are the same than Caldrea, I might buy this one from now on. You only need a small quantity of soap to wash your plates, it is very economic. I have been using it for one week and I cook a lot, which means I have a lot of tools to wash by hand; the soap bottle diminished only 1 cm which corresponds to 0.39 inches. It eliminates the grease depot on your plates easily and I even poured and gently rubbed a small quantity of this soap containing bark extract on a tablecloth stain before washing it: it removed the stain without damaging the tablecloth. That is what I call a good investment!!!

I also make fresh Indian chutneys with these, as well as the standard "trail mix" that includes nuts.  If I get a sweet tooth after dinner, I can grab a few of these and staves off the desire for that cheesecake.  I wish the lid fit better, as the container is made out of a thin, wax coated cardboard.  I may get a glass container with a solid lid so that I can keep these fresh longer.

2794	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	These little bowls of fruit are delicious and so convenient. I am not thrilled about making plastic trash, but at least they are recyclable  They are absolutely perfect to put in a lunch box, and it is so important to increase the amount of fruits and vegetables my kids eat. They really like them and I know they eat them at school because they ask for them when they are at home too. Especially around 4'30 when dinner is not until 6;00. They are only 90 calories and have 1gm of fiber. This is one snack I am happy to give them, especially since they are packed in fruit juice. The price on prime is cheaper then I have seen them for at the supermarket. It's win-win

As advertised, there's no need to stir, but palm oil will float to the top if it were to sit for a prolonged period of time. The peanut butter will still remain the same consistency and the oil formation is probably a good thing since you can dump out the fat content without changing the taste/texture of the product

Grandma and I felt they were not in need of salt or butter. They of course are instant potatoes so they aren't has healthy as making your own.

The grains stay separate rather than getting all stuck together like with starchy white rice. And because it has the bran type covering intact, it's a good source of fiber. I usually cook it in my rice cooker and it comes out perfect every time.

Just make sure you store the opened bag in a proper container to keep it dry and cool, and make sure to bring the yeast up to room temperature before throwing it into the bread machine. This is a very economical way to buy yeast. If it's too much for you, split the bag between you and a friend. I find I have to cut back on the amount of yeast in bread machine recipes; for example, 1 1/2 tsps means I'll use 1 1/4. This yeast seems a lot more active, so I find I need less.

This made a nice alternative, and he loves the taste (so do I but I don't sneak it). I just wish it had more protein. In regular/lactose free milk you get 8 grams per cup, and this only has 1. You'd think something made with nuts would have more, right? Oh well. At least it's got that one, and we make up for it when he's home with the other milk. Cheaper here than Walmart as well, which was 4 for $4. Yay for the 20% off our regular grocery stuff, Amazon!
1044	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	I actually use this to clean windows.  Learned this trick from commercial window washer guys.

766	Prime_Pantry_5	POS	5.0	If you use a lot of oats. . . then this is the way to go.  For either pounds worth (128oz) thats a lot of oats!  At the current price, its under a buck per-pound, so a great buy.  This listing is for Old Fashioned whole oats.  Quaker also offers a large box in quick oats, if you prefer.  Personally, I prefer the whole, old fashioned oats for their consistency. Also, whole, old fashioned oats is what you use when making your own granola bars and such.  If you want wonderful creamy oatmeal, then use milk instead of water.  For one portion bring one cup of milk to a boil.  Add  cup of hole oats.  Return to a boil.  Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for five minutes. . . stirring constantly.  Because of using milk, you must stir constantly, so that it doesnt scorch. .  but its worth it.  ..  tastes so much better then water.

Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."
