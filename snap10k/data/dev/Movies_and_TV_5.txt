Along the way we see that there is more to Speed than greed and impulsive recklessness; more to Poe than his ancestry ("the great Edgar Allen") and his love of opium, and more to Chaney than good fists that he'd just as soon not use.

The film remains a classic.  Some of the night scenes (especially on the country road set) look like they didn't transfer well (i.e. grainy and faded blacks).  And I'm not a fan of the 1980's "inside the mothership" ending.  I'm glad it is gone on this version.

I have been a fan of the genre, ever since I saw "The Omen" back in 1976.  If you like these types of movies, you should also check out "Revelations".  This movie, "The Seventh Sign" is not as good, in my opinion as The Omen, Omen II, Omen III:Final Conflict, and Revelations.  However, it is well-made and the acting performances were very good.  Perhaps one of the most solid performances from Demi Moore in her career.  Michael Biehn and Jurgen Prochnow also lend their talents here.
5238	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	All the so called 'hype' this movie has generated is warranted and then some:nothing quite compares to it.  Something, to put it mildly, just went right.  The claustraphobic atmosphere of meaninglessness, alienation and pure depravity that Scorsese creates is nothing less than perfect. The all consuming glow of streetlamps, traffic signals and headlights allow us to see New York City as Travis sees it, a crowded hell where human being is separated from human being and 'survival of the fittest' is the brutal norm. De Niro's performance is beyond exceptional, it is transcendent.  He absolutely becomes Travis Bickle, a very lost and lonely young war veteran in a city full of people who seem to be asleep. For all intents and purposes, Robert De Niro no longer exists within the running time of this movie:indeed, he so good as Travis that he is sometimes much more frightening than the 'scum', like Harvey Keitel, that his character despises so much. If you've ever felt alone or marginalized in your life, this movie will immediately strike a deep chord with you.  I disagree, however, with interpreters who think that we are supposed to hate and revile Travis and see him as a sick, 'crazed loner' looking for any excuse to satiate his bloodthirsty rage. I would say that, on the contrary, Scorsese's timeless masterpiece is a work of the deepest empathy and compassion.  Travis Bickle is every man and woman who has felt abandoned and lost in a dark and seemingly insane world.  His self perceived 'moral superiority' is indeed a narcissistic delusion and a defense mechanism, but his feelings of rage and hatred toward a blind and sick society are very real and well founded indeed. I was hard pressed to find much optimism or hope in this movie, and our hero (or anti hero) is as sick and irretrievably lost at the end as he is at the beginning. It is basically a work of alarming pessimism and desperation, similar in many ways to George Orwell's "1984". Any lover or student of film should buy this movie without hesitation.

While "Apocalypse" plays out like a mix of "Charlie's Angels" and the "Dawn Of The Dead" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well. While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that "Apocalypse" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel. For all of its faults, if you're looking for a big mindless celebration of action and violence with cheesy dialouge and little of anything else, this could be your cup of tea.
But look, the real delight here is the way Paul Anderson, cinematographer Johnson, and composer Marilyn Manson all work together to play out their gory magic on a palette of silence. Can you beat the scene where the Red Queen is first shut down, the blast doors all slide open, and there is that palpable hiss against the tomb-like quiet of the Hive---and then the groans of the shuffling, shambling, *very* hungry dead? Or when, after a second's reprieve, the survivors cower in a control room from an undead bio-engineered abomination, hungry to get in, pounding at a bulkhead blast-door? The movie is at its best when it is a series of gorgeous shifts from dead quiet to blood-thirsty crescendo.

As with many comedy movies, this one will appeal to people that enjoy a certain kind of humor.  English humor is considered "dry" by American standards.  For "dry" you may read subtle.

Other jokes are wonderfully ironic and require little more than an open mind and a broad sense of humor (think about the killer rabbit).

"SLC Punk" documents all of this with a feverish style. The film is narrated entirely by our main protagonist Stevo, brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Lillard. This was the Reagan era, in which a movement to return to old values and traditions alienated the seeds of Woodstock. The styles of punk however, were eventually as rigid as a Southern frat house, and this is noted in "SLC Punk."
Considering the current lock down of our rights in society, (fingerprinting and computerized mugshots at every border airport) and due process dwindling at an alarming rate; genetic science becoming society's sole judge and executioner in our courts of law; and genetic science itself moving ahead in leaps and bounds without true and productive debate about the ethical implications, the world of Gattaca is almost upon us. As the film states at the beginning, "In the not so distant future.", is a frightening reality we must consider. This is an important film that should not be ignored.

The performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail.

The film is unique in showing Joan of Arc more as the political puppet that she was in real life and how she became a liability after the crowning of the Dauphin in Orleans. The film also shows Joan as a person suffering from a dissociative disorder rather than being a divine messenger. John Malcovich and Faye Dunaway play their roles well as the Dauphin and the Regent Queen. Mila Jojovich is the worst performance in the film and, with her being the main character, the quality of the whole film is reduced to below average.

The Holy Grail was filmed with modest production values, but the Blu-ray picture quality is surprising, showing greatly improved colors and details. Although not the type of film one watches for reference quality video, it is nonetheless very pleasant to take in all the hilarious nonsense with a better picture. Numerous special features are offered on the Blu-ray, mostly ported over directly from the two-disc DVD edition. Like most Python productions nothing is taken too seriously, not the characters, nor the sets and costumes, and certainly not the story. But this casual appearance should not hide the fact that these guys are seriously funny, their stories endearing, their films memorable. King Arthur decides at one point that they will not return to Camelot just now, because it is "a silly place". Holy Grail is a silly movie, and it should be visited early and often in hope of finding still further silliness.

4.  "Silent Movie" (1976) This was an OK movie for me = 3 stars. Living up to its name, there really are no voices in this movie, only sound effects with captions for dialogue. It feels like a TV show, rather than a movie. But I did like Marcel Marceau's cameo.

I really enjoyed this movie, watching for a second time last night.  The picture has a very texturized feel, with the subdued lighting, immaculate sets and costumes giving the entire movie a very `noir' quality.  The story was very well laid out, allowing for rich development of the main characters, creating a real interest and empathy for me for the proceedings on the screen.  Ethan Hawke and Jude Law played their roles wonderfully, one as the struggling `inferior' with dreams that reach beyond his genetic make-up, and the other as the spoiled near-perfect specimen forced to deal with a physical infirmity due to fate, one that couldn't be corrected for with pre-natal DNA manipulation.  Followed up with a strong supporting cast including Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, and Elias Koteas, we are presented with a very plausible science fiction tale, one that may cause you to give some thought and provoke conversation on the concept of human messing around in Mother Nature's domain.

Simple put, while I'm skipping over tons of information here, Demi has to sacrifice someone for her baby to live.  It's really sophisticated and though the story was confusing to follow at times, I never seemed to get *too* lost.  The atmosphere, characters and writing continued to impress me the entire time, and with heavy emphasis on Exorcist-style religious scriptures in the writing which is an easy comparison to make, I'd say the Seventh Sign is a fantastic movie but on a slightly lesser scale than the Exorcist in creepiness, atmosphere and writing, but then again the Exorcist is a horror classic so it would be really hard to out-do that movie.  It comes close though.  Great movie.

You aren't reading this to hear if you want to see the movie, but  if you want to buy the DVD, so I'll review the DVD and this International  version which is different from the American version shown in theaters.  The picture quality is good especially the battle scenes and landscapes  although in somewhat dim scenes the background did not have a lot  definition which I don't remember from the theater. The sound quality was  fine.  I'll break down the difference from the International version with  the American theater release version one by one and my own take them.

Directed by the great Martin Scorsese, this is the story about a man named, Travis Bickle.  He cannot sleep so he decides to be a taxi driver by night.  From his job he has seen the worst of the worst, and every day he seems to be losing his mind.  He turns psychotic every day and it only gets worse.  It eventually gets to the point where Travis wants to kill someone; anyone.  This is a terrifying glimpse into the darkest parts of city life that very few dare to explore.  This is the tale of one man who has had enough.
Still, to make a movie work, you've got to have more than good characters.  And in Bottle Rocket, every factor holds its own.  The film is wonderful to watch on a visual level, with vibrant colors and placeless locations.  The acting is eccentric and genuine, with the subtle and sweet Luke Wilson, and the endearingly pathetic Dignon.  The writing is spot-on, with indrecibly funny one-liners and dry wit spewing out so regularly that you'll need to watch it at least twice to digest all the humor.

3556	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Always great to see the scene shots and filming locations done by Spielberg. This movie embodies his talents in the likes of E.T. and 1941. Great acting and extra scene shots not shown in the original film release.  Richard Dreyfuss never disappoints. Great supporting cast of actors.  Now if only we can all use our smart phones these days with cameras for more opportunities to collect  UFO photos.....hey wait, why doesn't that actually happen?
This is one of the most delightful musicals of recent years. Great performances by Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is outstanding as Ms Hannigan and Tim Curry & Bernadette Peters make convincing nasties. The music is great and the easy-to-miss one-liners are delightful. All-in-all, a must see, and a must-possess movie.
I won't spoil the ending, but I will say this movie really made me smile. It's a great chick flick for those of us who love romance movies.

 Leo McKern portrays this rather simple barrister with a complicated demeanor as no one else can.  Another excellent British Series which I say deserves 5 Stars!
Shrader calls the cab in the movie "a rolling metal coffin."  It's an appropriate metaphor.  Because in the two-perspective ending, we have to wonder if Travis has found the misplaced justification he was looking for when he murders a bunch of lowlives to save a child prostitute - soon after a failed assassination attempt on presidential candidate Pallentine! - from society, or is he simply in his own personal Heaven; we don't see Travis' reflection in the rear-view mirror of his taxi when he adjusts it.

Gloriously staged and photographed (in widescreen Panavision, by Vernon Layton), the movie benefits from glorious location work - exteriors were filmed at the El Tecuan Marina Resort in Mexico - and the shameless deployment of a VERY LOUD soundtrack, while the actors do their best within the limits of their shallow characterizations. Look out for the superb Jeffrey Combs and Bill Cobbs in crucial supporting roles.

4098	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Here is a movie that probably most people can relate to, as its main plot focuses on relationships--& complicated ones at that. This is a movie about real-life situations that will cause a person to take pause for  thought, for sure. The performances by everyone were OUTSTANDING, even  provoking me to tears, & for me, that's a rare happening! I definitely,  highly recommend this one, & without me revealing the plot or other  juicy details, I'll just say it's worth watching, & I very much enjoyed  this one. I've watched it more than once, & know I'll be watching it  again probably several more times sometime in the future. Isn't one you'll  soon forget, as a lot of movies oftentimes are very forgettable.
But the film is great, and is a must see for those who enjoyed the films of the 1970's. Also invaluable is a nice "Eyes on Laura" photo gallery, where a person by the name of Laurent, gives us an inside to the script's changes while they show some great photos. Then the Director's Commentary is wonderful~~~Irvin Kershner talks to you, not AT YOU, just as if you were sitting with him in a living room, relaxing, and he gives you a play by play on the whole movie!!!

The story may be a bit improbable, and the '80's opinions may not be PC, but you forget that once Doug gets into the air, whether in his Cessna or piloting a "borrowed" F-16 and hammering the living daylights out of enemy installations.  Indeed, in a world where American tolerance for military risk seems to diminish with every year that goes by, the movie is the kind that may just reignite your patriotism.  The aerial sequences are fantastic and worth the price in themselves, and whatever you say against Doug's methods, two things you have to grant him: he's brave as a lion, and he's not giving up till he saves his father.  This is a story about courage, family connectedness, friendship, and being willing to risk your future and your life for what you think is right.

The movie starts to track the video game more closely and introduces the Jill Valentine character from the game.  Jill and Alice make a great combo and the production is higher budget with better special effects and more action than the first movie.  There are a couple of really unique action sequences that I have not seen done before.  The entire key is to accept the premise of the movie and understand that the story and character development is mostly a backdrop to transition between action set pieces.
It's a touching movie and as far as sci-fi goes, it is, in my opinion, one of the better.

This is one of the funniest movies ever. Those who like this movie will also like John Cleese's series called
Season 4 - Generally regarded by fans as the strongest of the five seasons, with superb acting and cracker storylines.  The season starts off with "A Patriotic Offering" where Lady Prudence (Joan Benham) suggests that Hazel takes in a family of Belgian refugees.  "The Beastly Hun" features an Emmy-winning performance from Gordon Jackson; whilst "If You Were the Only Girl in the World" has Hazel falling in love with a handsome young airman who is later tragically killed in a bombing strike.  The season also introduces us to the charming naval widow Virginia Hamilton (Hannah Gordon), who turns to Richard for help when her oldest son is to be court-martialled.  The season ends on a tragic note when Hazel contracts a severe and dangerous strain of the flu virus just as peace is declared by England.

4834	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	We all need movies, close at hand, that will make us laugh and fall off the chair!!  That is what Mel Brooks does for me.  So if you like funny, spoofy, sometimes silly and filled with inuindos, you will love this collection too.  The description doesn't list it but Young Frankenstein is also in this collection.
Third, the pacing is so terribly slow.  The movie runs just a little over two hours but feels much longer. About 95 minutes would have been sufficient. Some scenes involving Norman's courtship with Jessie (Norman meeting Jessie's family; Norman and Paul taking Jessie's brother Neal fishing) which, while humorous, could have been cut without taking anything away from the movie's core, which is the relationship among Paul, Norman and their father.
I also liked this movie due to its' non-dependence on fact, and its reliance upon various schools of thought. For example, the question of whether God told Jean to lead France to victory is never totally justified. In fact, her `conscience' (played towards the end of the film by Dustin Hoffman) does a fine job in ripping up Jean's ego and exposing her as a scheming egomaniac who had her own self-esteem issues to address, rather than any form of probably divinity. Again, this is alluded to, not stated as fact. In doing so, Besson opens new doors of possible thinking for the audience, and the director presents these alternate realities before us with rare tenderness that has often escaped in the past.
If you can get your computer's DVD player to play Region 2, your system will play the PAL format just fine. If you want to watch this on a traditional DVD player, you will need to either get a region-free player or convert it over to NTSC.

9899	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	"Gattaca" (1997 - 112 minutes) is one of the best scientific fiction movies of the 90 years. Deep, overwhelming and controversial, it was written and directed by Andrew Niccol. Gattaca, the name of a specific DNA strain sequence of the human body, is also the denomination of a space trip megacorporation. The society described in the narrative adopts the genetic manipulation to improve the attributes of each human being. In fact, the people are classified as "valids" [or perfect conceived in laboratory] and "invalids" [conceived by the natural method]. Vincent Freeman [the actor Ethan Hawke] is one of "invalids" having to support his stigma of birth, beyond other imperfections. He has an illness that limits his life to 30 years - in contrast to his younger brother, Anton [Loren Dean], that was designed genetically and is a member of the elite. But Vincent did not accept his destiny. He aims for changing his life and fulfill his dreams, travelling to other planets. To qualify himself as a space pilot, the young one would have to be "perfect" or "valid". As in that society the identity of someone was not confirmed by documents but by their genes, Vincent perceives that he has to turn himself into another person to obtain what he wants. Through a DNA trader, he knows Jerome Eugene Morrow [the actor Jude Law], a superior being that was paralyzed  in an accident and was excluded from the society. Using samples of blood, hair, skin and urine of Jerome, Vincent assumes his identity, becoming a navigator. Vincent also falls in love for the pretty Irene [the actress Uma Thurman], his colleague in Gattaca, that does not know his true identity. One week before the space mission, a murder in Gattaca starts an inquiry led for Anton, that is a policeman. Vincent is in a great danger to be discovered.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Fun fact: In the summer of 1993, 'Last Action Hero' opened one week after 'Jurassic Park.' Studio bosses at Columbia Pictures were convinced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would clobber the dinosaurs, and played up this battle of the box office behemoths in their promotion for the film. They were gravely mistaken. Arnold Schwarzenegger got stomped like Bambi under Godzilla's foot. I can recall going to a big multiplex with Steven Spielberg's film on five screens. Even in its second week, lines to see it went through the theatre lobby and out the door. In comparison, 'Last Action Hero' opened there on just a single screen with a half-empty auditorium. After a string of mega-hits including 'Total Recall' and 'Terminator 2,' the actor had his first outright flop. As a potential contender for the big summer blockbuster of the year, 'Last Action Hero' was simply not to be.

It's a poetic piece which meant a lot to us when we saw it. Regrettably, there were wrongs with that America and Fonda and Hopper were subtle enough to point some of them out without being too heavy handed. They let us see the South they saw and listen to the rather haunting words of Nicholson.

Oldman films using the now-traditional and all-too-common (but at the time, novel) hand-held camera technique and 16mm film, thus giving "Nil By Mouth" not the look of a polished, slick and lavish film, but raw, unkempt footage of very real life.
That is Susan Seaforth Hayes and Bill Hayes in a real television clip from Days of Our Lives (NBC). As of this writing, they are still on the serial together.
Mixed in with the gunfire and explosions that punctuate the film, Petersen and Marlowe endow their characters with depth and believability.  Petersen makes viewers care about each person being held hostage, warts and all, so that when one is lost,  it feels real.  Even Korshunov is played in such way that his motivations feel true and heartfelt, even if his cause is not just.

Based on a short film that director/co-writer Anderson made in 1994, "Bottle Rocket" tells the story of three 20-somethings who aspire to be thieves.

Cleese, Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Gilliam, and Jones all play multiple roles, combining non-sequitur humor with bloody duels and other pratfalls that parody medieval chivalry and archaic religious sentiment. Somehow, senselessly silly gags like the encounter with a killer rabbit and the Knights Who Say "Ni!" tickle the funny bone no matter how many times you watch. For brilliant, irreverent lunacy, seek the "Holy Grail."

The earlier posts about wanting more gore are a bit disturbing.  WTH?  There's *Plenty* of gore in this movie.  If you didn't think so, I suggest a seriously overdue reality check.

The performances of the cast are delightful - Nicholson's is rightly feted, and Hopper's is very Dennis Hopper - fans of Apocalypse Now will recognise this style in which Hopper doesn't really act so much as simply looning around - here in total contrast to Fonda's studied coolness, which holds the film together, reinforced with a cracking soundtrack (in this regard also, Easy Rider was well ahead of its time).

The famous line, "Are you talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here," spoken to himself in a mirror, has been many times mimiced but the meaning can only be fully realized in this film.

But another thing I'd like to point out is that it's strange now that all these films that have to do with terrorists have an all new meaning and message now in our post-9/11 world.  If you'll recall, Oldman's character was a Russian nationalist who wanted a re-united Russian motherland with the President (played by Jurgen Prochnow, of Das Boot fame) of Kazakstan as the Russian Prime Minister.  Except that he's a renegade that wants to use the old Russian nuclear stockpile to terrorize the free world.  Oldman states how US foreign policy may be beneficial to the US, but it destroys the lives of other countries.  I think he mentions something about the sanctions on Iraq causing undue suffering.  So you see, these old terrorist movies should have been a bit of a wake-up call for us.

7784	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	I was looking at the main title sequence of this film, and maybe it was the DVD release, but why was Elmer Bernstein credited as doing the music, when even the back of the box says that Mark Isham did the music?  When I saw the film on VHS, they had the correct information, but why was the DVD incorrect?  Are other releases of this film on DVD providing the same incorrect information, or actually listing Isham as the composer.  What made the issue even more ridiculous is how the end credits had Isham's regular orchestrator and conductor, Ken Kugler, and Bernstein always conducted his own scores by this time period.  Please, will anyone explain this discrepancy?  On the whole though, bad film, but beautiful cinematography.  However, Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn were extraordinary.

Not to mention that the worst and most brutal one was played by the very American Paul Smith.  There wasn't a real Turk in the pack.
I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.

Well I am astounded to announce that, Blu-Ray fans won't be disappointed in this department either because the picture and sound looks and feels incredibly sharp, precise and most importantly very consistent. Despite the film's age, this disc completely revives and revamps it to a more recent looking film even with the sparse and light 90's grain subtlety prevalent throughout. Fortunately, this minor set back hardly retracts or dilutes any of the overall quality of this pristine transfer. More importantly, flesh tones are smooth and detailed throughout; hair and fabric emit some fine detail particularly in the darker interior shots of the control panel sequences. The blue colored control panel scenes are quite remarkable in the sense that it really enhances facial hair and flesh tone depth to a more elevated level of clarity in any parts of the film. Personally, no other scene compares to this high level of detail in my opinion. This attribute is more specifically shown when Gary Oldman is losing his patience when he frustratingly articulates his demands to the vice president with impunity and anger. Apart from the control panel scenes, the rest of the film does not fail to deliver in expressing some vibrantly smooth scenes in the conference rooms, bag storage area as well as the smaller private rooms (Bathroom, lounge rooms). The majority of the film takes place in the interior of the plane during the night with some interwoven scenes of the white house conference rooms so you will have to keep this in mind in order to regulate any misguided expectations. (In terms of settings, not an entire amount of variety here)

The real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries.

But that doesn't matter. The true strength of this film is its ability to draw from these conventions and make it turn and twist on themselves.

Overall "Resident Evil - Apocalypse" gets 75% according to my percentage system. It's fun and entertaining but is extremely far fetched in some cases (an example of this is when Alice arrives in the nick of time to save Valentine (et al) by smashing through a stained-glass window on a motorcycle, then landing and back-flipping off. The bike then ramps and she fires to shots that hit the gas tank, causing the bike to combust and killing some of the long tongued creatures. I'm sorry, she may be super, but that's a steaming pile of goat s***) and is flawed in many places. Don't get me wrong, I'll watch it again, but it's no classic and certainly not totally well done. And if you think that's wrong, ask a stuntman to backflip off a bike, ramp it and blow it up without killing himself. I rest my case. So it's a cool film, but nothing I would call special. Buy if you like, it's a 50-50 for me...
The young Jane was fantastic with her willful impestuousness. Samantha Morton brought spunk and humor to her character and I found it refreshing.

Every scene is dynamic cinematically and the title sequence is just great.

Thank goodness, because it fits just perfectly here and I could not imagine another song in its place. Get this movie, you will not be disappointed. I loved every minute of it.

However, the movie has some flaws. It actually makes sense to bar physically unqualified people from becoming astronauts, though just a gene test as depicted in this movie is not enough and is not a good standard to use; there should be actual physical tests. I'm actually not sure if Vincent is fit enough; on the one hand, his heart couldn't withstand long running, but on the other hand, Vincent could swim faster and farther than Anton. If he's not physically qualified, he can still get closer to his dream by becoming an astronomer or aerospace engineer; heart disease and myopia won't make one inferior in those two jobs. Even if he's not intelligent enough to be an astronomer or aerospace engineer, he can still be an artist who designs the aesthetic aspects of the spaceship and spacesuits; that's much better then being a janitor. Another point I want to make is, if I'm the director's theology professor, then I'll give him a fail. But perhaps I missed the point here; perhaps the point he tried to make is that genetic determinism, by ignoring the fact that there's no gene for the human spirit, turns people into spiritually dead callous machines.

I don't find it funny when the characters repeatedly take Christ's name in vain, as though His name were a common curse word.  I know I sound like Annell, but she was right.  It's wrong, and it's insulting to everyone who holds Christ dear.  And telling people to shove their Bibles where the sound doesn't shine is equally as insulting.  People honestly don't realize what they're doing.  Be glad most Christians aren't violent about such things (as I am not violent, either)!
6569	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics.

After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money. I'll never understand how such talented actors and such a large budget can create such disposable junk. Avoid this movie at all costs. Consider yourself warned.

There are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.

Dennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.

Immediately, only seconds after popping this DVD into your hardware and hitting the "play" button, something is going to strike you as a little bit odd. Something's different about this classic, but it's tough to put your finger on it until the murky opening scenes are in the past. Bluntly enough, this new restoration looks BREATHTAKING. One of the toughest things to endure about the film's earlier VHS incarnations was the god-awful quality of the video, the way everything had been overtaken by a sort of yellowish-brown hue, darkened and muddied. However, this most recent DVD release cleans up those long-standing visual stains with uncanny precision, revealing in its wake an entirely new motion picture. Wide shots of the infamous "Trojan rabbit" scene are awesome sights, now that the original color saturation is in place. It's honestly as though someone took a cloth and some Windex to my television screen and wiped away thirty years' worth of dust and muck. The restoration alone is worth upgrading the copy of Holy Grail in your collection from VHS to DVD.

1833	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderfully done made-for-cable movie about George Washington and his famous victory at the Battle of Trenton in the winter of 1776.  Starring Jeff Daniels as General Washington, this film brings an important episode in American history vividly to life.  We see the broken remnants of the Continental army as it races to avoid capture following their defeats in New York.  The British, close on the heels of the retreating rebels, have written the Americans off as being on the verge of total surrender. Washington, tired and beaten, realizes that he must make one last attempt to achieve victory or all hope for the revolution will be lost.  Against the judgement of his officers, Washington prepares to launch a desperate offensive against a large force of Hessian troops occupying the town of Trenton, just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. The future of the new United States hangs in the balance as the rag-tag army bets all or nothing on this dangerous gamble.  Well written and with money well-spent, The Crossing is a dramatic telling of this important moment in American history, and one that I would recommend to teachers, students, and history enthusiasts alike.

6450	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	In only her second directorial effort (after "Yentl"), Barbra Streisand proves to be a masterful storyteller with an almost exaggerated romantic sensibility and an unfettered preoccupation with psychoanalysis.  She obviously found the perfect vehicle in Pat Conroy's epic novel about Tom Wingo, a Southerner whose failing marriage and career reflect a deep suppression of an abusive childhood, the memories of which are triggered by his twin sister's suicide attempt. That the story revolves around a man's personal crisis versus a woman's may strike some as odd given Streisand's particularly female perspective, but she actually makes Tom's complex personal journey resonate with greater sensitivity as a result. In fact, the emotionalism Streisand invests in her musical performances is very much in evidence here, and her lush, almost Baroque style fits the contours of this soap opera very well.

Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.

1263	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	In the Nineties it was fashionable for Hollywood to adapt popular television series for the big screen the best being "The Fugitive" and the very worst, in my mind, "Lost In Space".  There were high hopes riding on "The Avengers" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited "The Avengers" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.  It's rare that I do a 180 on a film but that's the case here.  This film may have its detractors but if you go into it with an open mind you may find delight in "The Avengers".

7610	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I was surprised at how good this film was and how creepy it was in parts. Faye Dunaway gives a fairly polished performance as the renowned but fragile photographer Laura Mars who has the uncanny ability to recreate (using live models) violent crime scenes that have taken already place. This ability does not escape the attention of a local police officer, John Neville played by Tommy Lee Jones in an early acting role. The relationship between John and Laura is both tender and brittle. Both are damaged people with secrets to hide and both fear exposure of the truth behind Laura's gift of second-sight. There is a good cast, such as Rene Auberjonois and Brad Dourif but they have minor roles, these were days before Deep Space Nine and Star Trek - Voyager. A spooky, thoughtful little movie with good camera work, vivid splashes of color and a funky 1970s sound track to accompany it.

The DVD picture quality is great.  I can only recall seeing roughly four or five tiny specs of film deterioration during the entire film.  The colors and sharpness are fantastic and the stereo sound is excellent too.  The making of the movie bonus feature is very insightful as a lot of details about the motorcycles, the production and background of the film are brought to light.  Dennis Hopper also gives audio commentary for the main feature.
2) The only special feature is a very worthwhile 25-minute documentary about the actual historical events surrounding Joan of Arc's life. It would have been good to to have even more background information on this fairly complicated story.
 The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs "family". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their "upstairs" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both "families", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.
and you also get the different Theatrical release versions of the film
Within the madness and mayhem, certain scenarios allow larger issues to be argued; dualities discussed include punks vs. hippies, violence vs. peace, "real" punks vs. poseurs, chaos vs. structure, and anarchy vs. fascism. Some very good questions are both implicitly and explicitly asked, such as "Does violent anarchism become fascism when it seeks to impose its value systems on others?"
The movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, "You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!" The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.
The special features on the disc are average. There's a very interesting and highly deatailed making of the film, with all the people who were involved in the making of the film, Scorsese, Schrader, Keitel, Foster, Shepherd, Brooks, and ofcourse De Niro. The documentry is 70 minutes long, but is a great way to find out the details of what went into the film. Other features include: a trailer, interactive full script of the film, this means you can change to the movie and back to the script to see what they changed and what they kept. Advertising material, like posters and promotional stuff. Sadly there's no commentry but the documentary itself is worth a watch with the film. The film: 5/5, the extra: 3/5.

-Visually stunning.  Pay attention to how color (and the lack of) is used.
The rich colors of the Chapman-trasnfer is not on the DVD. The color looks a  bit desaturated and often off-balanced. For instance, in daylight interior scenes like the lelection campaign office,  what you see outside the windows are simply too blue. It looks more contrasty and  you loose certain details in the shadow area.  But I do not dislike this  transfer: while the Chapman-trasnfer makes Travis' Urban Hell look a bit  sexier, Hell's Kitchen in this version is tough, gritty and merciless. The  desaturation of colour employed on the notorious "blood bath"  sequence is more effective in this transfer (By the way, Chapman himself disliked the effect, so apparently he tried to minimize it on his supervised trasnfer). If you have the chance to see  the film on screen with a good print, the effect is devastating (Scorsese  applied the same technique in Bringing Out the Dead, this time throughout  the entire picture) .

Don't even try to work together to kill this man. I guess if you have common sense horror movies won't exist.
6196	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This is not a horror movie.  This film does not compare well with horror movies.  This is an action movie with zombies.  It compares very well with other action movies.  Starting where Resident Evil ended, the bullets start flying and the zombies start chomping immediately (do watch RE before this one).  Although the script is hardly award winning, the movie delivers much more than you would reasonably expect from a video game based zombie movie.  The actors are capable enough, and even if you find them stiff and generic, it's okay - most of them don't survive very long.  Sadly, the comedy relief guy isn't funny at all and he does survive the whole movie.  Also, the martial arts and special effects are good overall (except for the CGI Dobermans which are awful).  Somehow the film avoids being predictable and sets up the last part of the trilogy nicely.  Whether or not you've played the video game (I haven't), Resident Evil: Apocalypse is sure to satisfy cravings for a fast-paced action movie with sexy, gun-toting, butt-kicking babes if you can forgive a few rather forced script elements (like main characters strolling through a graveyard totally oblivious to the risk this involves during a zombie uprising!)

The storylines of the various "The Avengers" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity... in fact, it actually went "sci-fi" in some episodes. This did not diminish my love for the "The Avengers" because the overall series always manifested a "Batman" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it.

If you're going to upgrade to Blu-Ray and want to learn the history behind "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", it's highly recommended you buy the 30th Anniversary box set. However, if you just want to buy "Close Encounters" primarily for the picture and audio quality and have no care for the extras, the "Blu-Ray Essentials" version will serve you well. It also helps that it's much cheaper than the other set (at least, at this moment).
The supporting cast is strong, with Shepherd, Foster and Keitel all playing their parts well. You'll also see Peter Boyle and Albert Brooks. One of the most surprising scenes involves a cameo from Scorsese. His character might even be the catalyst for the change which eventually occurs in Bickle.
1548	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre.  I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'

6208	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	"Resident Evil" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparant deaths of hundreds of employees;  at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandoes.  Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the "Resident Evil" series of video games.

450	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	One of the best-done Bible movies ever, if not the very best.  I'm a pastor.  Great acting; great story telling.  Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness.  The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.  I wish Christians, in making Biblical movies, would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film.  Bravo!  I love this movie.
Nicholson cheerfully agrees to go along with them on their Harley sojourn.  Along the way, Hopper complains to him about how he and Fonda are constantly harrassed by the law and unable to get even a "second rate motel" to sleep in.  Nicholson gingerly explains to the pair that it's not just the length of the hair that bothers people; it's what they represent--individual freedom: "They'll talk to you and talk to you about freedom, but when they see someone with real freedom, it's gonna scare them."  One night, Louisiana rednecks savagely beat and kill Nicholson.  It is at this point that EASY RIDER starts getting bleaker in tone.
Films that thoroughly satisfy are BONNE & CLYDE, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, BETTY BLUE, BASIC INSTINCT, and CHICAGO, and they all achieve masterpiece status in my pantheon. Not that others don't (e.g., MY FAIR LADY). But these are the films, one per decade, that I've placed highest on my altar.

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this "Set No. 4" color-coded RED), is the fourth of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of "The Avengers" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front.

5249	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Travis Bickle is one of the most confused and violent characters ever to grace the screen.  He is an ex-marine who becomes a taxi driver.  He is disgusted by all the filth and scum he sees in New York City, but he drives in the city's worst neighborhoods and picks up the slimiest of characters.  In voice overs, we hear him describe some of the debauchery that goes on in his cab.  He sees a beautiful young woman working in the campaign offices of a Presidential candidate.  He gets up the nerve to ask her out and they go to a luncheonette and have a nice conversation.  Then on another date he takes her to a pornographic movie and she is revolted by this and then spurns him.  One of the heartbreaking scenes in the movie is Travis calling her on a pay phone to apologize.  Martin Scorcese pans away from Travis and shows a long corridor while he is being rejected.  This sends Travis over the edge.  He gets a mohawk and plans an assassination attempt on the candidate which is aborted.  He also meets a 13 year old hooker named Iris.  He can't understand why she subjects herself to this life and why she is with a creepy pimp named Sport.  In the film's bloody climax, Travis kills Sport and ends up in a blood bath while Iris looks on horrified.  Robert De Niro plays Travis as powderkeg waiting to burst.  He lets Travis slowly slide into his own personal hell before finally exploding.  Cybil Shepard is charmingly beautiful as the campaign worker and Albert Brooks provides some levity as her co-worker.  Jodie Foster served noticed as Iris.  She plays the character with seeming self-assurance, but with an underlying fragility an amazing achievement for the then 13 year old.  Peter Boyle plays Wizard, who doles out philosophies on life to Travis, with an all-knowing nature.  Harvey Keitel plays Sport with the right amount heavy handiness and smarm.  The film established Martin Scorcese as a top-flight director.



The episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD's in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn't get much better than this. I urge all Up/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself. Don't miss it.

1) "The Danger Makers" sees a high-ranking ex-serviceman seeking to feed their high threshold for adventure.  The banter between Steel and Mrs. Peel sharpens to double entendres that trademarks their pairing.
However, events take a darker turn through intolerance. They just aren't welcome because they have long hair and are unshaven. Jack Nicholson, who plays an alcoholic civil rights lawyer, observes that it's fear and, maybe, jealousy of their free lifestyle. Nicholson gives a good performance and isn't the caricature that he later became. Eventually, the two bikers experience a bad acid trip and, finally, a senseless shooting.

1684	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced.  With sixty-eight 50-minute episodes, the series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, and on into the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.

Travis takes Betsy a girl who works for the Senators cmpaign on a date. After an awful night at the movies Travis goes in and tries to talk to her about why she wasn't returning his calls.

Harrison Ford plays the president who after making it clear to the world he will never negotiate with terrorists falls victim to a terrorists hijack of Air Force One! The president is pressed to the ultimate limit when his wife and daughter are held hostage by a Russian goon (Played so deliciously by Gary Oldman)! With the fates of the world & his family both hanging in balance, it up to the president to kick some butt. Although the dialog & action is 100% macho, some of the CGI effects for Air Force One leave much to be desired. When you see the end of the movie, you'll know what I mean! Still it has heart and attitude which makes it out to be a true action classic!
 Billy is a loner who can't wait to get out of almost every place that he and Wyatt visit. It's the sense of family, and community, that Billy doesn't feel comfortable with.

They share a lot of laughs about the movie while they discuss what was done to create each scene that flickers across the screen. This is actually fun,enjoyable commentary even though the commentators are talking about a dreary,dreadful enterprise. The other audio commentary features members of the visual effects team, and as expected, this is a technicalminded and occasionaly boring track if you're not a total tech wonk.

Harrison portrays one of the best examples for a Hollywood President in a long time, very straight forward and to the point. He's ex military, so when Gary Oldman hijacks the plane, the president is forced to rely on his training and save the day. But its not quite that simple.
Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.  I would have given this movie 4 stars if based totally on the story, but I've given this version 5 stars based on the rich acting of both the lead actors (especially Hinds), they are wonderful.
A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay.

Now, granted, that may not sound like much given the ineptitude of films like Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, but it is a genuinely good horror film by any standards, and has its share of creepy atmosphere and flesh-munching zombies (and worse). Sure it employs a predictable soundtrack of techno and metal riffs, but it's appropriate enough here.

I was not living in North America at the time and saw it while on vacation from Britain. I'd seen no trailers or other publicity, so I came to it with no preconceptions whatever. I found the sense of wonder in the movie and the gradual drawing together of the threads to the climax to be fascinating; and the climax itself, on a giant screen, was awe-inspiring. I've never got quite the same feeling of magic from any other movie. It's 35 years since the movie burst upon the scene and evidence of its influence is still seen in numerous movies (most recently 'Super 8'), but nothing has quite matched the original. It is truly a seminal movie of the genre.

I thought I should clarify this first because there are inconsistencies about the way this particular version is presented on Amazon. For instance, the link for the product says [Region Free] but then on the Product Description it says Region B (won't play on most Blu-ray players in America) but then down below there is another note that says "it will play on American Blu-ray players". The product link says "Blu-ray only" but the sticker on the product image says Blu-ray/DVD Dual copy. I was confused so I called Amazon customer service. Agent, after putting me on brief hold, told me that the item is Region B only and probably won't play on American Blu-ray players. But because I trust Amazon's return policy,  I decided to take the chance and purchase. I thought to myself, if it didn't play I could always return it to Amazon. I am glad I did that. As soon as I inserted the disc to my Blu-ray player (Sony 4K Blu-ray player ubp x800), it played without any issues. My other 4K Blu-ray Player, Samsung UBD-KMC85C also plays it without any issues.

I LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.

"Help, Help, a Shark" (Episode #134) features Jim Backus as General Fitzhugh, the longtime rival of General Schaeffer (Vinton Hayworth), who are competing for a spot in the All-Military Pool Championships.  When Tony ruins Schaeffer's big game his only chance to avoid being sent to the North Pole is to play Fitzhugh in a rematch.  The good news is that with Jeannie on his side, Tony is sure to win.  The bad news is that Fitzhugh refuses to play with a woman in the room.  Of course a large part of the pleasure here is the guest appearance by Thurston Howell III himself, which makes this the best episode of this particular trio.
Along the way they pick up their alcoholic hitchhiker (Jack Nicholson) who is murdered one night in an attack by country bumpkin locals as the guys were sleeping in the woods. The survivors proceed to New Orleans for Mardi gras as planned, and encounter two hookers (notably Karen Black for one), get mind blowingly high, where Hopper shows outstanding camera work and creativity in this masterpiece. Afterwards, moving on, the boys are fatally hasseled by a couple more rednecks, where the movie ends.
The drawback about seeing it on DVD is that, even with today's large-screen TVs, the movie needs a bigger stage to deliver maximum impact. It's still a wonderful film, one which I continue to enjoy after many, many viewings, but I'm so glad my first experience of it was in the theater, totally unprepared for what I was about to see.

There is one downside (and I admit that this is probably nit-picking) but Criterion's CAV laserdisc version was so wonderful since one could program (edit) the movie into what I (!) felt was the ultimate version.  With all 3 versions on the Blu-Ray, frankly, I do not find one to be completely satisfying.  If we only had the original version, there would be no issue; nothing to compare, too.  But, with 3 versions, one sees things that could have been improved to make (what I think) is a true ultimate version.  But, again, alas...

Offered in a hardcover book style with a replica of the original poster artwork as well as photos from the movie. Special features include the 1986 commentary track with Scorsese and Schrader from the Criterion laserdisc, an interactive feature that allows you to compare the script to the movie(the script appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen as you're watching the movie progressing with each new scene). It's interesting to compare the finished movie where the actors and Scorsese alter the dialogue to fit the their interpretation of the characters. We also get new commentary tracks by writer Schrader and Professor Robert Kolker. We also get new featurettes including "God's Lonely Man", "Producing 'Taxi Driver'", "Travis' New York" comparing 1975 to 2006, storyboard to film comparisons with Scorsese's introduction  and Scorsese discussing the making of the film. I didn't access the "Movie I.Q." special feature here.

With my short homage to Dignan being over (for now...), I will say that BOTTLE ROCKET does not fail to live up to Wes Anderson's usual offbeat comedies. Having seen RUSHMORE and THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS before this movie, I was well prepared for the characters in BOTTLE ROCKET to be slightly insane, off-beat and freakishly realistic at the same time. There seems to be a common vein that runs through all of Anderson's lead characters--an insatiable drive towards something that the audience (and other characters) may not be able to grasp until the end. You know going into a Wes Anderson film that you are going to be treated with a rare glimpse of an indiscernible time period where the constraints of reality/normalcy do not exist.

In this case, the author of The Prince of Tides co-wrote the script, so he had every opportunity to make sure that the story he was telling was true to his book, even if it wasn't a blow-by-blow exact replica.
Robert De Niro stars as Travis Bickle, who describes himself as "God's lonely man". He takes a job driving taxis because he can't sleep nights, and if he's going to roam New York City anyway, he might as well get paid for it. From here on out, the movie takes us INSIDE Travis's head. His thoughts, his feelings, his obsessions, his loneliness. This is why, although he is portrayed as a nut, the audience sort of feels for Travis (for the most part anyway). The viewer understands what is making him want to violently lash out at the messed-up world. We witness firsthand why he wants someone to "just flush this city right down the [edit] toilet!"

This an interesting film. It is very anti-Hollywood. There is no real narrative structure to it.

The Fisher King was directed by Terry Gilliam, himself the most manic member of Monty Python, and I think he was the perfect director to work with Williams.

Thought that they would base it on the frist game in the series. If you really wanna know where it fits in the series, it's sort of like a prequel to the events that unfolded. The mansion in the movie is not the one in the game. It takes place at a different mansion but takes place during the first game. This movie left me shocked most of the time what with the countless surprises and consistant 'have to hurry' flow. It's the perfect begining to kick off the series. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is becuase the zombie effects could've been a littl better. But, other than that, that's all. Enjoy!
Susan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.

Fact:  Yes, this movie isn't too close to the storylines in the "Resident Evil" games.  I've played a couple of them, but not much to know the storylines.
However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.

Less well-remembered is Richard Dreyfuss's role as Roy Neary, a man whose life is quite literally torn apart by his encounter and subsequent visions.  Almost unbelievably for a Spielberg film, Neary's marriage does't survive the film (Terri Garr does at least lends unexpected depth to what could have been a thankless role), and we're left wondering if he'll be reunited with his three children -- or if Roy Neary really cares?  The one family scene before his close encounter shows that he's pretty well alienated from his home to begin with.  Was he happy with his life before the flying saucers found him?  Will he ever return to Earth?  What does Spielberg mean by that U.S.S. Enterprise hanging in Roy's living room? :-)

I was absolutely in awe of how all the speakers were being utilized, especially my surround channels  and I also noticed a few times where my subwoofer would utilize low frequency sounds.

3. The ending.  I don't know, it was awe inspiring but at the same time real boring.  There needed to be a climax, and I think Spielberg felt that the aliens showing themselves would be it.  I'd rather they hadn't shown the aliens, that would've been more real.  Think about it, making contact with an entirely different species?  Not real.

Whereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.
Anyway, all ranting aside, this film is highly entertaining very awe-inspiring.

Yes, circling back to the beginning is effective in this case -- but not exactly the beginning -- never exactly the beginning. There has to be a change however subtle, or the circling is meaningless and it is not a real circling.  His hair could have been cut a little different, shorter, something.

Even the finale is very abrupt and undeveloped, and then, that's all folks.  Kind of a wheeze-out for a show that in its prime was the sharpest written sit-com on television and still one of the best of all time.  Season Six is not the place to begin for newbies, but once you've watched this far, you might as well collect 'em all.

The story spins around the controversially provocative  high-fashion photographs shot by  the infamous Laura Mars ( Dunaway looking as hot as the models) and her  murderous preminitions.  Casting  the actual vogue models (and hair and makeup people) who actually participated  in those racy fashion photos at that time  makes it  wonderfully authentic. A  sensational  thriller  that captures that spirit of wild erotic abandon which the high fashion world was totally lost in at that time .  To witness the  outrageous photo-shoot sequences , gorgeous half naked  lingerie-clad models  cat -fighting  in front of  burning cars, models in evening glamour posing with pistols and dead male models-  is worth it alone.

Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.
I understand that Oliver Stone actually wound up apologizing for the film's supposedly "anit-Turk" sentiment.  That's an interesting development.  And a point that can be legitimately debated.  Many years ago, I read the book, and  although I don't recall it all that well, I remember realizing that the film I had seen a few years before was largely-maybe grossly?-fictionalized.  No one expects strict adherence to the facts from a Hollywood dramatization, but of course, when dealing with issues like ethnic bias, the slandering of entire nation, the issue of truthfulness becomes all the murkier.  We all understand screenwriters alter facts, combine personages, and streamline the timeline for dramatic purposes.  We also have little reason to doubt that a Turkish jail (at least a 1970s Turkish jail) may not have indeed been hell on earth  The question is just what circle of hell was it really?
This is a colourful and brash musical entertainment, lifted miles above its kind of turgid elements due to the star power of its lead trio, as well as some knock your socks off arrangements by Sinatra's leading collaborator of that time, Nelson Riddle. Even though Frank Sinatra, Novak and Hayworth are all immensely winning in their roles, the music here is undoubtedly one of the chief allures of this film, and Nelson Riddle's inventive reimagining of these Rodgers and Hart classics are elegant showpieces not just for Frank Sinatra's mature vocalising, but for the art of orchestration itself (actual orchestration duties fell to Arthur Morton). (Neither Rita Hayworth nor Kim Novak did their own singing, not to state the obvious.) This may not be the "real" Pal Joey in any sense of the word, but it still remains one of Frank Sinatra's best screen outings. Frank Sinatra certainly could have played the character as originally written (albeit probably without the demanding dance elements), but even toned down here for this "kinder, gentler" approach, he manages to convey a bit of Joey's smarm lying just beneath the charming surface. The happy ending of the film contrasts with that of the stage musical, where Joey is left alone at the end.
Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing.
4174	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is a heavy movie, but it rests comfortably on Michelle Pfeiffer's not so fragile shoulders.  I admit I loved watching this because her performance is so spectacular.  Probably one of the best I've seen her do.  It's unfortunate that her performance wasn't in a better film, but this film is good.  You can't compare it to the book which so many are doing.  I think by this time we all know a movie will never be as good as a book.  This could've been a lifetime made for movie, but instead it was a feature film.

5	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other "new wave/punk" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them "live" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as "pretty" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago.

Everything I thought I wanted as a guy just graduating from high school when I saw this film on the big screen.  I've had a long life journey since then, and when Fonda says to  Hopper "We blew it man" I really understand what that means now.  Drugs and alcohol have been a real dredge on our society, much glorified starting in the  60s and early 70s as everyone was trying to wrap their head around the Vietnam era and the draft.  This movie gives you a real picture of that era even though the war is never mentioned.  It also gives a good analgy of what people hold on to even today as 'Freedom.'  Captain America and Billy.  Lost souls in a lost time, in a lost place, makes for one hek of a good movie.  Especially for nostalgia lovers of the 60s and 70s.

Some have said that Timothy Dalton is "too handsome" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.

Everyone who has seen the movie has their favorite moments. For me it's probably a toss up between the "Spamalot" song, the Holy Hand Grenade, and the "Help, help! I'm being repressed!" scene. The events at Castle Anthrax is a close follow-up, but really the whole movie works and works well. There's not a bad moment in the film, not a joke that falls flat.

Rumpole was a old Bailey hack who remained always fiercely true to his man of the people ideals. I looked at my entire Rumpole series this set over the recent holiday season.  I was jolted by how much "She Who Must Be Obeyed" reminded me of one Hyacinth Bucket.

It was fun to see all the of the different Muppet incarnations, at that time, come together to celebrate Christmas.  The songs were fun, and contrary to many of the reviews, the plotline does not suffer greatly from the missing material.  Of course, it does suffer if you had seen that material for years and it is suddenly gone on the DVD version, but that wasn't the case for me.  BTW, to the purists, I felt that when Animal jumped through the screen and cut the Muppet Babies part very short, it was a blessing, because they're annoying...  All in all, good Christmas fare and a great deal when bought in the 2-pack with Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas.

The theme and plot is pretty much the same as the original except with a comic twist instead of a tragic one.  Steve Martin is C.D. Barnes, the captain of a voluntary fire station at a ski resort.  As with the original Cyrano, C.D. is a sensual and vocally articulate man who feels that his monstrous nose is always in the way of love.  He soon falls in love with the beautiful Roxanne (Daryl Hannah), an astronomer who just arrived to the town to chart the stars, but can't get himself to act.  Finding out that Roxanne has the hots for a clueless hunk in his fire station (Rick Rossovich), C.D. acts as the brains and mouthpiece while the hunk acts as the sexy model.  Things get hot but somethings just don't add up in Roxanne's mind.  The truth is soon unfolded and resolves itself in a happy ending for everyone.

Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.

I'v just found another critic named Roger Moore. Take a look at all the things he says were very dumb. "What kind of nitwit screenwriter names his fictional movie town 'Raccoon City'?" That's a qoute from his review. Are critics so pathetic during these days that they can't even do 1 minute of research on a game before they watch a movie based off of it? I wonder how many fans would have been pissed off if they changed the name of the city. Here's anothe quote, "...one mother of a creature dressed in a leather kilt. Yeah, a kilt." First of all, he should know that that is pretty much the same thing Nemesis wears in the game. Second of all, I don't think it's a kilt. He also takes the time to call the lickers, "...gargoyle like supermonsters." Critics today suck. Roger Moore can be reached at RMoore@orlandosentinal.com.

6976	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	This is one of the worst disasters in the history of filmmaking.  The casting was good.  The director of photography and his lighting crew is obviously extremely talented.  The editor is obviously talented.  The production design crew was obviously talented.  The story was salvageable.  Nonetheless, the film just plain stucked!  1) The directing of the actors was completely unconvincing. Every character and every emotional expression seemed like the director had no ability to pull an original, believable performance out of these capable actors.  2) It was totally derivative of films like Aliens and countless video games: "Keep it tight people", "Get over here!" etc, etc. 3) The gore was pointlessly disgusting to the point of connoisseurship, as if gore fans will be sipping their Pepsi like fine wine and commenting in a faux English accent, "Ah yes, that's just wonderful how the white of his eye just leaked out of that laser cut. And, oh my, the sound of walking on broken ankles is just an exhilarating aural bouquet."  I think people are actually getting off on this stuff, which is just sick.  4) The cinematography, which again must be approved by the director, is totally overdone.  Every single shot is seemingly an extreme close up or swooping crane movement or some other camera technique that is best used in moderation.  It's again just contrived to the point of aggravation.  5) The plot development and character development is totally out of whack, so that we don't know who anyone is or why we should give a damn until halfway into the film, and this is not in a good way like in Memento.  6) A giant beehive-like underground corporate R&D complex, a supercomputer AI programmed as the dead daughter of the programmer, self defense mechanisms that meet the ridiculous criteria parodied in Galaxy Quest...I could go on and on with the laughable ideas portrayed in this film.  Even worse is the ridiculous exposition the characters indulge in to relay these facts to us.  In the end I was left with a serious case of that "bad film" feeling.  A waste of my time and obviously the high quality film stock it was painstakingly photographed on.

The 35th anniversary edition is one of the very few movies whose "making of" segments were worth watching. Using interviews with Fonda, Hopper and others, it tells the story of the disarray of filming the movie and the struggle to get it on screen. Hopper's original cut came in at a mind-bending 3-1/2 hours long. Luckily, wiser hands wrested editorial control from him and gave us the masterpiece we have now.
I really liked Jodie Foster's supporting performance as the 12-year old prostitute, Iris.  She's only in a few short scenes but she captures the innocence-gone-bad that Travis so despises.

Elmo really loves his blanket, and he could never bear to part with it.  He loves it so much that he doesn't want to share it, even for a few minutes, with one of his little friends.  About this time, a series of humorous mishaps occur to land Blanket (it's essentially a character rather than an object) inside Oscar's garbage can.  Elmo dives it to get it, only to be transported (along with Blanket) to Grouchland.  This is a strange new world for Elmo, a place where you aren't supposed to ask for help or be kind to others.  Elmo's beloved blanket ends up in the hands of the mean and greedy Huxley (Mandy Patinkin), a man who lives by the creed "Whatever I touch is mine."  In order to get to Huxley's house and reclaim what is his, Elmo must overcome a number of challenges placed in his way and must even pass the ultimate challenge of the Queen of Garbage (Vanessa Williams).  There is of course a message to the whole story, with children (and adults) seeing why it is important to share what you have rather than be greedy.

I mean, come on:  Richard Dreyfuss sculpting on a heap of mashed potatoes in a (futile) attempt to recreate the image of Devil's Tower; earthlings communicating with a highly advanced civilization via. . .muscial notes.  My eye muscles were sore due to the constant rolling of them.  I was (and is) a huge fan of Spielberg's 'Jaws'; with this sci-fi pseudo epic, I had thought the young director badly missed the mark.

Charley is perfect for his role, as the prying, upstanding, though slightly inept high school boy, trying to convince everyone that Jerry is a Vampire. His friend, the scene stealing, Evil Ed, (Stephen Geoffreys, who pursued a porno star career afterwards) tells Charley all he needs to know about Vampires, for $8.00, LOL. He tells Charley his best protection right now is not to invite a Vampire in to his house, as a Vampire can not enter another's home, unless invited, so Charley feels relatively safe until his mothers calls him downstairs to meet his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, to Charley's horror! The tension of this scene is so real it's almost physical.

It is one of the most "pure" films that I've ever seen. Set in a small rural community in early 20th century Montana, the film is much more than your by-the-numbers, slice-of-life period piece that Hollywood trots out from time to time. It authentically evokes a real time and place and puts the viewer there, a rare feat. It is not a film of overt depth, yet it has a focused simplicity that effectively translates many basic truths about people that films that try to go deep often fail to do. It allows it's characters to develop at a leisurely pace and grow on the viewer. It doesn't beat the viewer over the head with character details and have scenes where they seem to be in a vacuum.

One last characteristic that all the major characters in these three films have in common is their persistent, uncompromising, diligently determined drive to all reach their goals - for good or ill. They are all absolutely hell-bent on following their dreams and dancing to the beat of their own drummer. They all choose freedom over security. Ironically, they all consciously choose the path of Odysseus - of wandering - but they all end up reaching the same end as Achilles - of dying young in a flame of glory. That's fate. The ancient Greeks called her "Moira." Even the Gods themselves are at her mercy. In EASY RIDER, Billy was always pushing his more contemplative partner onward toward their goal of reaching the famous whorehouse in New Orleans. It almost seems as if the only reason why "Captain America" wanted to also go was to pay his respects to their long lost companion, George (played dramatically by Jack Nicholson) the attorney who got them out of jail, whose idea it was to go there in the first place. Peter Fonda's character was loyal to a fault when it came to his friendship with Billy. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, Alberto (the horny rascal) was always pushing Ernesto to go out of his spiritual centeredness and jump into the dangerous fray of the more seedy side of life. Finally, in INTO THE WILD, it was "Alexander Supertramp's" intense reaction to the constant, dysfunctional fighting between his mother and father back home that pushed him on and outward to not ever end up in the same situation himself. We must also acknowledge that all of these characters were young and anxious to sew some of their wild oats, a natural condition of youth everywhere.

They talk about the genesis of the story and how everybody worked together.
For all of its pageantry and scope, this is a decidedly intimate little film that has far more to say about the nature of Faith and Things Larger than Oneself than it does, necessarily, about the historically enigmatic and ambiguous St. Joan.

TRANSFER: IT'S NOT WIDESCREEN. Enough said! You can't squeeze a 2:35:1 aspect ratio image into a 1:33:1 t.v. screen so you get what film buffs, such as myself, have been screaming about for years - a chopped up version of the movie (affectionately known as pan and scan)that in no way captures either the scope of the image or the director's original intent. This short coming alone leads me to fail this DVD on all accounts. That the cropped image is quite often blurry, at times hopelessly out of focus, and truly a weak transfer for its color balancing, contrast and black levels, is inexcusable. I'd really like to know why Columbia decided to re-release this movie on DVD. Certainly, no updates to the image quality have been made and worse still - the film is missing 50% of its picture. Misguided doesn't even begin to sum up Columbia's blunders on this disc. Also, the audio remains the same strident mix as before. No audio clean up or noise reduction leads to dialogue sounding way too forward and unnatural, while the songs screech, rather than sing, across your speakers.



The Blu-ray release from Kino does a good job of presenting the film. The film looks a bit soft in its presentation but I don't doubt this is what the film probably looked like originally during its theatrical run and the intent of Hall. It's always hard to judge because memory can be unreliable. The depth is a bit problematic at times while detail and colors are pretty good.
This is somehow the reason why I come back to the night sky again and again.  I've heard more than one backyard astronomer describe the night sky as a reliable, familiar friend.  Herein lies the true form on "Close Encounters," not that technology such as what the aliens possess exsists, or that we are enlightened by their coming.  What gives form to the film's premise is the possibility that when we look up at the stars, those stars are looking back.

8393	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	Has Never Seen the Original Stage Version.  This movie is a preposterous mess and it flopped for one simple reason: it bears little to no resemblance to the brilliant Broadway production of the late seventies.  The musical is full of fun and life, but the people behind this movie decided to go for a more cinematic version which was much darker and could and probably frequently does scare young children.  We have here Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily actually succeeding in capturing Annie (which never originally happened).  We even see the young orphan hanging on to an upraised bridge for dear life (an eleven year old actually in deadly peril?! For shame!!!!)  The added characters (Punjab and the Asp) added nothing but stupidity to an already horrendous film.  How can anyone criticize the Disney film of a few years ago?  It is much closer to the stage version than this monstrosity (and it included one of the best songs cut from the theatrical release - N.Y.C.).  I find it fascinatingly questionable that a cast of this caliber could have been involved in this disaster.  Some of Broadway's legendary performers (Ms. Burnett, Ms. Peters, Ms. Reinkin) should definately have thought twice.  Perhaps they were anticipating a rebirth of the movie musical and went about it totally in the wrong way.  I am so glad that I was involved in a stage production of Annie as Rooster.  One has to wonder how involved Mr. Charnin and Mr. Stousse were in this venture.  I recall seeing only that it was based on their original stage musical (however loosely).
My only lament for this, and its 80s brother in vamping, is the "safeness" of the tone. There's so much comedy in both, you often forget to be really scared. Fun stuff, but easy to watch with the lights on or off.

For those who haven't seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That's Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.  That mix of self-awareness and yet being completely unaware is the source of much of the humor.  It really does work and is quite funny.

And yet we're not supposed to think of Dreyfuss as a victim of an alien-induced obsession.  Rather, Spielberg wants us to be in awe of and admire these aliens who are, in Spielburg's view, a more intelligent, advanced enlightened species than the human species.  But the facts of his story completely contradict this Spielberg vision of alien goodness and virtue.  The aliens kidnap and/or brainwash innocent people for no apparent reason and yet, because they're "sensitive" and intelligent, we're supposed to go "awwww" and think how wonderful they are.

The storylines of the various "The Avengers" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the "The Avengers" because the overall series always manifested a "Batman" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.
early episodes, and follow in the trek of Patrick MacGoohan's "Danger Man", which turned into "Secret Agent" (and then into "the Prisoner").  These seven episodes are still in B&W, which I think even added to this mysterious ambiance of the episodes.

And, for whatever you can say about the movie in a negative light, Paul Anderson handles the subject matter much more deftly than Uwe Boll could ever do with his own Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead films.  So far, Resident Evil stands tall as the best and, sadly enough, most faithful video game movie yet.  That's not saying too much, given the competition, but it's still a fun, mindless romp through familiar territory.  And it could have been a lot worse.

"Russell Harty Plus" Interview with Jean Marsh (11:15)
And what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story.
My main complaint with the DVD: as a double-sided disc, you have the option of watching it on the square "full screen" shaped for TV, or the ALLEGED widescreen--- but the widescreen here is actually the square TV-version only with the 'heads and feet' cut-off in letterbox style... In other words, you're not only missing the SIDES of the picture [as you do in a standard square TV print, of course] but they've lopped off the top and bottom to create a pseudo-widescreen version, which means you're missing a major part of the picture from ALL FOUR SIDES! (As a result, the standard, square TV version has more visual data.... but neither side of the disc gives you the actual original widescreen theatre version.)

A decade ago, following the fantastic one-two punch of Leon and The Fifth Element, Besson suddenly seemed like the greatest popular moviemaker in the world. So, back then, I went to see The Messenger with sky-high expectations that were only bound to be disappointed.

1537	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.

It takes some characters from the games like Jill, Carlos, Sherry, and Nicolei, and makes every single one pointless. Even Alice, who was likable to a certain degree in the first one (at least you want her character to live) but in this one she is just a [jerk]. You really didn't care what characters lived or died in this tradgedy that calls itself a film.

She obviously had no training whatsoever. And Nemesis just look like a pile of poo rapped in armor. He looked so fake!

While loosely defined as a method, the "Evolving Bassist" is really more of a well thought out approach to playing the instrument.  The skills taught follow several threads of theory and practice, but it's not a beginner tutorial even though very early players will benefit from the material...and continue to benefit throughout their playing career.  If one is desirous of a more basic text in the jazz genre then you must get "The Michael Moore Bass Method", probably the best tutorial currently available; the classical  "Simandl" material notwithstanding.  The two books and the "Evolving..." DVD really are complimentary and easily stand at the forefront of a limited field.  Highly recommended.
Don't miss this and if you've seen it years ago, watch it again and again. Amazing!!!
If there were faults in the Blu-ray transfer, its the fact that there are not many special features included.  Just the audio commentary but no HD trailer and no making of featurette.  The other thing is that although the film looks better than many 1990's film on Blu-ray and avoids the waxy, DNR look but with its HD transfer, grain is elevated.  Though not too bad, it is noticeable and this may be a slight issue for some viewers but I tend to be on side of grain is part of film and high definition elevates the look of grain.  And personally, I would rather take the grain than a transfer with a lot of DNR or edge enhancement.

The director should be applauded for the way he avoided dance cliches and dull, straight-on filming of dance performances. Especially exciting was the from-the-wings view of the energetic "Esplanade" that opens the film. And the most entrancing sequence is the male solo from "Aureole." For this, Diamond has intercut a current rehearsal of Patrick Corbin learning the dance with three different archival versions of Taylor performing the same work. The music continues seamlessly as the visuals switch from one point in time to another, suggesting without preaching, that dances have a life of their own...and a good one has a chance of outlasting any of its interpreters. Diamond's other dance films include "Speaking in Tongues" (also Paul Taylor's company) and "A Balanchine Celebration," fine and important films in their own right, though not equal to this masterpiece.

BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion "Animagic" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.

9291	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I would just like to clear up a few issues that some of the sadly misled reviewers seem to harbor about this brilliantly funny film. First of all, I am deeply puzzled as to why an obvious farce (key word here: "farce") of medieval high-romance-type-stories must retain any modicum of historical accuracy.
The reason I'm particularly fond of this one is its references to classic movies, including Hamlet, in a fab b&w scene where Arnold as a grungy machine gun packing Dane says, "To be or not to be" and lights a bomb off his stogie. He tosses the TNT. Big explosion behind him and then a drolly given, "Not to be" ends the sequence.

Unless he meets the demands of Korshunov (radicals leader), everyone on board Airforce One will be executed.

The setting is a period to which I have become more and more attracted, the two decades between World War I and World War II.  Times are changing, but not necessarily for the better, or at least not for everyone.  The old guard is losing its hold over society, but those newly rising to power are not necessarily better than those who wielded it before.  If anything the old guard, based as it was on a landed aristocracy with a vested interest in England as a property, had reasons to keep things from falling totally apart for the middle and lower classes.  Their pride of place came as much from their perceived obligations as from their assets.  The rising nouveaux riche are vested in money alone, a portable commodity that can be invested wherever there is profit to be had.  Their focus is on who has the most of it; without ties to anything, they take no responsibility for the society that makes their fortunes.  Theirs were the ideals upon which our present world and its predicaments are based.

It has often been debated why it was that Charles believed Joan, and this movie offers some insights to more practical reasons rather than a true miracle.  Heavily influenced by his mother in law, played with kind of a creepy, witchlike appeal by Faye Dunaway, Charles has always doubted himself.  There was always a question about his lineage and his right to rule.  There was also a myth about a maid from Lorrain that was sent by God to lead France into victory.  She says it is what simple people believe; and, what the simple people believe is what will give him strength and power.  Also, according to myth and legend, when Joan was presented in the court to Charles, he had an impostor sit upon his throne.  If the maid Joan was truly of God, then she would pick him out of a crowd as the true Dauphaine.  Sure enough, Joan chooses correctly.  Joan and Charles would retreat into another room for a private conversation that only the two of them would witness.  Charles would emerge, according to witnesses, excited and amazed.  Did Joan perform a miracle?  Rather, Joan reassures him that she believed enough in him that he should be the true king of France.  Joan is given her army, and they would march onto victory.

3833	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	An interesting film from the canon of Steven Spielberg's illustrious career.  You can say that this film is an "E.T" for adults.  It is not clear from the start whether to view the visitors as a malevolent or friendly force.  The film introduces us to Roy Neary(Richard Dreyfus) who encounters an alien craft while repairing some downed power lines.  From that moment on he is obsessed with this encounter despite the toll it is taking on his family and his marriage.  We also meet Gillian (Melinda Dillon), a young divorcee whose toddler son has been abducted by the aliens.  The two join forces in attempting to locate these beings despite interference by a seemingly hearltless government beauracracy("E.T." again).  They eventually locate the mothership in Wyoming where there is a major multi-national effort to communicate with the mothership.  The scene in which the technicians use musical notes to communicate with the alien craft is classic.  Not to give anything away, when we do finally see the aliens and the inside of the mothership it is something of a letdown.  I like this film immensely, though I wouldn't exactly call it a great film in the legacy of Spielberg.  It's a nice thrill-ride of a movie and you have to put in perspective that this film came at the beginning of Spielberg's career before he evolved into possibly our greatest director.
Look, if you don't know the meaning of my title (run away, run away!! -hint: it involves a rabbit) -then you gotta get this movie, or at least rent it!  Very recommended!!!!

Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless.  I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept.  Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse.  I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.

A story of friendship, love and changes which "If they don't kill us, do indeed make us stronger" from one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled. A true story of love from a brother to his precious sister, as it says at the end; "To Susan from Bob". I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this classic to take a few hours and see for yourself. And for those who have seen it, but maybe it has been a while may I suggest that you too set aside some time to enjoy it once again.
The Spice Girls' fad seems to be over now, but it looked like they had a great time while they were around. And "Spice World", while certainly not nearly as great a film as "A Hard Day's Night," tells it all.
The acting in the film is satisfactory for a horror film. Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as Julie James and once again she proves she's not just about looks, this girl can act. I want to see her give a performance that can give that idea more justice, not just horror movies please! Still she is good as Julie. Freddie Prinze, Jr. also returns and he has improved his acting skills. He puts on a solid performance. Brandy is very eager in the material and her performance worked for me. Mekhi Phifer had me rolling in the aisles with his fun performance as Brandy's horny boyfriend. I also enjoyed the underused Jennifer Esposito as the bartender on the island, and Jeffrey Combs' breakaway as the ruthless hotel owner. Muse Watson is scary and evil again, his facials are fantastic, but every time the guy talks I cringe. I just can't take his lines that seriously. Bill Cobbs is merely okay as the weird guy on the island who is suspected as the killer.
Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman is just brilliant in this movie! They are the stars!
This is a film with many shots- carefully planned and technically beautiful shots.  But at times, they seem to exist in of themselves and not to further the story, the character, or the mood.  The shot going into a foaming glass of alka seltzer being just one example.  These shots eventually add up and contribute to a sense of tedium.  Also, the endless scenes of De Niro in his apartment eating cereal, practicing with his guns, or watching TV start to feel like exercises, revealing little that we don't already know.

The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood.

Not everyone is going to enjoy watching BOTTLE ROCKET.  The movie has a very odd pacing, even for a Wes Anderson film.  It's evident that both the director and cast were adjusting to making a major picture.  Also, since this is a Wes Anderson picture, not everyone is going to like, enjoy, or even understand the humor.  There are no cheap gags or easy jokes.  Instead, the comedy can best be described as intellectual-situational.  In short, it's kind-of Wes Andersonish.  A must-see for fans of Wes Anderson or any of the Wilson brothers as well as anyone who likes quirky dramatic-comedies.

It holds up to this day as a truly unforgettable film because every single person who had a hand in making it worked in perfect harmony to craft what could have been a simple reel of film into a gem. The creepy, soft jazz-laden music score by Bernard Hermann, the hypnotic cinematography, the top-notch directing by Marty Scorcese, the disturbing yet insightful screenplay by Paul Schrader, and one of the best performances by a young DeNiro, all prove that you're not only watching a movie, you're watching cinema.

While Dignan is the showier role, Anthony is the crux of the movie; it is told through his eyes.  Luke Wilson, an actor of low-key charm who gets more appealing the more I watch him, plays the yin to his brother Owen's yang.  Anthony is Dignan's more adult alter ego.  Or, more accurately, he's Dignan's Big Brother figure: full of support and amusement for Dignan's harebrained schemes, always willing to lend a hand, and, if needed, a sane word.  An odd role for a man just released from a mental hospital.  And Wilson, in his first film role, even gets to play a very touching and tender romance with Inez (Lumi Cavazos), a Spanish-only speaking maid at a motel.  It's this section, which takes up most of the film's middle third, which defines Anthony's character most.

Bridges plays a "shock jock" who unwittingly helps to cultivate more madness in Manhattan, a karmic psychological madness that he finds constantly dogging his heels.  Williams plays a vigilante knight, coincidentally created by Bridges' radio show, running loose in Manhattan (and his own mind) on a quest for the holy grail, "a billionaire's bowling trophy". As Bridges slides deeper into his karmic pit of unresolved guilt the exciting and gorgeous Mercedes Reuhl plays an oscar-winning role as his lover on the way down.  Amanda Plummer succeeds as William's timid mousy love interest.

That about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in.

A role like that of Billy Hayes doesn't come along all that often for a young actor, and certainly didn't any more so thirty years ago.  Relatively few young people of that era actually wound up in a Turkish prison, of course, but Billy's attempt to smuggle a moderate amount of hashhish out of Turkey was reflective of the druggie derring-do of the era.  It was,inessence, the classic crazy youthful stunt, and if Billy had pulled it off, he no doubt would have relished having an exciting foreign adventure tale to tell his friends as they turned on back in the States.  One thing's for sure, he never would have expected a life sentence in a brutal Turkish prison.
Dreyfuss is extremely under-rated in his performance as a man driven to the brink as he experiences an otherworldy encounter with extra-terrestrials while inside of his vehicle.  Not knowing the affect this would later have on his life, he returns home as if nothing happened.  Dreyfuss's behavior grows stranger and stranger (he first makes a mountain out of mashed potatoes at the dinner table, then creates an even larger model of this mysterious mountain out of his yard while still inside his house), he realizes that he most confront this incredible feeling that has overcome his mind and search for answers.  What he encounters is magical and unbelievable.

Again, I highly recommend watching this movie.

Yeah it's basically the next generation "trapped with dead people" film but it has a wicked style that makes it stand out from the other zombie flicks. What really shocked me was the acting. It's about time we got people on the screen who can carry a line as well as shotgun. As far as the DVD the highlight was surprisingly the commentary. Paul, Milla, and Michele are hilarious. Commentaries are usually straight forward and a little on the dull side but this trio of crackups just had me rolling on the floor. Yes it's true Resident Evil is not ... and worth the cash.
"Taxi Driver" has proved to be one of my favorite films and relates to other figures in Hollywood and literature.

There are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of "7 years",  is not always the most probable one.

EXTRAS...While I have read that there were several extras on other releases of this film,  this particular release had no 'making of' documentaries or commentaries.  The only extra, which I did not use or try, is a special pop up called 'In Movie A View from Above (Editor's Fact Ttrack'.  This feature pops up an icon, depending upon which version of the film you are watching that provides a fact or two about why a specific scene was cut or added back in as well as other trivia I suppose.  At least there were no previews for other movies taking up room on the Blu Ray.  I hate to pay for advertising and an even greater compression of the feature film than it needs to be.

Is there a fourth version of this film?  When I saw it at the theater in January 1978, I remember seeing the power plant AND the ship-in-the-desert scene AND the Wyoming scene with the future "Apollo Creed," which appear together in none of these versions.  When I bought the Criterion version, I remember being disappointed at not seeing them.

None of the movies Andrew Niccol has made since "Gattaca" have even come close to this level of skill -- the movie is a slow, elegant winding of murder mystery and philosophical sci-fi. The plot quietly grows in tension as Vincent's life becomes more tangled up in lies and suspicion, with quietly powerful dialogue laced with dry humor ("I guess we can rule out suicide," comments a cop as they bag a bloodied keyboard).
The main idea of the film is freedom.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper take a motorcyle trip across the USA while heading for Mardi Gras.  Although this is the destination, Peter Fonda (is looking for something.  This something could be America, but you feel it is more profound than that.  You receive hints from the things he says to others.

Mortimer portrays most of the legal profession as not only self-involved to the point where it affects their interpretation of the law, but as insufferably ignorant and stupid.

3179	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This is an enormously famous movie, one that has achieved iconic status.  That means it's great, right?  Well, not necessarily.  It's an incredibly amateurish and uneven flick, with gaping holes in the plot, in the dialog, in the editing.  The performances are (quite literally) stoned and dazed.  But in this birds nest of oddness there are enough true gems to put it firmly in the forefront of classic cinema.  These are the scenes we've all seen before: the famous "This used to be a hell of a good country" scene at the campfire comes to mind.  That soliloquy alone is worth the price of the DVD.  I think it all boils down to the fact that there is basically nothing worth getting too sentimental about from this time period.  The crazy crack pot adolescence of the American nation doesn't bear too much scrutiny or it becomes painfully obvious that if you weren't stoned, you didn't get it, and you won't get it now.  In other words, you have to believe it to see it.  I do believe some of it, sometimes, and this movie helps me glimpse that small part.  But it also shows me how painfully vaccuous and dreary and empty and pointless so much of the youth counterculture truly was.

The suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.

With hilarious skits and sketches about the 'black knight', the idiot prince having an arranged marriage, court hijinks, endless combat and immaculate chivalrous behavior, we get the typical Monty Pythonesque fast-paced action.  What is remarkable about them is that they made so much from so little.  The great bit about the Black Knight is only a few minutes and is rather grim, yet it's silly and fun in keeping with the overall theme.
While watching the film, the viewer inherently knows there is a tragic component that will manifest itself, yet the beauty of Norman's memories offsets the tragedy and helps deliver the lump-in-your-throat ending.  Sheffer gives an admirable performance as the brooding older brother, and he's augmented by romantic interest Jessie (Emily Lloyd).  Yet Pitt's persona literally leaps from the screen; the actor is a bona fide scene stealer.  Poignant, emotional, touching, cerebral, and often funny, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT is a gorgeous film enthusiastically recommended.

In a total 90s filmmaking style, although taking place in the 80s, the movie moves forward and back in time to describe the quirky characters and were their lives will go. Much like Noah Baumbachs 1995 debut, Kicking and Screaming, the movie is about moving on. It retains the society philosophies that were seen in Kicking and Screaming but puts it to an angst and punk soundtrack, which the soundtrack to this movie is quite good. Matthew Lillard stars as Stevo, who alongside his pal, Bob, decide to spend their post college year pissing their lives away, only to realize that they and their friends must move forward with life and out of their unrealistic punk ideals.

Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) immediately tries to negotiate with the terrorists to get the hostages off the plane alive while the military follows the beacon to the president's escape pod.  Everything changes when the escape pod is found - empty.  President James Marshall never left the plane and he is determined to make the terrorists pay.  However, the terrorists quickly notice that their numbers are dwindling and assume that there is a secret service agent loose on the plane.  They begin killing hostages in the hopes that they will find one that matters enough to the unknown man for him to give himself up.  With the clock ticking and increasing numbers of hostages being murdered, President Marshall soon finds that he is forced into negotiating with the terrorists and arranging for the release of General Radek from prison.  But that doesn't mean that he is beaten as he uses every trick in the book to get the terrorists off his plane...
This is Biblical, well-acted, and the filmmakers are to be praised for the sound Biblical research. Although some of the sexually explicit scenes,it should be screened from the very young. It is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in Joseph. The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies. But nevertheless, it still tells a good story of a man who never lost faith in the Lord amidst all the trials and sufferings that he experienced before achieving success in life.

5168	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	A film like "Taxi Driver" could not be made today.  Even in it's day it was highly misunderstood even among it's admirers as an exploitation film.  The first time I saw this film was on a double-bill in 1982 with a repugnant slasher film, "Maniac".  It's reputation probably wasn't helped because it was the impetus for an assassination attempt on the President.  The seventies saw a lot of daring films greenlighted but even by these permissive standards "Taxi Driver" must have been a tough sell.  The story centers on the paranoia of a lonely, disengaged taxi driver,Travis Bickle, played by Robert DeNiro who is disgusted with the vice of his chosen city, New York.  He may be more dangerous than the vermin he dispises.  When his feeble attempts to connect with other people are rebuffed he falls back on the only way he knows, violence.  He also elevates himself in his mind as some kind of avenging angel.  He takes it upon himself to be the protector of a 13 year-old prostitute, whether she wants to be saved or not.  It goes without saying that DeNiro gives a commanding and daring performance here.  It was his first starring role in a major film and he makes an impression.  He is ably supported by a supporting cast that includes Harvey Keitel as a pimp, Cybil Shepherd as a pretty campaign worker who rebuffs Travis after he takes her to a porn film, and a young Jodie Foster as the prostitute.  Director Martin Scorsese does a superior job from an excellent script from Paul Schrader.  This was Schrader's first script that was produced and he has never surpassed "Taxi Driver" with any subsequent screenplays.  The cinematography by Michael Chapman is excellent, a kind of hazy picture of vice-ridden New York before it was cleaned up.  Enough cannot be said about the jazzy score by Bernard Herrmann that heightens whatever mood is being conveyed.  This DVD contains an excellent documentary, but no commentary by Scorsese.  On a final note, is the last scene reality or a dream?  Does Betsey(Shepherd) really get in Travis' taxi or is it something he just imagines like so many other things?

George Washington was one of the giants of history, and this film is a dramatization of one of his many great achievements -- the Battle of Trenton.  Leading a small, discouraged, and cold and hungry American militia Army, Washington took on the finest soldiers in the world and won a great victory.  Had he not done so, the American revolutionary cause might well have failed.  History correctly records that it was George Washington whose inspired leadership won the Battle of Trenton.

Amy and Ed are concerned about Charlie's well being and figure humor his claims that his neighbor is a vampire.  So Amy and Ed go to speak to Peter "The Great Vampire Killer" Vincent (Roddy McDowall, "Planet of the Apes"), a burnt out horror movie star turned late night T.V. show host for campy horror films (mainly his own).  Charlie is a huge fan of Peter Vincent's work and conceders him a hero.  This is why Charlie's friends seek Peter out.  On the flip side, Amy and Ed are thinking Charlie's imagination is running amuck about Jerry because of all of his Peter Vincent viewing.  Anyway I digress; Amy and Ed talk to Peter about their friend Charlie and the obsession that Jerry is a vampire.  Now how two teenage kids are able to convince a movie star (burnt out or not) to speak with their "potential" insane friend, still befuddles me.  Anyway, after some pretty definitive proof, it is discovered that Jerry REALLY IS A VAMPIRE!  Charlie's confirmation is now fact and the other characters are quite shocked at this finding.
I usually refrain from commenting on other reviews here, but I would like to state that this film is, in no way, "clueless..." or vapid.  It acknowledges some sad truths about human beings and their frailties...frailties born of love.  There is no perfect faith and no perfect human being and it is often hardest for us to help the ones closest to us.  Sometimes no amount of pulling on the proverbial "boot straps" is going to change the outcome. Life would be nice if it were that simple...sometimes it isn't--It's even happened to conservatives on occasion.

  "Taxi Driver" remains for me the best piece of work by Martin Scorsese. Stripped of the pretense of "Raging Bull" and the stylized atmosphere of "GoodFellas", "Taxi Driver" is a unashamedly honest look at New York city and its effects on a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran. Often uneasy to watch but amazingly and utterly compelling, "Taxi Driver" launched Martin Scorsese into the pantheon of great directors.

Brilliant throughout, mostly.  Not recommended for lagophobes but a hearty romp for all others.  OK, a few quotes.  "Not the curtains!" and ummm...."I'm not old...I'm thirty-seven..".

Yes, it is begging to be some sort of metaphysical contemplative puff piece on the nature of family, love, existence, blah blah blabbity blah!

3623	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I was only 11 years old when this first came out in 1977.  Because I was so caught up in the Star Wars phenomenon, and also because I thought (being a child, mind you) that the movie story line was a bit lame (and a bit weird with the way Richard Dreyfuss's character was), I didn't particularly care for it.  Where's Luke Skywalker?  Darth Vader?  "May the force will be with you?"  The Death Star?  The Millenium Falcon?  You get the idea.  Nevertheless, I still remember those 5 notes/tones that define it.  After a time, I pretty much forgot all about the movie.  Until I saw it on T.V. recently.  Wow, 35 years have passed since its release!  I now appreciate the story line much more, especially the human element of it, understanding human nature much more as a 46 year old adult now.  I'm not so ga-ga about the movie as the average person, but I still do like it and think it is a good movie.  Seeing such a young Richard Dreyfuss makes this movie have such a nostalgic impact, and the appreciation of the passage of time.

Also, the sci-fi element focuses on realistic near future themes.  People do NOT fly strange cars and go to strangely shaped buildings...instead there is a realistic element that enables the viewer to enjoy the film for what it is, and not be distracted with pointless sci-fi stereotypes.  The issue of genetic manipulation is one that has been brought to attention lately and this film manages to show both sides of the issue without appearing to be a piece of propaganda.  The Valids as they are called have all of the benefits of the genetic manipulation while the Invalids do not.  The interesting premise here is that even an Invalid can rise above and beyond what his or her capabilities 'should' be.  Also a Valid may still resort to the basic human instincts and actions despite all coding in the opposite direction.  An amazing portrayal of what might be possible and very real in the near future.
8942	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	We enjoy this film in our house and the music is very cute, Elmo is sweet, his little adventure into Grouchland is fun and all of the good things you come to expect from Sesame Street. There is one thing that stands out as being kind of wonky, though: Elmo happens upon Zoe, who is crying because her father had to work and couldn't take her out. Elmo consoles her by allowing her to hold his precious blanket and when he decides he'd like it back, she replies, "In a minute, Elmo." So Elmo says, "Elmo wants his blanket back now." The ensuing tug of war ends up with a rip in the blanket which then gets lost in a series of unfortunate events. The problem here is that when Elmo asked for his blanket back, Zoe should have given it to him and thanked him rather than insisting on holding it to the point where he had to forcibly try to reclaim it. Now the blanket also wouldn't have ripped if Zoe hadn't been fighting to hold onto an item that wasn't hers and which had been requested returned by the owner. I think the story goes on to teach kids to not be selfish and greedy like Huxley, and at one point the Queen of Trash compares Elmo to Huxley because Elmo wanted his own blanket back. There's a difference between Huxley, who took anything and everything and made it his, and Elmo who rightfully owned his blanket. Kids shouldn't be forced to share. Kids should not be taught that anyone OWES them their stuff, that when they borrow something they can refuse to return it and so on. Ultimately the film is cute and had some funny bits and nice songs, but the message is a real stinker.

The Bonus Disc was out of this world. You get 50 minutes of the surviving cast talking about the show. It was recorded in December 2013, so Shout!

The Resident Evil movies are supposed to be zombie movies, but they're made into action/sci-fi bullcrap. Sure, zombie films have some action in them, but it's more realistic action. Sadly, these films use stylized action that look like they were taken from the Matrix Bargain Bin with its slow motion bullets, wire-fu, and choppy editing to try making the film look "cool". And they fail miserably. Zombie films make the action secondary, but this is an action film and the zombies are secondary.

Yet in many ways, they are a single family, and we see them from the period 1905 to the 1920s, an era of profound social change, and we see the effects such changes have on this household, from a time when going "into service" was routine to the time when having half a dozen servants for a small upper middle class family such as the Bellamys was beginning to be the exception, not the rule.

There are Zombies, Cereberus(the zombie dogs) and a licker (was in the 2nd RE game) which is supposed to be the major killing machine filling in for the tyrant, which is pretty lame really if your a fan of the RE game as well as the novel. I thought the special effects done on the licker where a little too computer fetched too, and it didn't even kill the victims right. According to the game the lickers had a certain way they killed their victims, which was by twisting the victims heads off with its tongue. Coulve been better gore effects as well, if anyone thinks this is the best zombie movie ever made, then you have only seen the original night of the living dead, or no other zombie movie.

"Steel Magnolias" is built around the lives and friendships of six women in the Bayou country of Louisiana. It's a beautiful setting and the filming is excellent. The story unfolds at a glacial pace and you gradually feel that you are a part of the women's lives. Then a slowly developing crisis overtakes two of the women and, of course, involves everyone else deeply. Be sure you have a handkerchief or two within east reach as it becomes a very sad movie. And then resolution and life goes on. Parts of the movie are light and funny, but then the story draws you into deep sorrow. My wife thought it was very depressing. Me, I rolled with it with only the loss of a few tears now and then. In any case, the acting was excellent and was rewarded with a number of Academy Award nominations. It's a very well-worth-watching movie.

Scorsese's appearance as a homicidal jilted husband is blood-chilling; in only a few sentences he sums up the base mentality of, I fear sometimes, this entire American culture.

Because CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was made after America's twin debacles with Vietnam and Watergate, it takes a low-key but rather apparent questionable view of the military and the government--as Stephen King put in his book "Danse Macabre", a "don't-let-the-military handle this" approach.  In its scope and approach, this movie is closer, in a middle-class way, to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which Spielberg has always numbered among his favorites, than to any sci-fi film of the past.  Dreyfuss and Dillon are excellent in their roles, as is Truffaut; and as for John Williams' score...what more needs to be said; it's brilliant.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (also known as CE3K) won an Oscar for Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, though four other men (William Fraker, Douglas Slocombe, John Alonzo, Laszlo Kovas) are also credited.

That cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.
Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon! At least the DVD should have indicated what's in store so parents could be informed.

Scorsese's masterpiece is not intended for the young or emotionally disturbed. Bickle is not a hero in a film populated by an army of non-heroes. Still, viewers just might get confused.

I know it isn't the same for everyone but I get the jist of it.  As always, Susan Sarandon is infectious (no pun intended), she's one of the most brilliant actresses alive, maybe ever.  Julia Roberts is tough and upfront while Ed Harris shows an emotional, quieter character who doesn't have as much film time as he should.
There are special effects in this movie, but they do not overpower the realism of human acting. The zombies, and most importantly, the Nemesis monster, are real actors in elaborate costumes and makeup.

It's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing!

But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle.

5191	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I had heard of "Taxi Driver" when President Ronald Reagan had gotten shot and finally, one day, I saw what the fuss was about after viewing the movie. This is one amazing and disturbing movie, folks. "Taxi Driver" is the movie that John Hinckley, Jr was taken by, when he became obsessed with impressing Jodie Foster, prompting his assassination attempt. It can be quite disturbing for people sensitive to racial and sexual issues. The combination of graphic language and sexual themes makes this a movie that should not be on everyone's "essential movie collection." But for those who are fans of people like Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, director Martin Scorsese (tidbit about Scorsese below), and composer Bernard Hermann, it is worth every penny.

One of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more "sensitive and kind" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.
And then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.

Upstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.
This ending has been debated for years. It is so controversial that when the film first ran on television, stations posted warnings stating they did not consider Bickle a hero. They're right. Bickle's a whacked-out cultural icon, granted, but he's no hero. He wants to be a hero, and perhaps the final scene is Bickle at the moment of death dreaming of a happy ending. He's essentially saved the day and rescued a damsel in distress. Bickle was seriously wounded after the shootout, having been shot in the neck. So it could have been a dream sequence, though Scorsese purposefully made it too vague to be entirely sure.

Notice how little dialogue he actually has with Iris, played incredibly by Jodie Foster, before deciding to "save" her from Sport. Iris doesn't even want him to do it. Who she is doesn't matter to Travis. What she represents matters more to Travis. He's embarking on a rampage, intending to kill lots of people (including the presidential candidate in a thwarted attempt), yet he only succeeds in killing the pimps.
Anyway, I recommend seeing Taxi Driver.  It's a good movie- a bonafide classic.  It's not as emotional or visceral as it should be, and falls into tedious lapses, but that doesn't detract from the influence it has had or the power it still can have over audiences.

One of the funniest aspects of this movie is the dialogue.  Some of the scenes are incredibly funny.  The burning of the witch (she turned me into a newt!) and Dennis the peasant (you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery taut threw a sword at you!) are among the most memorable.  Equally funny is Arthur's battle with the black knight and Sir Robyn's encounter with the giant (when danger reared it's ugly head, he boldly turned his tail and fled).
The documentary really gives the view a renewed appreciation of what it took to make this film.
Ever since playing Han Solo in STAR WARS and Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Ford has developed into a leading man of the action genre--the thinking man's action hero.  That aspect blossomed in PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and, especially THE FUGITIVE; and here in AIR FORCE ONE he gets to play the most important man in the world.  He does it with considerable style.  Glenn Close was also a cagey choice to play the first female vice-president, and she does this with incredible fortitude.  William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell are equally fine in supporting roles as part of the President's staff.  And Oldman, whose performance as Oswald in Oliver Stone's JFK was a miracle performance, is equally superlative as the villain, matching the Bruce Willis/Alan Rickman pairing in DIE HARD.
Overall, though it doesn't include every one of his films, this collection stands out as being a great presentation of 9 films, many of them classics. As a life-long Mel Brooks fan, I definitely recommend it.

The story, the music and the magic surrounding this movie are very powerful. The "hidden" subplot of the UFO's bringing out the artist in the people who saw them is very clever and an important part of the film.

Disc One was loose in the box, with no way to secure it, but Disc Two was secured with a central hub that I absolutely could not remove the disc from to save my life.  The wheels on my car are not held as securely, and I was very concerned about breaking the disc in my attempts.  I even made a futile attempt to bang it with a coconut, to no avail.  I finally ended up sacrificing the "collector value" of the packaging and quite literally destroying the central hub with an X-Acto knife and a drill burr to remove the disc without destroying it.

It's all predictable and quite dumb, but if you don't look for a dazzlingly original story and a pitch-perfect script then I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is great fun. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a nice heroine, she is continuously good to look at, and the set decoration is nice, although I found it odd that it was set on a Bahamian island and was shot in Mexico. Still, there is heaps of eye candy in many scenes and there are no breaks from the gore, which is great for teenagers, although the film was a tad too graphic for my liking. The only absolutely major quibble was the editing. Half the time it looked like the actors mimed the words and then put them onto a speaker phone after the shooting, and it looked terribly messy and was a largely irritating flaw. But, don't worry about that too much, just sit back and let this film do what it was made to do - entertain.

6108	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Although Turkey is one of the most modern muslim states around , it always had it's problems since the country tries to establish a democracy via military violence . The nation's jail situation though is not presented here as an impersonal documentary but through telling the true story of Billy Hayes who was sentenced to life imprisonment for carrying drugs . In fact , Midnight Express is more about this young man's tragedy than it is about Turkey . Parker has created a movie so schockingly realistic and brutal that leaves the viewer speachless . Brad Davis who died in the early 90's is excellent too , delivering an emotional perfomance which is the heart of the film . The atrocities taking place inside the prison are being displayed here with all the details and the result is sometimes too much for some of us ( the tongue-bitting is one of the best and most scary paranoia sequences ever made ) . A few seconds before the end titles , as Hayes disguised is watching a military viacle coming his way , i've experienced more agony and fear in my life than ever while watching a film .

Petersen's direction, despite some missteps, never allowed the film to sag; and Jerry Goldsmith's music score is appropriately patriotic without being sickeningly so, and always suspense-building.  This is a film well worth watching.  Don't miss it, especially if you're a fan of such situational thrillers.

I now own the entire series, and it is so delightful to be able to escape the horrors of network news programs, local "breaking news" reports (the latest car chase), and phony "reality" shows, and to sit down with a nice glass of Trader Joe's Plonk (the California equivalent of Chateau Thames Embankment) and indulge in an unadulterated orgy of Rumpole from beginning to end.
This film reminded me, in many ways, of the movie _Vanishing Point_, most likely because that film came out two years after _Easy Rider_.  Both depict a lost generation, endlessly searching for something that isn't there, only to be sacrificed for their journey.  The acting in this film is terrific and the meaninglessness of the film's ending is heartbreaking for those audience members who desperately seek to find the same thing that these two free spirits are searching for.

The only problem I had with the story is that it seems to drag a bit during its middle scenes.
This hilarious film has lost none of its punch over the years. There are so many memorable scenes and great running gags. The humor is still fresh and interesting, but the style blends well with modern comedy. Although Allen has moved away from this style in his more modern films, his early work appeals to younger audiences. This was the first time he wrote, directed, and starred in a film, a trend that would continue for years afterward.
The movie begins with Faith as a girl, playing with a Ouiji board. She asks who her soulmate is, and it gives her the name Damon Bradley. All her life, she waits to find him, but is unsuccessful. Marisa Tomei does an excellent job portraying the naive dreamer, Faith. When a phone call turns out to be a lead on discovering her soulmate, Faith and Kate fly to Venice, hoping to find him...ten days before Faith is supposed to marry the wrong man. In Venice, Faith runs into Peter Wright *literally* who chases her down to return her shoe. The moment she bumps into him, he falls in love with her! Seeing it as his only opportunity to get to know her, Peter (played by Robert Downey Jr.) pretends to be Damon.
It takes a lot of courage to leave the comforts of home and cut loose from all of your support system of family and friends and to just take off and hit the road to God knows where. It's a "wild world," as Cat Stevens sings, and you've got to take care. All three films show the major characters getting into trouble out on the road. "Alexander Supertramp" (the vagabond name Christopher McCandless chose for himself after cutting up his social security card and all of his other documents of official identity before he hit the road) got the hell beaten out of him by railroad man one dark night when he was hobo-ing it out on a train. Both Ernesto and Alberto got chased out of town by a jealous husband and all of his hometown buddies after one of his friends saw the husband's wife flirting and dancing with Ernesto on the dance floor. In EASY RIDER, Peter Fonda's motorcycle gets a flat tire (the least of their troubles) just like Alberto's motorcycle kept on breaking down and eventually dying on them in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES. These young characters in all of these films were not exactly experiencing the metaphysical revelations of Robert M. Pirsig in his masterful ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE - at least not at first - but they certainly all ran into a lot of trouble. The spiritual revelations began to come to them later, along the way. Indeed, all the major characters have major transformational experiences in one way or another as a result of their personal quests and traveling adventures. The road changes you. Also, there are many forks in the road, as Neil Young most recently informs us. It's hard to decide sometimes which way to go.

 The director makes no overt rejection of Travis Bickle's ultimate violence, but it may be found in the way the outburst is filmed: the massacre is artfully done, but brutal and unrelenting, and tellingly, there is no music. Herrmann's score works here by its very absence: he and Scorsese subtly inform us that there is no counterpoint to the violence, that it is what it is - and that for the audience, just as Travis must feel, there is no escape.

As I mentioned, I have not seen last year's remake with Colin Farrell and David Tennant, so I cannot compare the two.  I will have to make it a point to watch it someday.  But I have seen the direct sequel to 1985's Fright Night, and while entertaining in its own way, it simply cannot hold a stake to the original.  To me, the original Fright Night became an instant classic immediately upon its release, with its perfect blend of acting, story, and direction, the latter two both courtesy of Tom Holland (Child's Play, also with Chris Sarandon).  A perfect example of fun film making from the 80's that has scarcely aged at all, and today is as fresh, frightening, and funny as it was almost three decades ago.  Fright Night is... for REAL...!
As for the audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1. (Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack).  For the most part, the film is front channel heavy as it is dialog-driven.  Although there are action sequences, they are very few and if anything comes alive is the music by Giorgio Moroder.
7964	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I wasn't sure what to expect here - and it had a bit of a slow start, but I found myself intrigued and involved in the story to the very end. It may require a bit of patience - but definitely worth watching.
My main problem with this story is the fact it tries to pound one element into your head over and over again and never offers much of anything else.  A man born all-naturale wants to have the same priviledges as his genetic superiors.  For the first half, it worked admirably.  Then it started to get pretty dang stagnant.  Still it kept riding this one-trick pony till the cows came home.  Not sure what that means really, except I was annoyed and bored to freakin tears.
The extras on the DVD are probably worth it just to the fans of the flick, but I have yet to meet a person who saw the movie and didn't like it.

Unfortunately, these things take up maybe 15 to 20 minutes of screen time in a 131-minute film. Whatever good ideas the original script may have held were eventually watered down through countless rewrites, studio interference, test screening feedback, and last-minute reshoots. Danny Madigan is an incredibly whiny and annoying lead character that engenders no audience sympathy at all. I can't blame poor Austin O'Brien too much; I'm sure the kid did exactly what everyone asked of him. The hiring of John McTiernan as the director, especially where he made his mark with 'Predator' and 'Die Hard,' also turned out to be a much bigger mistake than anyone realised. The director may be deft with the action stuff, but has no sense of comedy whatsoever. Far too many of the gags in the film are thudding unfunny. For long stretches of the film, everyone seems to forget that they're making a spoof of dumb action films, and instead just proceeds to make a dumb action film.

2206	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	2.0	I'm just tired of movies that have no individuality.  They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions.  How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain?  Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort?  Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those `women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles.  That is the big issue with `Air Force One', there is nothing original here.  The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation.  It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really.  The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once.

At the same time, this film has many controversies and flaws to it.  Many fans of the novel condemn Streisand for totally changing the story around, and attempting to make the movie more about her character, Susan, when originally her role was not quite as central.  It is also (agreeably) criticized for implying that revealing a secret repressed with just magically make everything better.

9838	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	This movie is really really good-looking. It is essentially a murder mystery wrapped in science-fiction coating. Ethan Hawke plays an over-ambitious man who dreams of becoming an astronaut. Jude Law extracts pity as a crippled man confined to a wheelchair. The movie's message is that a child's physical or biological traits at birth, or even till age 10, cannot accurately predict how he/she would do in later life.


The film also contains the last ever film score from Bernard Hermann who had previously done Citizen Kane and Psycho to name but two. This score is really excellent. A Jazzy saxophone with a haunting melody, but that changes menacingly without warning. Quite brilliant.

The sound has also been improved, and instead of having to turn the volume way up in order to hear anything outside of the action sequences, it was considerably more manageable. Between the picture and the sound, all of the over-the-top, corny action sequences really came to life here and made me feel like I was part of the action (which seems to be a key aspect of the movie's original intent). Presented in crystal-clear 1080p high definition in 2.40:1 widescreen, this is the best quality Last Action Hero can ever have.

As others have said, this last season isn't as funny as previous seasons and Bob Newhart is away for many of the episodes. With that said, a mediocre episode of The Bob Newhart show is still better than most of what's on TV these days. I would give the content of this season 4 stars but, as much as I hate to say it, the quality of many of the transfers on many of these episodes only deserves a 3 and some less than that. I can handle grainy but a couple of episodes are so washed out that everything in the scene looks sepia toned and the colors are barely there.

The trend of cinema and other forms of art as a mainstream attraction and influence on everyday life have escalated to gargantuan proportions. As society becomes more "plastic" the perpetuators of "plastic" want to exponentially increase their monopolistic viewpoint and hold on the retail market and thus their hold on the individual. Many critics compared this film to "A Hard Day's Night" but they are sadly missing the point. "A Hard Day's Night" was the last film as that traversed the void from innocence into cynicism. George Harrison's scene with the advertising executive was a forerunner of thing to come as big business learns how to mold the teenage market. "Spice" in its entirety is about big business and the teenage market. Roger Moore seen with a pig in his lap is not doing a James Bond parody of Blofeld. Roger's character is commenting on big business and the plastic society it has created. That's no ordinary pig in his lap. That's a golden pig.

  * "Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express" by Director Alan Parker - As mentioned, the release is featured in digibook format and includes a 42-page booklet/personal memoir titled "Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express" by Director Alan Parker.  This book is quite thorough in the challenges the film had and also, how Brad Davis was a method actor and in essence became Billy Hayes.  Also, how warden Hamidou (Paul L. Smith) was also a bit rough on the actors during the torture scenes to the dismay of the actors who were to pretend as if they were being beaten (and too get that realism, Smith didn't hold back).  Also, how John Hurt (who played Max) didn't shower for six weeks in order to make his scene seem real and natural.  The personal memoir is quite detailed and those who enjoyed the film will enjoy reading this book filled with photos and storyboard sketches.

 I still love Spielberg's epic UFO creation. It's a sort of quasi-religious experience for a kid raised on "War of the Worlds" and "Invaders From Mars." In "Close Encounters," the aliens were friendly and most shocking of all - we were nice to them! This had not been done before as the alien standard was usually a growling James Arness dressed as a murderous carrot.
There just wasn't anything interesting or dramatic about any scene, aside from the gun fight. And the music was god awful.

Anyone with a heart will love this movie.  If you are not easily moved by sentiment and poignancy, then you probably won't appreciate it.
Also, some may view "Easy Rider" as a creative and artistic film as Hopper wanted to take advantage of creative editing styles but it would be interesting to see how his original 220 minute feature would be compared to the Henry Jaglom edited final 95 minute theatrical version.

The film is rife with Spielberg's great cinematic signatures and humorous touches (the UFOs, who are first mistaken for a truck pulling up behind Roy's vehicle, lift up and fly *over* him, but he's too busy reading a map to notice).  The final half-hour of the film is virtually dialogue free -- at least, in this particular edition -- and ends in a show of lights that mirrors the look of "2001"'s last segment, if lacking in that earlier film's impact.

What surprised me about Spielberg's film is how well the story of a peaceful encounter between humanity and a spacefaring civilization is told. Not only are the 1977 special effects still effective, but the human interest part of Close Encounters was compelling. As seen mostly from the point of view of Indiana electrical engineer Roy Neary (Dreyfuss), the movie depicts the mystery and wonder of how we discover that we are not alone in this universe. It shows that even though Neary loses almost everything to the compulsion mysteriously implanted into his mind, he eventually finds that his sacrifices were worth it.
No, you won't find King Arthur here.  You won't find Camelot or Guenivere or the Questing Beast.  What you WILL find is the essence of the Grail story.  Parry (Robin Williams) is Percival the Fool as well as The Fisher King himself; Jack (Jeff Bridges) is a fallen king-of-radio.  Both are wounded and in a related manner.  Neither faces his problems head on.  Each needs another to pave the way to forgiveness, acceptance, and redemption.  The ultimate physical object that leads to this may be a swimming trophy, but it is also the Holy Grail itself.  Why?  Because it truly is, if you only believe.

3800	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I was utterly rivetted by this film when I saw it in '77.  It had no shoot'em up alien stuff, but instead is an extremely subtle exploration of first open contact with alien explorers.  THere is a lot of humor and mystery in it, unexplained things that come together in the end in a wonderful and optimistic climax.  I found it a powerful emotional experience then, and seeing it nearly 30years later - with my kids, who were also fully engaged in the mystery and mood of it - equally satisfying (ok, a bit slow at time for them as they are used to star wars action and pace).  Indeed, this is one of the best sci-fi films I have ever seen.

1328	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This film is more than a portrait of a choreographer. It is a portrait of his company. And of the small, not-for-profit arts institution in America. From beginning to end the viewer gets a glimpse of what it takes for such an institution to survive and remain creative in an environment that doesn't always appreciate innovation and creativity. Director Matthew Diamond (himself a former dancer and choreographer) has done an excellent job of interweaving rehearsal and live performances with archival footage and talking heads (dance critics, administrative staff, technical crew, dancers, former dancers, and Taylor himself all get their say). Taylor comes across, in turns, as impish (fabricating stories to please the press), vague (struggling to communicate new steps to his dancers), nervous (constantly chewing gum), fearful ("my inspiration comes from fear"), and autocratic (in the course of the film he fires one of his dancers). But most of all, Taylor comes across as insecure and vulnerable. One especially telling moment in the film comes when the company is performing in India and the sound system fails. The dancers continue dancing in silence while the crew busies itself trying to fix the problem. The music comes back on and the company is in perfect sync. Taylor revealingly says, "My dance was ruined. And they were the heroes, not me. They stole the show." As one former company member put it when describing Taylor's origins: "There was [Martha] Graham and then there was this big dysfunctional family, and Paul Taylor was one of them....And they all brought their own dysfunction to their own companies."
Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.

1069	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	I wouldn't call myself a Woody Allen fan but I thought this film was simply hilarious and most of the jokes and gags hold up well even today and if you like off-beat humour ala "There's Something About Mary" or even "Saturday Night Live" you will find a lot to like about this film.  The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.
Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who seems to have gotten his training in guerrilla warfare or at least as a member of the Green Berets.

5574	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	One of the few mainstream horror films from the 80's that is still great to this day is the original Fright Night.  Helmed by Tom Holland (who would go on to direct the original Child's Play), Fright Night contains all the familiar elements and conventions of the vampire film genre, but thanks to Holland's energetic direction, great cast work, and some great (mostly) makeup effects, Fright Night succeeds where most others fail, and is a fun horror classic.  William Ragsdale stars as Charley, a horror loving teen who suspects his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire.  Soon enough, Charley's suspicians prove true, and with the help of an eccentric B-horror movie actor (Roddy McDowell), he sets out to stop the powerful vamp as his family, friends, and girlfriend (Married...With Children's Amanda Bearse) are threatened.  With tried but true conventions and everything else mentioned above, Fright Night may not be the best vampire movie you'll ever see, but it's certainly one of the most fun.

Of course, the point is that the joy of falling lies in its illusion of timelessness.  Thus, once we land and our loving thereafter plateaus, proceeding without further falling, we are faced with the dreadful prospect that love (unlike falling into it) is transient.  It eventually ends (by betrayal, taking for granted, or death).  This is where this movie takes us so starkly-- the transitoriness of the rivers of time.  The flow even gives us the impression of concrete gifts in the fish it grants the skilled angler, but anyone who has kept fish too long before consuming it knows oh so well how transitory that gift of the waters is.  Fishing, therefore, draws us right into the middle of that transitoriness.  The film teaches us that however permanent our happiness might seem when we are falling, a river always runs through it . . . a river of time.
But the results are one heck of an entertaining movie.  I love their girl empowerment message and the comedy bits that pepper this movie.  You have to listen close sometimes for little inside jokes and that also makes it fun.

There is not one false note in this movie.  The screenplay, courtesy of a whopping FIVE writers (which usually spells disaster for most movies), sticks very close to reality.  We get a sense that these characters are three-dimensional and REAL, and not merely functions of the plot.  The tension between the estranged wife (played by Sarandon) and the title character (played by Julia Roberts) is palpable and believable, with no one being made the saint nor the villian.  These characters have virtues and faults just like anybody else. They also have clear reasons and MOTIVATIONS for the way they feel, and for the things they do.  Ed Harris, as the man standing between the woman he loves and the woman he once loved (and still cares very much for), also rings true in his performance and makes us feel the inner tensions felt by his character.  I even liked the two young actors playing the kids, and the way their parts were written: these are real kids with real feelings and emotions, and are not just there to look and act cute.  They are caught in an uncomfortable situation not of their making, and we really feel for them.

It is not, of course, a perfect film, earlier scenes are somewhat too broad in portrayal of the impact on Dreyfuss' imagination as to what such a 'close encounter' might actually entail. Richard Dreyfuss gets solo billing in the brief introductory credits at the beginning of the movie: quite an actor's coup but recognition of the weight put on his performance in sustaining most of the film. Two important female roles are well played  as are a number of other key ones. All in all, still watchable after all these years

5547	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the most memorable horror movies from the 80s, not because it was super scary or anything but because it was such a fun vampire flick. Charlie [William Ragsdale] is a horror buff who is convinced that his new next-door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge is a vampire. He tries to convince his girlfriend Amy [Amanda Bearse] and his best friend Evil to no avail. His last hope is Peter Vincent [Roddy McDowall] a TV actor who plays a vampire killer. The rest of the story deals with their efforts in tracking down and killing the vampire. The acting here is above average, and each character is memorable. William Ragsdale brings a certain earnestness to his role as Charlie, and Amanda Bearse plays the role of love interest to Charlie & Dandridge convincingly. However, the best role is the one of Jerry Dandridge, played most convincingly by Chris Sarandon. He is wickedly evil, with a wry sense of humor and dashing countenance. The storyline may have flaws in it, but this is just a fun vampire movie that should be enjoyed for what it is.

It has inspired numerous filmmakers and further established the career of Robert De Niro as one of the preeminent actors of our time.  The story is about Travis Bickle (De Niro) who, to quote Pauline Kael's review, "has no point of entry into human society."  Bickle turns to his violent fantasies after a campaign worker (Cybill Shepherd) rejects him- and thus his final attempt to connect with other people.  This culminates in a famous scene of heinous violence. But just because a film is about disconnection doesn't necessarily mean that it has to diconnect its audience.  Ultimately, that's how I felt.

The others in the cast are in top form also; John Malkovitch,  Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway all give wonderful performances.  The  photography is stunning, the battles are exhilarating.  And yet the movie  falls short because of the poor presentation.  There was no real  connection, flow, or even story line between the battle sequences and her  dream sequences.  The editing fell short in tying the remarkable individual  elements into one sensible theme.  As another reviewer mentioned, it would  have been better if this movie had less going for it from the start, such  as the superb acting and extraordinary visuals.  By the time we get toward  the end of the movie when her conscious appears, I just wanted the movie to  end.

I especially love the period when the Bellamy family and the downstairs family are going through WWI; Mrs. Bridges & Ruby going to a War Cookery lecture and making "Win the War Pie" for the servant's meal; it is nearly inedible to all but Ruby & Mrs. Bridges. So many wonderful moments and the series comes to the right ending. The film has faded to a degree, but pretty much looks the way I remember it in the 70s when first shown here.

He is backed by several other strong actors, including a rather young Glenn Close acting as Vice President.

The song and dance numbers, too, are a phenomenol addition to this film. A few original new songs are added to this version, including "We've Got Annie" and "Dumb Dog" (which I personally didn't love and found to be a bit out of place, but it was still pretty cute). There are clearly professional dancers and talented voices galore to accompany every song, making it an ideal musical experience for the whole family.
  The acting is wonderful, led by Gordon Jackson (as Hudson, the butler), David Langton (as Richard Bellamy), and Jean Marsh (as house parlormaid Rose Buck).  Marsh also originated and guided the series.  These three characters seem like rocks, upon which the waves of the social changes beat.  Yet they are worn and changed by the events of this incredible era.  Nonetheless, this is very much an ensemble cast--no character appears in more than 60 of the 68 episodes.
Michael Chapman's cinematography is also first-rate. His use of lighting combined with Scorsese's unique direction and his occasional utilization of slow motion gives the film a very surreal look.

The first is the story itself. This is a brilliant character study. We are given a wonderful glimpse into the life of Andrea, a young woman coming to grips with her womanhood, her adulthood and her sexuality. She learns, as the film teaches the audience, that while linked the three are distinctly different. Andrea learns to differentiate between the states of her heart, her body and her mind. She learns that she can't allow herself to be ruled by the her emotions, her sexual desires or her pragmatism alone but instead must live her life by holding all three in a delicate balance.

It's a change for the better in terms of this 1957 film, which isn't a classic (Joey's plight still isn't particularly compelling, despite the alterations), but nevertheless comes to life whenever one of Rodgers and Hart's songs appear on the soundtrack: "The Lady is a Tramp," "I Could Write a Book," and "My Funny Valentine" are just a few of the duo's classic songs crooned by Sinatra and the vocal stand-ins for co-stars Rita Hayworth (as a former stripper who enables Joey to run his own night club) and Kim Novak (as the "good" chorus girl who tries in vain to reform Joey's ways). As Julie Kirgo points out, some of the songs aren't from "Pal Joey" but other Rogers-Hart shows including "On Your Toes" and "Babes in Arms" among others, but they help to augment a film version, scripted by Dorothy Kingsley, that's dated in its own way.

At the time of the storys setting, America had retreated from Vietnam, the Watergate scandal and Nixons impeachment trial had unfolded, Woodstock had been replaced by Altamont, and a mood of severe cynicism permeated the US.  Capturing this mood of cynicism, isolation and anger perfectly, the film depicts De Niros character as a Vietnam Veteran working nights as a cab driver because he cant sleep anyhow.  It shows his progressive deterioration from anger and loneliness to one of those insane murderers who haunt our national psyche.  The story has some interesting plot twists which I won't reveal to anyone else who, like me a month ago, still hasn't gotten around to viewing it.  Its perhaps the best depiction of the mind of a deranged killer that Ive seen on film, and is on many lists of the best films ever made.  It deserves to be there.

As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.
2378	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I actually just bought this DVD a few days ago.  I was fairly astounded at the visual quality of the movie, even in full screen mode.  The sound was nothing to marvel at (the gunshots, however, did sound really defined on my 5.1 surround sound system).  But I didn't buy the movie for Ford, the sound, or even the amazing clarity of its visuals.  I really bought Air Force One because of its supporting cast and its "in your face" directorial style (Wolfgang Petersen's trademark).  From William H. Macy to Gary Oldman to Glen Close to many others, this movie really shines in its supporting cast (the plane included, who gives a stunning performance, without even a stunt double).  However, an outstanding supporting cast does usually mean that the lead role (or roles) isn't doing his or her job.  I think that's the only area where this movie fails to be convincing.
By the way, Gere must have been a difficult 'act' to work with because he and Debra Winger were at odds in Officer and a Gentleman, and there was a variety of production problems in Coppola'a "The Cotton Club" (as the story goes).  I'd assume Gere had something to do with that too.
The cast consists mostly of young talents but the older actors turn in some scene stealing performances as well.  Francis Ng, who owns every role he takes, stands out as gang boss Lok.  He possesses an intensity that keeps his character believable without giving into parody.  (Beware Jackie Chan fans; he produced the movie and only appears for a one minute cameo at the end.)
The majority of the movie, to no one's surprise, consists of the team members trying to survive the onslaught of hordes of zombies, high-tech computer defenses of last resort, etc.  As all of that exciting action is taking place, however, we see Alice trying to sort through the memories coming back to her in intermittent waves.  She is a much more central figure in all of this than even she knows early on, and she isn't the only team member with secrets to be revealed.  That leads to some surprisingly effective plot twists that not only advanced the story in important and plausible ways; they were also presented very much in the context of earlier scenes in the movie.

673	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	I love how all of these Rankin/Bass classics from the 60s and 70s get classic old Hollywood and Broadway stars to provide voice talents; lends a certain seriousness to the occasion.  Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word "Claus" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.
"Gattaca" is a masterpiece of science fiction -- a richly nuanced, beautifully understated work that reminds you that, no matter where we come from, we can all reach for the stars.
Gere is always good as the wild card cop and/or loner type, and he will do just about anything to find the murder witness (Basinger).  Could she be involved more than we know?  Well, the race to the conclusion may be visible from an hour away but the ride is entertaining enough with the attractive leads in good form (Basinger really does do that "shaking rage, so tired of being pushed around and manipulated fury" well...).

But alas, there is no I in "reminiscing." Well, it's a metaphor. If you just have to be that niggly about it, there are three, but I meant the higher I that it doesn't have, in that metaphoric way. Well, it's my metaphor and it means what I said it means. What do you mean, what I mean? I mean - I mean that you mean what I mean, but not the way you mean it. What do you mean, that you don't mean what I said you mean that I mean? I meant that I meant that you meant that ... never mind.
Another theme that runs through all three of these films is a sense of loneliness. The number on the bus that Christopher lived in depicted in INTO THE WILD is number 142. Numerologically, this adds up to a number 7 - the number of solitude and loneliness. In EASY RIDER, the character played by Peter Fonda ends up all alone in a New Orleans cemetery, perched atop a statue of the Virgin Mary while he's peaking on LSD in a death-rebirth acid trip-induced mystical experience, screaming out in tears to his real dead mother and asking her why she killed herself, leaving him all alone. In THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, you find Ernesto feeling more and more isolated from his friend and feeling lonely after he receives the "Dear John letter" from his girlfriend who they had visited just weeks before. His sense of loss and isolation is profound. His shattered dream of a romantic relationship with this woman cleared the path to true enlightenment for him. The viewer can sense this profoundly at the end of the film when you see him saying goodbye to Alberto before getting alone onto the aeroplane waiting to take him away toward his ultimate destiny. All three of these characters experienced major spiritual transformations along their journey out on the road of life far away from home.

Jerry Dandridge played by Chris Sarandon plays his character with real relish in his many-sided performance, so very well, from the debonair bachelor, seducer and blood sucking monster. A pretty funny film, which I believe has stood the test of time.

Another thing I didn't care for--this had relatively few cool futuristic gadgets and gizmos.  The cars looked retro, but they made a cool humming sound as they sped past.  The cops didn't have any laser guns or sweet tracking devices.  Nobody had cell phones.  No teleportation tubes with dialethium crystals or electronic floatation devices?  Nothing really.  Bummer.
Although the fighting sequence is not as long  and as many as Braveheart, it does hold it's own.

6170	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	This one is an all-time favorite and a long-time resident of my home video library.  Comedy legend Steve Martin, in a way that only Steve Martin can, plays the role of the emotionally and intellectually-wealthy goblin of a man who falls for the equally emotionally and intellectually-wealthy blonde bombshell (Daryl Hannah--hey, why not?) who visits his small town.  Unfortunately, this bombshell is lacking in the common sense department, because she immediately falls for the beefcake village idiot, played convincingly by Rick Rossovich.  Go figure.  But what happens as a result of this scenario is altogether funny, charming, touching and totally entertaining.  This movie flows.  Martin compounds his genius in the movie by assembling a stellar supporting cast (which includes Shelley Duvall and a young Damon Wayans) that more than holds its own throughout the film.  Pay extra special attention to the balcony scene--from its beginning to its end, Martin and Rossovich are allowed to shine their brightest.  Martin teams up for this 'Cyrano' retelling with director Fred Schepisi, the visionary behind 'Six Degrees of Separation', the movie that first separated Wil Smith from his legendary "Fresh Prince" persona.  'Roxanne' gets the highest possible recommendation for its perfect balance of humor and romance and the stellar performance of its entire cast.

3299	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Unfortunately, many people have placed Steel Magnolias in the chick-flick category, even my most favorite critic. But as a matter of honest opinion, to place it in such a small subject field is an insult to the film. As Fried Green Tomatoes did in the latter years, Steel Magnolias show's how strong relationships can be. To know how important it is to remain steadfast with your friend's, so they are there when you need them. Through humor, this film version of the play displays the caring qualities between a lovable bunch of nag's. With the griping and gossip that they spring, you hear their form of hilarious communication. Based on a true heartbreaking story, the screenwriter has done a terrific job choreographing the language between the six ladies to show the up's and down's of life, and being a diabetic. ("Shelby's" character, portrayed by Julia Robert's, is in fact the screenwriter's sister. My heart goes out to him.) The DVD is everything it should be, and makes it even more enjoyable than the old scratchy copy I had. I don't like admitting everything to the whole world, but if a story comes along that is very uplifting and yet sad, I can usually hold back the water works.

Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when "The Avengers" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from "The Avengers'" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish.

I bought this series as a gift and it made it look like I bought some slightly irregular box set on clearance, instead of getting a quality set like I assumed I was gifting, which was highly embarassing.  So if you're buying it for someone else, keep it in mind that they're going to be disappointed.

With this disc you get 3 different versions of the film, you get the theatrical release, a special version and the Directors cut.  I chose the Director's Cut as if it is what Spielberg envisioned and not the studios, then that I what I want to see. The theatrical version clocks in at 135 minutes, while the Special Edition clocks in at 132 minutes and the Director's Cut at 137minutes.  The Audio for all 3 versions is DTS MA 5.1 lossless audio for English and French, while the Spanish viewer gets lossless Dolby True HD 5.1.  Since both lossless codecs are very good and significantly better than any lossy audio codec, I do not believe that anyone could tell the difference, but more on the audio later on.

GATTACA is a science-fiction film, but unlike the science-fantasy people have come to associate with the genre (Star Trek and Star Wars for instance), it focuses on the ideas of the possible and their implications rather than on silly monsters and overblown special effects. You could say that GATTACA is at its heart a 1984-style tale of a dystopian future, but the effect of slightly altered reality is so perfectly subtle (the only differences between our world and this one is frequent rocketship launches, faster computers, electric vehicles, and a stylishly retro feel) that it may be the exquisite camerawork and cinematography (with a slight yellow-green tint to everything) that ultimately gives you the feeling that something in this world of tomorrow is not-quite-right.

As much as we love the series, we are WAY in the minority here.  At best, the individual seasons would sell for $15 to $20.

It feels so self-important and plodding. The pace is slow and the special effects no longer have the power to stun. And the movie doesn't really surprise.  There is no ultimate mystery to the plot.  Yes, one might wonder what the aliens are like, but we never doubt that they're there, that Dreyfuss will get to see them and that nothing bad will happen.  The movie never builds up any truly engrossing tension.  We feel safe throughout, and wouldn't you think that the world, getting ready to see aliens for the first time, would feel more frightened (and the viewer more frightened)?

9856	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is a "love child" - that is, he was conceived (at some time in the techno-marvel future) without benefit of the genetic engineering utilized by all sensible parents in this New Age. While this engineering cannot transform ordinary DNA into extraordinary DNA, it can eliminate potential genetic flaws, select for sex and appearance, and generally ensure that Baby represents the Best Of Mom And Dad. Vincent's parent's failure to utilize this technology results in a baby who is horribly nearsighted, and who has a serious heart defect that projects a lifespan of only 30 years. This DNA profile places Vincent close to the bottom of the social, economic, and professional scale in the New Age, where opportunity is linked to a great set of genes.  Vincent's chastened parents don't make the same mistake with their second baby, and place their hopes on their younger son, giving Vincent embarrassed, qualified affection, and little in the way of goals, expectations, or hope.

The DVD Report
From Minority Report to Brazil to Blade Runner, there's always films that take place in the future and possibly offer a glimpse into what it could be like. Some offer a post-apocalyptic version, others are more ambitious and colorful and then there's Gattaca. Besides the genetics thing and a couple things, there's not a lot to suggest this is a radically different world and it works. Instead of being very out there with the technology advancements, this one seems more plausible and just as chilling. The idea of a perfect human seems to recall a certain much hated man from the 1940's who had an idea of a master race. While it's not implied at all in the film, it does seem kind of a different way to go about making humans more perfect.

Seriously, folks.  You need to go out and see REAL films and not just hokey sequels or dumb wannabes.  RE is pathecticly shown and scripted.  The entire movie is basically "Aliens" in an underground office space that looks like the headquarters for Washington Mutual bank company than a secret organization, with Zombies, mutant dogs and a grumpy computer.  Oh, and as for the mutants?  The zombies look more like homeless bums with horrible teeth hygene than flesh eating monsters.  The mutant dogs are just Dobermens with Halloween make-up on their faces.  As for the rest of the mutants, like the "Hunters" and "Lickers"?  Well, let's just say that Rick Baker must be turning in his grave...wait a minute...nevermind.  The "Lickers" in the RE video-game were much better, were as in the film, they're piles of doo-doo that have the intelligence of a pasture cow.  The "Hunters" in the video-game version kicked butt totally, with their pumped-up bodies and bad attitute, were as in the film (this has to be the cheapest idea I've ever heard), they are actually "Lickers" evolved...where ...did that come from???  The CGI in this film is absolutely terrible.  It looks like it was done on a home computer!!!  The characters are terribly one-dimensional and have no purpose...either than to be eaten alive by monsters.  What really ticked me off was the fact that some characters in the film get close to death in one scene that is very pulse-pounding, survive, only to be mutalated anti-climatically 10 minutes later.  It was as if the director was sitting in his chair and constantly his assistant would come up to him and ask "So...do we kill him now?" and he would say "Nah, better wait a few more minutes".  This was totally annoying.  I absolutely hated Jovovich's character for her lack of common sense.  Ofcourse, these days, if you want to make a action film, gotta put in stupid "Matrix"-style moves.  God, am I getting sick of that same formula of action!!!!  How is it that you can jump against a wall and kick a dog in mid-air motion?  Please!  Probably the worse thing by far in this flick was the ending......
In the "Age of the Da Vinci Code" -- another far less successful Grail story --  I'd be happy to see folks go back to Monty Python for their understanding of medieval literature and Chrisitainity. Maybe they'd learn that all enigmas are not meant to be solved; some are meant to be the topic of cleansing and cathartic laughter.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is magnificent filmmaking that holds up beautifully after thirty years.  Though his SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) are mature adult works of art, Spielberg still has no equals for creating great popular movie entertainment for kids of all ages--like the INDIANA JONES trilogy.

On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.

"Taxi Driver's" inimitable success is rooted in its two most prominent and seemingly conflicting elements: De Niro's brilliant, empathetic and real lead performance alongside Scorsese's expressionistic, overblown visuals.  Countless films have portrayed the city, and New York City in particular, as a hellish netherworld, but few do so as absolutely and convincingly as "Taxi Driver".  The NYC of "Taxi Driver" is a blinding, neon-lit freakshow of streetwalkers, killers and (worst of all) politicians where the billowing steam rises from sewer vents to hide the squalor in an opaque mist and the rain pours forever down.  Few viewers are liable to be too fond of what they see in this unreal city, and neither does Travis Bickle, our tortured anti-hero and one of the most memorable characters in all film.  Schrader deserves a lot of credit for conceiving Bickle so brilliantly, but few actors, if any, could've brought life to his contradictory yet somehow understandable personality like Robert De Niro.  These three figures, Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro, are the core of the film, but almost everything else comes together to perfection as well.

The film focuses on the Harrison family: Luke (Ed Harris), Jackie (Susan Sarandon), and their two children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken). The wealthy New York family has all of the love, but all of the fights, especially those which have come from Luke and Jackie's past divorce. Luke's new love interest, and fianc, is Isabel (Julia Roberts), a stylish, young, New York City photographer. She has absolutely no motherly experience, and is really not ready to be a stepmom, especially since the two children are indisputably close to their very maternal mother Jackie. From this, a slight feud between Jackie and Isabel comes about. Isabel is unhappy of how Jackie sees her as so irresponsible and careless, while Jackie is not ready to be replaced by someone with no parental experience. But after the family learns devastating news concerning Jackie's health, Isabel and Jackie must learn to get along, whether they are going to share motherhood or not.


The DVD has good picture and sound plus an interesting little 'making of' the film as an extra.
The Blu-ray uses an interactive comparison feature "A View from Above" that has a pop up color/shape to tell you when there is a difference in a scene. It is color co-ordinated to which version has a difference and also to which version you are watching. It shows an image from the scene and explains what was altered. We also geta hard copy of that as well for both the Blu-ray and DVD with a "map" explaining the differences between the three versions and, on the other side, a reproduction of the original, effective poster (which also was used as a teaser trailer and is on the cover of the box)from 1977.

I still love the movie, but it didn't follow very much of the game and the zombies were not scary looking!  The action is really good though.  I don't recall bein HIGH or anything, but i remember seein some of the same zombies in different scenes.  They die and then they come back for more later in the movie.  That was pretty strange.  Plus, there was barely any gore in the film.  Movies with zombies, mean movies with a ton of BLOOD AND GUTS!  I just saw the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD in theaters, and it makes R.E. look like a kiddie movie (rated G or PG).  The musical score of the movie, done by Marylin Manson, was AWESOME!  That kept the movie in a steady state of COOLNESS!  The acting was good too.  I love watchin Milla (Alice) runnin around (...)

3260	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	After many years, I watched this film again a couple of days ago. It continues to be a touching and great women's story. Whenever it came to my mind, I remembered Sally Field's performance as Shelby's mother, M'Lynn, always  giving love and support to her daughter even against her will and mother's feelings. All actresses were great, but my favourite charater will be always Sally Field's.
5148	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	I believe this movie will be remembered for a long time.  It didn't make the "bang" with the public that it should have, but that's ok, it would have detracted from the whole ambiance of the film about enthusiastic  criminal-wannabes.
First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.
Unfortunately the set  I got had alot of background noise on it, but I muddled through regardless!
Fans of Luc Besson will like this film for its modern-day  approach to a medieval story, and its oft-misunderstood protagonist. With  that said, I think that some of the imagery goes way "over the  top" for the period piece it is attempting to represent. I was left  wishing that Joan's visions were shown with more subtlety and respect for  the viewer. Overall, the story is interesting, but its exposition is  heavy-handed. The featurette on the DVD explains the incredible amount of  detail-oriented research that went into the film - research which is often  undermined by blazing, colorful, thoroughly-modern hallucinations. I really  wanted a good, cohesive story of Joan-of-Arc. With a little subtlety, this  could have been a highly rewarding movie. There are still great themes to  be had in this film, but you'll have to get past Besson's flair for  exhibitionism if you want to explore them.
This movie was the worst zombie film I have seen next to RE Apocalypse. This movie isn't worth buying, it isn't worth renting, it isn't worth the DVD is was burned to. Save you cash and your time.

Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.

  I don't want to give an explanation of what happens in the movie, rather to present an inidividual understanding.  Many have dismissed Taxi Driver as a film which goes nowhere, and have called it too artsy.  My interpretation differs.  Certainly, it is not a unique film, but the feelings of loneliness and social awareness that DeNiro brings to his role are interesting.  DeNiro may be thought of as a modern day Steppenwolf-a man completely alienated from his surroundings.  Note, for example, the scene where he sits in the cafe with his collegues.  His inability to communicate at even the most superficial level demonstrates his alienation from his surroundings, but also arouses the sympathy of the viewers.
The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.
2258	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	4.0	Of course "AF1" has more plot holes than a Jerry Bruckheimer film, but watching this movie back in 1997 was one of the biggest cinema joys in recent years! "AF1" is a MUST for all Ford fans, as well as fans of action. Wolf Petersen is one of my favorite directors, he makes this movie 'take off' and really 'fly' with excitement. I also should say, Gary Oldman is probably the greatest working film actor today who has never been nominated for an Oscar, (as far as I know). I'm not saying "AF1" is 'Oscar material' but I'd rather watch this than something like "The Last Emperor". "AF1" may go down in my book as Harrison Ford's last great action role, so what if it's unbelievable? Almost a classic. It has it's flaws but is an otherwise very memorable film."

The Nemesis looks just like he was taken out of the games, which is pretty cool, as does Jill.  Carlos' hair is not as long as it was in the games, but that is fine.  Alice looks pretty cool, and she is like a female version of Wesker from Code Veronica.  There is even a cool battle scene between Alice and the Nemesis.  The outcome is unexpected, but it is possible.  Of course, not all the characters are cool.

Great movie to watch and learn lot more than we can expect.
The second commentary is by the film's screenwriter Paul Schrader. He points out Travis' contradictory nature - he talks about purifying his body yet he also takes speed. There are several lulls during this commentary but he more than makes up for it with some excellent observations about the film and the nature of screenwriting.

It's a real shame that George Romero left the project of directing this movie; I'm sure he would have done a great job. But he had his reasons of not participating; most probably he read the awful script and was discouraged. So why did I give this movie 2 stars? Hmmm, well probably because Milla Jovovich is a real hottie. As a matter of fact, it's thanks to her that I remained to see the movie till the very end. Cause some smart people know that if you're going to make an awful movie, at least bring in the hottie who will make teenagers fall in love and increase the marketing of their product. The same thing can be said to "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider".

There's a violence to ``Air Force One'' that's simply not present in the more cartoonish action films. Bullets rip nasty holes into doors, and the sound of gunshots in the confined space of the presidential plane is a jolt. Oldman's enjoyment in murdering defenseless people makes the violence more personal and frightening. Director Wolfgang Petersen's action fantasy escalates into midair dogfights and elaborate stunts that have people dangling from the Air Force One parachute ramp and later trying to transfer via a cable to a rescue aircraft. There is a tone of confident military heroics and almost a reverence for the presidency that seem a throwback to World War II propaganda movies. ``Air Force One'' might not be the role of Ford's career, but it might be the ultimate role of his maturity.

Everything about 'Gattaca,' technically, is top-notch. Despite having a modest budget, the filmmakers have creatively created a utopia with minimal CGI effects. All set locations are simply dressed up or down to get the effect of a not to distant future, and it works wonderfully.
Already in my wishlist.  I am SO glad they are being released.  i didn't want to shell out $$$ for the complete series since I own Seasons 1-4.
On a narrative level, these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth nature of the trial, but it would have probably been much better to have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions. There are still some compensations. The trial is well-handled, and Timothy West avoids the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns (cf Cry Freedom) to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped in an impossible situation, very similar to Ray MacAnally's role in The Mission. It's not a flawless film by any means, but it is one of the better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that's long overdue for reappraisal.
The strength of the film is that Jack regresses to his old arrogant self and denies the homeless folks he has befriended and even denies, Mercedes Ruehl, the woman who is devoted to him and helped him arrange the date between Parry and Amanda Plummer's character.

Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.
On her way to her high school reunion, Beth Cappadora is told by her husband that if her head wasn't attached to her, she would lose it quickly. This provides a short laugh, while also setting up what is to come. At the reunion, she leaves her three-year-old son Ben in the care of his older brother Vincent, only to come back moments later and realize that he is gone. Hysterics grow, and after a thorough search of the building, he is nowhere to be found. Surrounded by family and friends, Beth begins to cope with her mistake as the community gets involved in the search for Ben, without success. Resigned to the fact that he will never be found, she returns home, and while the first steps to coping with what has happened are rocky, the family seems to be getting along well after the passage of nine years. They have moved to a new house in a new town, her husband has the restaurant he always wanted... A knock on the door turns everything upside down. Beth immediately recognizes the boy as her son, and is relieved and confused that he lives only two blocks away from their new residence. The authorities get involved, and soon Ben is taken from the only home he can remember and placed in a new and somewhat emotionally frightening setting where he is called by a name he does not know and lives with people he does not remember or feel much for.

Parry, even more so than Jack, is tormented by psychological demons.  He is connected to Jack in a horrific way, one that I am loath to divulge here.  A former university professor, Parry has taken on the insane alter ego of a homeless knight.  Williams shines in this role, his boundless energy and improvisational spirit giving some much needed light to what could have been a dark character.  Not that the darkness doesn't shine through.  Parry, stalked by a mysterious Red Knight riding an unholy steed, has a series of near breakdowns.  Williams has to show both the unbalanced side of Parry, and the one that used to exist, functioning within society.  He does well on both counts.  (N.B., the movie takes on greater meaning when you realize that Parry is short of Parsifal, an important character in another story about the search for the Holy Grail; recommended reading)
In time, he does learn to adapt better and begins to cope--until he's within 53 days of his scheduled release date for possession.  A sudden legal reversal, however, shifts his sentence to a full 30 years--for smuggling--and he is thrown into a vortex of despair.  And that's when he explodes.  As does the movie.

Based on a book written by a man who committed a crime in another land, went to trial, was convicted and imprisoned, eventually escaped, and wrote a book about his experiences, a lot of controversy seems to be generated over the whether or not various events in the film actually happened.  Given Hollywood's penchant for changing elements in stories so that they may best come across the screen, I decided, even though the film was based on a true story, to take that with a grain of salt and just watch the film as a film.

Of course no one believes him, especially his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse, "Married with Children") and his buddy "Evil" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys, "Heaven Help Us").

I think the film's use of Dustin Hoffman as Joan Of Arc's conscience was very well done. I noticed in other reviews, that several people found Hoffman's role to be confusing.

Luc Besson achieved directorial greatness more than once, but this film is the peak of his creative vision and success. Casting Ukrainian supermodel Milla Jovovich was a controversial idea at the time, but Besson managed to extract a nuanced performance from her - a feat, considering she is in virtually every frame of this 3-hour epic. To me, this is the greatest `war hero' film ever made - yes, even better than "Braveheart", "Alexander", or "Saving Private Ryan". In fact, the superiority of this motion picture far eclipses the achievements garnered by those films.

8813	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Bronson's magnum opus and proof positive that actions speaks louder than words. Bronson is at his taciturn best in the central role of an ageing 1930's depression street fighter, whose plans don't stretch beyond the 'next bend in the road'. In the acutely rendered hard times of the period: Bronson, James Coburn (gambling debt ridden fight manager) and Strother Martin (drunk ex medical student trainer) team up to outwit and outfight local big shot fight promoters, debt collectors and street fighters in a series of debt laden bare knuckle fights. Love interest is provided by various distaff girlfriends (including Bronson's real life wife Jill Ireland), whose relationships with the trio last about as long as the realistic fights - not long. The New Orleans locations and authentic period details of contrasting poverty and wealth add gritty realism to the hard fights that follow. In hard times actions also speak louder than music. The musical score is unobtrusive and except for a Cajun southern gumbo musical riff unremarkable. I will guarantee though that fans of the main characters and realistic street fight movies won't be disappointed. A man's man film. Five stars.

You not only get to watch the movie, but the extras are the best, funniest,and most plentiful of any DVD I have ever seen.  The most notable extras are the theatrical trailer, the Lego "Camelot" scene, and the educational video on how to use coconuts.  Without a doubt, it is worth the extra money.

It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it does deliver on its promise to scare, titillate, and tickle.  Add this 80's classic to the list of really fun B-movies: Flash Gordon, Lost Boys, Buckaroo Bonzai, Vamp, Easy Money, American Werewolf in London, Motel Hell . . . ah, those were the days.  Rather than repeat what many viewers have already said, I'll just give you my favorite scene: Evil Ed, Pencil in the Head.
Secrets are hidden behind a closed 3rd floor, a female, a dangerous person. Jane is even required to stop a murder. It is the inner struggle of mature emotion that makes Jane Eyre such a compulsive story, written by Charlotte Bronte as one of her finest novel works.

This is the second zombie picture this year after "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & fourth zombie picture of 2002-2004. Included in that list is "28 Days Later" (2003) & the original "Resident Evil" (2002). It is the third best zombie picture of 2002-2004, behind "28 Days Later" (2003) & "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004). Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, one of the two survivors of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), send to check something that went wrong in the hive hidden underneath Raccoon City, who is now trying to find a way to escape the city. Jovovich's performance is excellent, an improvement on her original performance for "Resident Evil" (2002). The cast is very promising. Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, a rogue member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), looking for a way to get out of the city, as well. Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, one of three soldiers trapped in the city. Thomas Kretschmann as Major Cain, the commander of the command center in the safe zone and one of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. Sophie Vavasseur as Angie Ashford, daughter of Dr. Charles Ashford, a doctor whose research was used for biological weaponry, who is missing somewhere in the city.

Mike Epps as L.J., a man whose in the right place at the wrong time. Sandrine Holt as Terri Morales, a reporter lost in the city looking for her big break. Matthew G. Taylor as Nemesis, the second survivor of Alice's elite group, whose real name is Matt Addison, who was transformed into Umbrella Corp's new creation. Zack Ward as Nicholai Sokolov, the second of the three soldiers trapped in the city and Olivera's right-hand man. Iain Glen as Dr. Isaacs, second of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. This is an excellent zombie pic in between "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & "Resident Evil" (2002). The directing by Alexander Witt (who was the cinematographer for "Hollywood Homicide" (2002), whose taking over for Paul W.S.

His obsession leads to violence when he purchases weapons and attempts to assassinate Palantine, but runs away almost as if, at the last moment, coming to his senses.

For the special edition of the DVD, the five living Pythons put together a handful of extra bits. The best extras are the audio tracks. You hear the directors talk about set design, John Cleese complains about being wet and cold, and Michael Palin explains why everything is funny. The documentary in which the two Terrys (the directors) visit the old filming locations is fun, too. They still have their sense of humor about it all. If you like to laugh, you should buy this DVD and watch it over and over until you've memorized every line. If you don't like to laugh, you are a very strange person.

I was recently talking to a friend of mine at work when we happened to run into each other in the men's room. He asked me if I had ever seen the film EASY RIDER, and I answered that it was interesting and very synchronistic that he should ask me that because it was the last movie that I had just enjoyed watching at home on DVD. I said, "Man, you know, I was JUST watching that last week! I LOVE that movie. I wanted to get the deluxe edition but I could not find it anywhere, so I just picked up the regular one at GIANT (the local supermarket) in the bargain bin for nine bucks." My friend, Ian, then said, "I only own three movies in my collection: EASY RIDER, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, and INTO THE WILD. Have you seen the other two?" I answered that I had not and that I had always wanted to see the both of them, to which he quickly replied, "You can borrow mine, man. I'll bring them in tomorrow for you." "Hey, thanks a lot, man," I replied with gratitude, and we both went back to work.
8285	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	Horace Rumpole is a figure to set along side Sherlock Holmes and Robin Hood in the pantheon of great British creations. Is it drama? Is it comedy? It is both and along side the great man are a host of entertaining supporting figures such as Hilda Rumpole (She who must be obeyed), Claude Erskine Brown, Judge Bullingham (The Bull), Philippa Erskine Brown (The Porta of Chambers), Uncle Tom (who having no legal work plays golf in the office) Soapey Sam Ballard and Gutherie Featherstone, as well as various members of the criminal Timson family. Above all there is Horace Rumpole lover of the fried English breakfast, steak and kidney pudding, spotted dick, cheap claret, small cigars and poetry. It is an articule of faith that his clients never plead guilty and that Horace, who as it is pionted out knows nothing about the law, can sway a jury. Sadly Horace does not always win even when his clients are innocent. The stories are good and set in an England that no longer exists indeed never existed in the first place, that is to say an England of ecentric lawyers and lovable criminals. However the real reason to watch this series is to see Horace Rumploe played by the late great Leo McKern, with cigar ash down his waistcoat, making a fool of the most pompous of judges. So good is McKern's performance in playing this most English of figures you forget that Leo McKern was in fact an Australian.

And unlike virtually every DVD released, the all the extras are worth checking out and also boasts what I think is the only movie that offers for your listening pleasure a "Mono soundtrack in glorious old-fashioned mono!" Plus as an added bonus there is "A glorious 24 seconds absolutely free!" although don't ask me where that is from. There are also there rare audio commentaries that are actually interesting, one with Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones and another with John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin. Also there a plenty of great documentaries, three sin-alongs, and a cast directory to keep track of how many characters each actor played. And if you can't get enough ridiculousness, you can watch the film in Japanese with English Subtitles as they search for the holy sake cup and even a Lego version of the film. No seriously, well at least a scene of them. And there's even an educational film on to use your coconuts. And really, what else do you need in your life?

In the film, there are two brothers, Paul and Norman. The father, the Reverend MacLean teaches the two brothers how to cast a fishing rod. The two learned to cast with a four count rhythm, with a metronome playing. The narrator Norman says of his father: "If he had had his way, no one who did not know how to catch a fish, would be allowed to disgrace a fish by catching it." It becomes clear that this simple way to catch fish, using a four count rhythm, is graceful. If a fly-fisherman swings his rod too powerfully, it might become stuck in some trees. If he swings too weakly, it will never go into the stream where the fish are biting. But the four count rhythm method of casting, is "just right."

The scenery throughout the movie gave it a very creepy feel.  Even though the movie takes place in a high tech office building, it gave off a very haunted house feel to the picture.  Marilyn Manson's scored songs added greatly to the eeriness and would be a great addition to any haunted house.
This garbage, along with those ever-annoying Hansons, get my vote for the worst fads of the late '90s. Both "acts" are illogical, dull-witted, implausible, unreasoned, muddled, stupid, cloddish, thickheaded, nettlesome, maddening, harassing, and just plain flat out a waste of some perfectly good blank DVD's/CD's.

My favorite line these days when Slater punches the Leutenent Gov. in the face. "Call me when the Governor gets here," hilarious stuff now that Schwarzenegger is the California Govenator.
"Bottle Rocket" is a modest masterpiece.  Anderson and Wilson's script, with its Altmanesque scenes of overlapping dialogue, its obsession with the incidentals of the character's lives, and its knack for peculiar dialogue (Dignan, in an atypical moment of self-doubt, says, "He's out. And you're out, too. And I don't think I'm in, either. No gang!"), is just plain wonderful.  Anderson's direction shows the promise he would later fulfill.  And the acting, mainly by the Wilson brothers, but also by Musgrave, Cavazos, and Caan, is not as amateurish as I would have expected.  A fine, funny, friendly film, that shoots for the moon, but doesn't flare out quickly like the fireworks for which it is named.

Chaney is a drifter, riding the rails, and like everyone else struggling mightily during the Great Depression. He eventually ends up in New Orleans where he tries to build up a nest egg by engaging in bare knuckle brawls. He lands a shifty promoter named Speed, who at first looks him over and observes: "You look a little past it." As played by James Coburn, Speed is always working a hustle and flashes that toothy grin. Speed is a rogue, and he has an interesting dynamics with Chaney. Coburn and Bronson play off each other beautifully, Coburn's brash likable heel striking a nice counterpoint to Bronson's craggy -faced dude of few words.

The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire).  Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?
6803	Movies_and_TV_5	NEG	1.0	This film was, I'm sorry, [really bad]. I just can't see a point to it. In the game, all you do is walk around and shoot zombies; the film is exactly the same. There's just a bunch of guys walking around and killing zombies, and occasionally the zombies kill one of them. Every single moment of the film is a hundred percent predictable, so the 'plot twists' are obvious and the scary parts are simply not scary.

5179	Movies_and_TV_5	POS	5.0	"Taxi Driver", directed by Martin Scorcese, is a great psychotic and dark film about a man, Travis, who suffers from insomnia and begins his job as a taxi driver.  As he begins developing more psychotic thoughts, the plot becomes more interesting.  The several twists and turns keep audiences' eyes wide open for every second.  The grizzly streets of New York City offer a closer, more interesting look into every event.  Such dark theme makes this film ahead of its time; in fact, some may say it's also ahead of our time.  The multiple storylines keep the plot interesting the whole time, namely a woman, Betsy, he's obsessed with and a twelve-year-old prostitute, Iris (nickname "Easy"), that he wants to help.  This leads to a powerful conclusion.  The presented quality deserved its four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture of 1976.
