8808	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been a fan of Mario Badescu products for years, but mostly for preventing acne. Now that I'm older, I need to use moisturizing products. I'm happy to say that the Herbal Hydrating Serum has no scent. It's a gel serum that makes your face feel cool and smooth. This is a 1 oz bottle, but you only need a tiny amount to use. I used it over my moisturizer, but you can use it alone too. I'm impressed with this serum. Recommended.
8131	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm usually not one for perfumed face cleansers but every time I branch out from la Roche-Posay I find myself coming back soon after. I first came across the brand when my derm talked me into the Anthelios line for my fair skin. The sunscreens were awesome and when I started breaking out a few years later (not due to the sunscreen!) I turned to Effaclar. I go back and forth between this and the Mela-D, both are amazing. They are very very gentle cleansers that do an excellent job of deeply cleaning the skin without stripping it of too much moisture. Everytime I get a bout of acne I come back to Effaclar to get me back on the clear-skin track. The whole effaclar line is amazing but this cleanser is definitely holy grail status for me. It's a bit pricier than I like but it lathers so well that you need little more than a pea sized amount to thoroughly clean your face.
Helps calm cranky babies when you are outside and can't get indoors, or you are on an outside adventure. Most of the time it makes them laugh or at least distracted enough from their heat discomfort to allow the calming effects of the water spray to cool them.

There is also a wonderful little sharpener that accommodates the thin pencil.  The sharpener holds the pencil shavings until you dump them.
8880	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Smells good and has a nice moisturizing quality.
7286	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really recommend this powder to others.  I have acne prone skin (even at thirty) and have trouble finding a foundation that matches my skin tone (very fair) and that doesn't cause breakouts, all the while lasting the day.  An aesthetician recommended this to my in college and I stopped using it after my skin cleared as it was a little expensive.  However since then I have tried at least five different over the counter mineral powders and none have come close.  Although expensive, this powder lasts four to five months and covers great.  It can crease/build up over the day if you put too much on and as it is mineral and not absorbed by the skin it can rub off on phone screens and other items that may come in contact with your face.
Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.

7079	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great shampoo.  It has a nice light fragrance and with just a quarter sized squirt, this bottle should last a long, long time.  They sell a conditioner to match but I really don't think it is necessary.  It leaves your hair feeling soft and clean.  There is no heavy residue like you get with some shampoos.
I can see where this cleanser would be excellent for people with oily or break out  prone skin. I have regular to dry skin, and find daily use to be too harsh. As a result, I only use this wash a couple times a week. The drying results is the only real complaint I have about the product.

One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.
9301	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this.  I was surprised at how difficult it was to find a truly matte bronzer.  Most have at least a tiny bit of shimmer which I hate.  They don't look natural or beautiful on light skin.  A lot of makeup artists say that a shimmery bronzer is great on people with deep skin tones.  My skin tone is light-medium.  The Balm seemed like a good one to try based on some YouTube reviews I watched.  I am absolutely pleased with it.  It's 100% matte, has a soft and creamy natural texture.  It is a powder but it really melts into my liquid and cream foundations beautifully.  It has good pigmentation, and a little bit of product goes a long way.  This makes it easier to work with since you don't have to keep layering it.  I find that products that aren't pigmented enough require a lot of layering which makes the product look caked on.  It is VERY easy to blend.  I love the shade most of all. It isn't too warm or cool.  It isn't ashy.  It's the perfect color for warming up your face.  I use it in the hallow of my cheek, my temple, jawline, and hairline.  Will continue to try out more products from The Balm.  I also love the Hot Mama blush!

1706	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful true one coater polish! I purchased this after a review on JessFace90's youtube channel and I love it. It's really nice to use when working with nail vinyls as it is a true one coater.

7558	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great moisturizing cream. It's rich and thick and better yet, it lasts for hours. I can put this on under make-up as well as on my neck and hours later I can still feel the softness on my skin. This is also a great nighttime moisturizer. This is a very versatile cream for day or night use. It works flawlessly under make-up and it works very well in conjunction with the Vichy Neovadiol Magistral Elixir. These two products together are wonderful and are useful in the anti-aging arena.
I tend to not have an opinion on the second part of that as I have stated my opinions before and have gotten in trouble.  Apparently reminding him to wash his face twice-a-day every-day is nagging and not appreciated at the moment he has a problem.

UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  I've been using this mask for about a year, and still continue to love it! I don't use it as often as I'd like to, but it works so well to hydrate and add a glow to your skin.

I am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot! I know everyone's skin is different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. However, this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what. So, it definitely won't hurt to try, and it's a great value as well. I am definitely singing the praises of my new found go-to product for acne and wrinkles!
9109	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I love this brand of polish.  Have been using their products for years and have never been disappointed - until now!  Not only didn't it chip - HALF MY POLISH CAME RIGHT OFF!  the top half of FOUR nails were bare to the nail in less than THREE DAYS!!
My hair is so soft after using this, too.  I do notice less frizz, as well.  Going to have to bite the bullet and buy a full-sized bottle when my sample is out, because this has been working so well for me.

I would buy this product and believe the price is reasonable.  You don't need to use much to get the full benefit of its moisture value.  SPF is an added bonus - always. The sun protection is moderate, however.
It's like a toner for me in that while it seems to clean the skin nicely and leave it (after using it on a cotton pad) feeling refreshed, it does leave that slight feel of "something on the skin" that many toners do. It's not unpleasant, but it's definitely not like the skin would feel after being washed and rinsed.
* This doesn't affect my rating, but it's REALLY hard to get the items out of the packaging--you have to really grip and pull. My husband actually used a metal dental pick to get the last item out, and it bent the pick(!)
1775	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Good
7877	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This stuff is AMAZING. I have thinning spots and this covers and binds to the hair. I used to always have to wear my hair up to cover it but i can wear my hair down now and not have to worry about my patches showing. It stays in place and doesn't wear off throughout the day. No more worries. I've been contemplating buying this stuff for awhile after reading someone's blog about thinning hair. I buy the smallest size of these, use it everyday (a little goes a long way) and it lasts me a month. I just reorder when I get low. So buy size accordingly to how much you need.  Get it you won't be disappointed. Get your confidence back!

I would definitely recommend the product but just to be careful with any skin sensitivities, as with any skincare product.

I was a little concerned about the amount of shaving cream included in the kit, but I shouldnt have been.  A little goes a very long ways.  I probably could have shaved a half-dozen times with the amount of product that I used the first time.  Ive found that the best way is to run the brush over the top of the cream once one way and then the other, and then lather my beard.  The shaving cream combined with the pre-shave oil delivers a very smooth shave, much better than shaving soap or cream alone.

I wouldn't totally dismiss the idea of it, however. I may try it in another color to see if it was just the pale one that made my flaky lips stand out.
Update 5/13/2017: I don't know when Amazon increased their price but they need to reconsider! I had been buying it from Amazon loyally but a $38 increase from the Toppik website price is crazy! Went to the company website and autosubscribed to get the same product for $71/month instead of the $115 Amazon now charges. Very disappointed.
1521	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Was exactly the color I was looking for.  Perfect smooth application.
8676	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Claudalie Cleansing Milk and I was pleased. The odor is pleasant and the texture of the lotion is not greasy at all. This has become my go-to travel makeup remover and cleanser in one.

Though it's only 2 fl. oz., you'll only need a few drops, so it will last longer. My other Super Nail Nail Polish Thinner bottle had 4 oz. though it turned out a total let-down, quality wise, this is the one it does what it claims!!

There is a longer barrel version of this floating out there now for women with really long hair, and I feel like while that might be useful, it might be harder to manhandle as well. This works well for me even when my hair has been exceptionally long. I think that had I known to buy this on Amazon back in college, I could have saved some money. The clamp is really strong, and while the iron comes with a replacement spring, I have not needed to replace mine in almost a decade of ownership with heavy usage.
4806	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a guy, and I love this stuff. Bonus points for being able to use it as a shampoo and body wash. It really makes you feel awake and refreshed when you use it, like a fresh pine forest - but not a gross taxi cab air freshener. After all, this is Philip B; it's legit. Amazon has the best prices too, so no need to keep shopping. Big bottle will last you a while too.
3742	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am quite happy with this sunscreen.  I've been using it both on my face and my body (because face it, who really wants to use two separate products when one will do?) and it has been working great for both.  In the past, I have had allergic reactions to some sunscreens, but I haven't had any trouble with this at all.


It would be nice if there were a fragrance free version.
63	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very bright color. Will be a great color for Easter!
I find the value of this product is simply incredible.  With a badger brush I get fantastic, PERFECT lather and this product last many months before I need to order more. I find using one drop of Shave Secret oil in my mix is preferred but not required to get that perfect shave!
3904	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I never got this product from the shipper (not Amazon).  Amazon did a great job canceling my order and providing me with a refund.  I cannot complain about Amazon's part of the process.
6698	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This curling iron is fantastic! I love it! I have very straight hair and it's very hard to keep curls in it! If you don't really know how to do your hair well, be careful and don't burn it. It gets a lot hotter than a lot of other curling irons so you don't have to put the temperature very high! It lasts really long! Great to use for any special occasion! Hot Tools is the best hair iron company!
409	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nice coverage and color for a very attractive look. The coverage is a bit thick so remember that but it is very attractive.

7800	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful, thick balm cream that provides excellent soothing on shaved skin. It is designed to be used after shaving and its perfect for that. But it can be used in other ways as well. Ive been taping my ankle lately due to a slight sprain and the sports tape  irritated my skin after 8 to 12 hours. So, I applied a little of this balm cream to the area just before putting on the tape and easily went 18 hours without the slightest irritation. Its clearly evident that the soothing ingredients truly work.
Best product I have found for my very difficult skin.  I had all but given up but was impressed with the service and the cleanser and decided to give this a try.  Thank you.
It is priced well and the tube lasts a really long time!




2394	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I remember when Obsession first came out back in 1985.  The commercials were so scandalous for the time, and, as a high schooler, I remember smelling it for the first time shortly after it came out, and thinking that it smelled so "adult."  It's been years and years since I first wore Obsession, and so it was nostalgic to receive a new bottle of it through the Vine program.
5560	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Use this stuff regularly. Covers temporary hair loss from a medical condition.
For the reviewers who complain that it breaks their skin out, you need to realize that clay masks SHOULD pull impurities up, and your skin MAY break out as those impurities are pulled up through your skin.  Spot treat with this mask some more over the pimples, the oatmeal will soothe, the collagen will moisturize, and the clay should help to resolve the breakout providing you're only seeing a few.  If you're getting a horrible reactive breakout all over your face or heaven forbid cystic acne from this mask, then yes, this is not the mask for you.

3404	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great color. My girl friend loves it.
This active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, works for me. It's not the only thing I do to try to fight back against acne that flares up when I'm in humid environments. But it's maybe the most reliable treatment that I found and it's a good part of a more comprehensive treatment plan.

2934	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Our current favorite shave cream for the Saturday morning ritual head shave.  A little goes a long way, and doesn't gunk up the razor quite as badly as some other lube shaves.  Very light jojoba and eucalyptus add a subtle invigoration.  A very close shave with little effort, little mess.  Easy to go back over an area if needs be, just moisten the scalp and the lubrication is still there.
Some others said they thought the price was high. For me, $20 for a good-size bottle, makes it an inexpensive product. When it's my eyes and sensitive facial skin at stake, I'll spend a little money. We're worth it, right ladies?

8703	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Rose Hips Nourishing Oil is a non greasy liquid that absorbs quickly into the skin. It works great on flaky, dry skin. I really like it after a facial. The product is easily and hygienically dispersed from a drip bottle. I think the price is high for the size but that's often the case with beauty products. The other concern I have is the bottle is clear. That's great for seeing how much you have left. But I have read that vitamin C products need to be in a dark bottle to stay fresh. And this product states it is high in Vitamin C. However, I am not an expert on cosmetic packaging, so the way this is formulated it may be fine.
There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

4001	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Perfume is very personal. I prefer scents that are earthy, clean, hints of citrus.  This scent comes out very strong and very rose scented.  I don't like it straight out of the bottle, but I do like it.  My grandmother used rose scented soaps, and this smells like her hands, and I miss her, so I  both love and dislike the initial scent.  The lasting aura is softer, vanilla and rose and ambergris (which reminds me of a Bob's Burgers episode). Perfume is personal, and how a perfume smells on you is personal.  If you enjoy the smell of roses, this might be a real hit with you.  This is not really my scent, but I find myself wearing it regularly because it really does remind me of the soap in my grandmother's home, and I miss her. Scent can take you places, remind you of things, set the tone.  Pick something that is distinctly you.
If only is was 1/2 the weight I would have given 5 stars.  Hopefully it will last as long as my cheapie dryers. It seems every time I splurge on something higher end, it burns out in a couple months- while the cheap $20 dryers last me a year or 2. That's why I went wit this one. It wasn't too expensive, but seemed like a step up. Hopefully it is well made.
I will definitely be using this face wash from now on.

I first tried the Green Apple Blemish peel and was thrilled at how those pesky zits that kept popping up on my chin finally cleared up.  Then I tried the Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer and within days my skin felt and looked more supple.  And now, the Green Apple Peel has given my skin a beautiful glow, even in the sunless mid east winters.
2757	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like this cream quite a bit! I'm in my mid-thirties and am starting to get some fine lines around my eyes, plus I have dry skin for half the year, so a good eye cream is like the holy grail for me. This one manages to be deeply moisturizing without being too heavy, and a little goes a long way. This container is going to last me ages considering how little I need to use to do both eyes (try half a pump).
It is important to know this is a sample size, the same one Vichy gives as a gift with purchase from time to time. There is enough here to decide if you like it or not, maybe a few days worth. I prefer to buy this in the regular size since it lasts longer. This mini is nice for your purse or gym bag.

This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.

4846	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Yes, finally a dry shampoo that works and doesn't leave a residue and is not super-expensive. I would like to thank other amazon reviewers for writing about how to use this product. Do not apply from the bottle directly to your head. Instead pour a bit out and apply with your fingers. It seems too little powder to do anything but it works! Very light scent and does not irritate. Powder is white but I have black hair and no residue. This small size is great for travel. Will repurchase.
7840	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I chose this for my husband who decided the same week to grow his beard back. I've been using it for my legs and underarms and it is fantastic. I have hopelessly sensitive, rash prone skin. I love the rich dense lather and how moisturized my legs feel. There is a vaguely masculine fragrance that does not linger.

5001	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have never used an eyebrow pencil. My eyebrows are naturally pretty well formed on their own.  But I must admit I've been wanting to make them a tad bit more arched and mainly even them out.  I was worried about having that typical "painted on look". Boy, I had nothing to worry about!  I made little marks to mimic my natural hair and I was amazed at how natural my eyebrows looked!  I couldn't even tell looking up close that I had done anything, but it made all the difference in the world.  Really, just adding in 6 more "hairs" and it totally changed the look of my eyebrows, but it still looks COMPLETELY natural.  Really amazing!
796	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I got into the sunscreen game too late, now that I'm only a daily user in my 30s. That was partially because I hated the consistency of it. This stuff is different and I don't mind it being on my skin everyday. Previously I was very aware of the sensation of sunscreen whenever I was wearing it, but this cream is light and seems to layer and absorb well so that I don't notice it. Great anti-aging product.
9332	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is great stuff.  I love it in my hair and the feel is very silky a little goes a long way.
6737	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the best curling iron I have used, ever.  I loved my old curling iron, but this one has a much longer cord and a swivel end so that the cord doesn't tangle/curl up. I keep the setting on low (as everyone mentioned, it's very hot) and have not had any problem with burning my hair.  Great value.
6851	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It is useful as it described.
1802	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	One of my absolute favorites. I only buy Essie and this is definitely in my top 5. I wore this on my nails and toes for my wedding day. Perfect off white color with a hint of shimmer. You won't be disappointed. As always, the quality is outstanding as with every Essie color I own.
Coola Cucumber Sunscreen SPF 30 is a thin white colored cream. It has a moderately strong cucumber scent that dissipates shortly after application. It's a nice change of pace from the tropical fragrances you can encounter with other sunscreens
I like it for spot coverage

7298	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Sometimes when I run out of this I go back to my former default, the Dr Dennis Gross alpha beta peels in packets, because these are very fiddly to get out of the jar.  They're thin, and wet, and they stick together, and without my glasses I find it hard to tell whether I've got one, two, or three stuck together!  Single-use packets would be awesome (but obviously generate more trash).

873	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The spray is refreshing after facial cleansing as a calming toner, but it is also good for travel or anytime exposed to dry air for any length of time, like from a furnace or air conditioner.

I wash my face with Cetaphil then using a clean cotton ball, I then wipe the rest of my face to remove any thing that may be left on and to tone the skin. It feels amazing. I am really stunned at how well this product works and feels so wonderful. It is worth every penny!
I am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot! I know everyone's skin is different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. However, this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what. So, it definitely won't hurt to try, and it's a great value as well. I am definitely singing the praises of my new found go-to product for acne and wrinkles!
Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!
9643	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the Jane Iredale pressed base, warm sienna, yellowish, as I have redness issues. I found it was making me greasy in the "T" zone. So, I bought the Abcense it works ok but it's hard to apply I tried the foundation brush and the flocked sponge that comes with it. it's hard to tell between enough, and too much of it. The biggest draw back is that it attracts and holds every minute fiber/dust/particle that gets near it and sticks to it, this is very annoying.

This is the second purchase as I first bought it from my esthetician for $62 and found it online for $33 which included shipping.

7373	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My feet were beginning to seem a bit neglected and dry with the winter arriving, and so when I got this as a Christmas gift I was eager to try it. It has a minty, herbal scent that I found attractive and fresh. It sunk in very fast, within fifteen minutes my feet were happy and attractive again. This stuff really works very well. I apply heavily, then put on cotton socks to help it sink in.

In the pamphlet it said that Allison Williams (the actress that plays Marnie on HBO's 'Girls') uses this as her shave gel and it changed her life.
There's a nice zing to this scent which has top notes of Brazilian Orange, Mexican Lime, and Fresh Mown Grass.  (I don't smell the grass, but there is definitely a hit of citrus!)  Mid-notes are Rose Otto and Night Blooming Jasmine, which definitely come through in the floral scent.  And the base notes are Heliotrope and Woody Musk.  Personally, I get no musk scent from this perfume at all.
While the price seems very high, I noticed that the tiny sample vial with just 0.125 fl. oz lasted about one week for me, at one application per day. A little goes an extremely long way. While I don't suffer from acne, my skin is rather dry on the cheeks. It was amazing how after only a few applications my cheeks were smooth, supple, the skin just looked a lot more even and healthier than before.

3150	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I do not like this perfume at all. To me, it smells like something an old woman would wear. Doesn't surprise me since there are none of the typical "young" notes in here at all (especially vanilla). Or if there are, I sure as heck can't smell them! All the friends I've asked have agreed with me that this is an old woman-smelling perfume. I sold mine on ebay.

It is marketed as a night cream For Men, and everything about it is designed to appeal to the masculine ego, and convince the dudes that putting on a night cream before sleep won't un-man you. The marketing claims that mens skin is different from womens, and this product is specifically formulated for me.

9263	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the few skin care products I have tried, in my life, that will be a repeat purchase for me.  I usually use Olay's Microdermabrasion kit, but I seem to use it quickly and my skin always takes a couple of days to really shed, so on the third day my skin looks fantastic.  With the Juice Green Apple Peel Sensitive, the results are, in me, seen and felt immediately.  It does tingle a bit but doesn't leave my skin as red as a manual exfoliation. I do use a soft wet washcloth, in the shower, to remove this mask as just water splashed on from the sink takes awhile and I want to make sure I get all of it off of my skin.  I follow with a coat of CeraVe cream and my skin is, once my cream sinks in, immediately smoother and healthier looking.  I'll update this review if longer term usage changes my opinion at all.  So far, so good.

Just looking in the mirror my face looked clean, but apparently that misleading.  Using a cotton pad and this La Roche-Posay product I went over my face again and the cotton pad was anything but clean.  It picked up a lot of makeup that the washcloth had missed.
The aftershave makes you feel nice and smell nice.  My wife loves it after I shave.
4080	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This product works well to remove face make up and eye makeup.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  As far as using it for an everyday makeup remover I usually use my Clarisononic and wouldn't use this product with it.
8714	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	it is much convenient for me to shopping on amazon. It is really good and cheap.
4214	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I'll start by saying that I really like Pca products but this is definitely not one of them. I didn't care much for this toner theres not much I can say except that I prefer the pca nutrient toner it is smaller and a bit pricier but it leaves my face better plus it smells great.
6976	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Compared to the Juice Beauty Nutrient Moisturizer, this is worth the higher price. Both have the same delightfully subtle lemon scent, but this one is much more hydrating.
3349	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	All these years I've been using the store bought nail polish removers.  They don't work all that well.  They dry out my skin.  Their smell is overwhelming.  A friend introduced me to OPI brands and I'm thrilled with this remover as well as the nail lacquers.  This remover is just fantastic because you can wet a cotton ball, hold it on the nail for a few moments, and then wipe the lacquer away very easily.  A little goes a long way.  This does NOT dry out my skin, it has no overwhelming odor, and works beautifully.  I couldn't be more pleased if I'd swallowed a pink feather duster!  One caveat; be sure that after you use the remover, you wash your hands thoroughly before putting on new nail lacquer because you don't want the residue of any remover on your nails when you put new lacquer on.  It will affect the way that the new layers of lacquer adhere.
7300	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I had bought this scent in reed diffusers, and absolutely loved it. So when I saw a room spray - visions of vanilla & bourbon danced in my head. Sadly to say the scent lasts for a whole whopping minute :(

5002	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	It's hard to give an objective review when I've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as I need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.
3686	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This expensive conditioner gives a bad first impression since I couldn't get the pump to pop up. Other reviewers have said the same things, so this was not a fluke with my bottle. The mechanism is cheap. I understand that I can get out my pliers and operate on the thing, but really, that's annoying. I didn't have a pair of pliers in my shower, unfortunately.

Also, with the amount of product you have, depending on how much area you need to cover, I can easily see this one jar lasting me a very long time, even with every day use.
It's a fairly simple scent composition that's hard not to like.
I now use this every day and my feet feel good and look good. The ingredients in this foot cream do a super job of restoring moisure and eliminating cracked skin.

7489	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My hair has the tendency to get a bit clumpy at times and hard to comb, so I decided to give this Silk Infusion from CHI product a try. I followed the directions and only applied a small amount of the product and continued styling. The results were immediate as combing my hair was a much more enjoyable experience without all of the bunching. My hair felt extremely smooth and soft and had a certain shine to it that I haven't experienced using other hair treatment products. Don't let the price detract you from giving this a try. It doesn't take a lot of this product to make your hair softer and smoother so a bottle will last you for quite a long time.
1026	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I got the gift set, not the tote.  I can't tell what is in the tote but I saw two people said something in the tote gave their baby a rash.  We all used all the products in the Newborn Arrival gift set and had no problems whatsoever (my husband and I always test anything we use on our kids ourselves that way we know if it stings the eyes or leaves residue or anything).  All the products worked great and didn't irritate us.  There was a tingle to the body gel in the eyes, so don't use the body gel as shampoo.  I like that this set is an easy all in one solution and great as a baby shower gift. the products do not have perfumes, just clean scents.
2975	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My husband has a thick, tough beard combined with very sensitive skin. He allowed his beard to get pretty long before trying out The Art of Shaving Full Size Kit. He has never used a full kit like this before. The only conditioning he had done previously was to put a warm washcloth on his skin. It was with some anticipation that he used the lavender oil to help condition his skin prior to shaving. It felt very different from anything that he had done before. It smelled good and made his face oily. Then he dipped the brush into the cream and applied it generously all over his face and began to shave with his regular disposable razor. It shaved closer than anything he had experienced before. Not one nick or cut. No razor burn. Putting the aftershave lotion on his face kept his skin from drying out and gave him no discomfort whatsoever. He usually shies away from any lotion or aftershave because it exacerbates his sensitive skin but this went on comfortably and didn't irritate his skin. It was the best shave of his life.
6115	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Because it's called "Cleansing Soap", I thought this stuff was body wash at first. Actually, it's facial cleanser with seaweed extract, which gives it a minty green color. It smells pleasant, however, and the texture feels a little like mayonnaise, though it doesn't leave you feeling greasy or sticky.  A little dab goes a long way and after I rinsed it off, I felt clean and refreshed. I've tried other Mario Badescu products and this did not disappoint.
9459	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	This is not a lip product you can put on so quickly.  Taking time with a tiny lip brush can get it on but you have to take care to do it properly as it stains.  Secondly, it does not last all day.  Although my lips were red for hours, it was not even and it TRANSFERS to cups, glasses and even smeared onto my skin on both sides of my mouth.  I have never seen that.  NOT Good.  Don't bother.
I would recommend this for any time of year. I will probably not buy a regular-sized bottle of this, but I will definitely use up the tiny bottle that I have now and wear it with delight.

7391	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My 60-year old face has been well-maintained, but eventually all of us show some aging.  For me, it's droopy eye lids, crepey neck, and some lines beginning to form from the nose downward.
2020	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love, love, love this color!  Essie is always great!  The bottle was actually a little bigger than I expected.  I got a lot of nail polish for my money.  Will be buying Essie products again and again!
541	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this stuff!  I really does cover imperfections perfectly and it goes on super smoothly.  I don't have any tattoos so I took a black permanent marker  and drew a smiley face with thick lines on the back of my hand.  I used only a little bit of Dermablend and it totally hid it.  You can't see it at all.  And I only used a little bit of the Dermablend so this 1 oz. jar should last a long time.  I supposed it depends on where you use this product if reapplication would be necessary.  If you use it on your hands then you will probably need to re-apply after washing them.  I washed my hands and some of the Dermablend came off, especially after toweling them dry.  But that's the only situation I see that re-application would be necessary during the day.  It's a make-up so it's not permanent and you'd want to wash it off eventually anyway.  It will rub off on your clothing too so think about where you're applying it and what you're wearing.
3875	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this for the past one month and it has really helped my nails. They grow faster and stronger now. I definitely recommend to everyone who use nail polishes frequently. They are also a good base, but are not that good of a top coat and give a matte finish.
I don't normally buy perfume this expensive, but the 3.3 fl oz bottle is a lot bigger than I expected, so for this price, it will last a really long time. It is perfect for the every day usage as well. It will make a wonderful gift for the special lady in your life. It's not "too old" like a lot of perfumes are and yet, it's not too young either. It's a right scent for women of all ages.

My one gripe with most of Billy's products is the packaging. These white bottles are too stiff for a thicker product like this. You really need to work to get this product out of the container and its worse as the container gets more empty. Down near the bottom it is almost impossible to get the rest. I contemplated cutting it in half and just scooping it out, but I shave in the shower and that may present a problem. This could deter me from buying this product in the future.
4814	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The best ever. Took care of the problem completely. Our dandruff was over the top are falling from the top constantly. Now, there is none. Use three times per week.
I am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot! I know everyone's skin is different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. However, this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what. So, it definitely won't hurt to try, and it's a great value as well. I am definitely singing the praises of my new found go-to product for acne and wrinkles!
I would recommend this to anyone who contends with thinning hair.  It is easy to use and it isn't too expensive.

8034	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I think the color did not match my hair correctly.  If I order another one, it will probably be the medium brown instead of the light brown.

571	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a foundation that is full coverage, it has a SPF 30 and it has mineral sunscreen. I don't have scars to cover but occasionally a cold sore pops up. I hate the way they look and Dermablend covers them right up. This makeup lasts all day, it is gentle on the skin, and covers very well. Best of all it doesn't feel heavy. I usually use it as a concealer. A little goes a long way. A great product.
Price is right. If it stays right, let's keep getting this one.
239	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Fun shade and opi is always the best.
2178	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using the proraso line for a while now, they pretty much only make the one cream and a couple others similar to it but yeah, I really like how it makes my face feel after a shave and also how it is so quick to lather up with even a halfway decent brush.
Of all the shave products without a doubt this is the best for me. I've had major neck and face irritation for decades and tried everything and finally this worked. Cools my face and hydrates ... this is the best of the shave products Billy Jealousy makes hands down and I couldn't do without it.
For some reason this stuff went really fast for me. It didn't glide too well on my skin. I may repurchase this in the future, but now I'm still looking for a better product that is more suited for my skin and my budget. I can imagine this cream can work for many other people
The packaging is simple and straightforward - the bottle is squeezable and is similar to an eye drop bottle.  The serum comes out easily,
If you like glitter and you love sparkly you've gotta' try these products!!
For this price, I was hoping that they would at least include the stainless steel razor and stand that the dude on the product pictures uses.  But no, apparently that's a premium.  To me, this is not a "kit", it is some stuff you can put on your face, and a brush to put on your face with.  This is only step one of the shaving process - they don't provide you the tools necessary to complete step 2: SHAVE!! Thus, to me, it should not be labeled a 'kit'.
8963	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	EXCELLENT curling iron.  My hairstylist at Aveda uses this curling iron, and recommended it to achieve loose curls/beach waves.  I have very fine shiny hair which is usually difficult to curl. With a bit of Kenra 25 hairspray my curls last all day! I would recommend this to anyone with healthy hair. (if your hair is brittle be sure to use a heat protectant and turn down the heat setting)
It goes on colorless and does not leave any white or paling residue, nor does it diminish the color/shading of your makeup.
The directions say to apply a thin layer, but go ahead and be liberal with it if you don't mind running out of the product quicker. I feel like it's a better experience when the stuff is really caked on. Look at me, I've got mud on my face! Let it sit for like ten minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. It leaves my skin soft and (hopefully) purified. How my skin feels in winter will be the true test since this summer has been very humid.
7035	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It could feel more like a scrub...i don't know that it removes many dead skin cells because it really lacks a scrubbing feeling but it smells pleasing.
I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.
I would have given this a 5 star review if it were just as good as potent as the conditioner it replaced, the abba Moisture Scentsation, but it is still great.

I enjoy the pump which is opened by a slight turn and appreciate that it is pretty easy to control the amount expelled.  I use just a very little bit on my wet hands, rub it gently, then apply it to my face with a gentle massage.  The scent is rather benign, neither offensive nor enticing.  Once washed off, there is no residual, just as there is no residual cleanser after I rinse my face.  I was particularly concerned that this would dehydrate my skin but I have not found that to be the case.  My face is cleansed and well prepared for a moisturizer.  I feel no burning anywhere on my face when using this cleanser and like it more each day I use it.
Most cover-up attempts only draw more attention to it rather than the hoped for less attention. Thats where a product like Dermablends Smooth Indulgence Redness Green Concealer comes to the rescue.

So let me explain why four starts for the product:  this 1.7 oz of product contains Glycerin 20% (skin protectant) as an active ingredient. Inactive ingredients include:  allantoin, corn starch modified and a wide variety of parabens.  That's right - it is when I see parabens on the ingredients list that I get turned off for a moment. I generally try to avoid parabens in any form whenever possible.

Cons:
9658	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I was a little hesitant to try this because the color seemed bright in the tube.  While I love red lip colors, I don't often have occasion to wear them.  However, I gave it a go and, color-wise, I'm glad I did.  The color of this product is fairly subtle; I had to go over my lips a time or two to get it to show up.  But it's a nice, light red on my lips (I have the Tokyo shade) and is a really good color for the office.  It even matches my favorite red shirt.
I couldn't recommend this toothpaste more. Skip the popular name brands and try this out. Yes, its more expensive, but a tube lasts me quite a long time and IT WORKS! The only downside is it can leave your toothbrush feeling hard after drying. This isn't too big of a deal for me personally, its just an annoying aspect. You also have to rinse with this toothpaste a bit. If you try it youll see why and what I mean. It leaves a milky white look behind even once you spit it out.

I know that some people have a different body chemistry, so I tried just wearing it on my clothes.  It actually was even less appealing that way.  My husband and my daughter didn't like it either.

Very little product is needed (tap that brush!) to get the desired result. If you don't like how it looks, you've used too much....less is more here. This powder doesn't dry my skin, either....it's delightfully invisible but gives a smooth, matte appearance. In a jar this size it will last a long time too since so little is needed. This is a wonderful powder for all skin tones and can even be worn over bare skin to matte the shine of oily skin if you prefer not to wear foundation. It's fragrance free and ideal for sensitive skin. 5 stars, highly recommended!

3085	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This serum is very oily. Too oily for a serum. It's very slick on the skin and goes on more like a layer rather than absorbing right in. It takes quite a while for it to absorb, and actually, I don't feel like it ever fully absorbs no matter how lightly a I apply it. My skin feels oily and slick until I wash it off... such as if I apply it in the morning, it'll stay greasy feeling all the way into the evening/night unless I wash my face sooner than that.
This has no smell to it, and is very soothing to sensitive skin.  It goes on as a milky cream, and you only need a small amount, so this bottle should last a really long time.
I have tried virtually every skin cream ever made and this Night Cream by Baxter is defintely one of the best.

Some people have complained of irritation. I have not experienced any irritation while using this deoderant at all. For me it works perfectly.
The skin on which we applied the foundation was naturally dry, meaning little oil.  We were pleased that the foundation contained sufficient mineral oil, wax, and other substances that the foundation moisturized the skin a little in addition to providing more uniform color and blemish reduction.  Obviously this foundation is not a moisturizer, but it is great that the foundation provides at least some moisture.

After using this religiously morning and night, I can honestly say I'm seeing results.  Not only does the skin under my eyes LOOK better, it FEELS better, firmer, smoother, less crepe like and more like a baby's bottom.  The fine lines look softer already, so I'm excited to see what results continued use will provide me.  There's been no irritation, no eye swelling or puffiness that a lot of creams have given me, and no issues with the cream traveling up into my eyes and ruining a pair of contacts.

However, I did get chips on a couple of fingernails within 24 hours.  I had tried to be careful, and my nails aren't that long, so this was a little disappointing.  I touched up with new polish in the chipped areas and it's hard to tell I did any touch up unless you get really close.  So, I think my manicure will still last for a few days, though I expect to have to do more touch-ups now.

4373	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I highly suggest getting this to use after your lotion and before your moisturizer. I use only 2 pumps for my face and neck. Nonirritating and lightweight but effective.
There are several things I like about this:

The spray is very soothing and refreshing for winter-dried skin. I think it would be even more pleasant in hot weather. It works like a toner before applying moisturizer or you can use it to set make-up.
I use this on my face and haven't had any burning.  It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky and, best of all, there's no white residue!
Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.
5111	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My favorite lotion!
851	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Delightful! This is a gently scented floral body lotion. It absorbs quickly when applied and massaged into the skin. My trouble spots are my lower arms (too much sun exposure) and my legs (which get very dry during winter). I've been a Crabtree & Evelyn buyer for many years and particularly like their hand and body lotions and creams. This moisture rich lotion left my skin soft and supple and smooth looking immediately upon application. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing dry skin relief.


9139	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this for about a year and it is hands down one of the best product to treat adult cystic acne. I never really got pimples in my 20s but as soon as I turned 30, those suckers keep popping up. I'm talking about the stubborn, painful big pimples that take weeks to heal and will leave a very permanent scar when they die. This drying lotion should be used as soon as you feel that painful spot on your face. I use it at night after cleaning my face and sleep with it on. By morning my pimple will be gone or significant decrease in size. For the larger stubborn ones, it will take a couple of days to clear up. But use it as the first sign and you won't be sorry.

5183	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My wife LOVEs this moisturizer!!!!  It is very aqua-ish, in that the formula has a lot of water in it (as opposed to a thicker moisturizer).  For me, this is too liquidy to wear during the day or under makeup, but perfect for night-time moisture.  It sits on the surface of your skin long enough so that the moisturizer can penetrate the skin gradually over time, but not so long that it never fully absorbs.  Your skin will thank you  its fantastic.  Just a caveat that this is a travel size  cute little jar that can go anywhere with you.
1125	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I am still breaking out. I keep using until I run out. Not sure why I even purchased this. Thumbs down PCA

8349	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Exfoliation fixes it all -- it helps my pores appear smaller, it improves skin texture, it keeps my skin clearer and softer...

All this time, I've assumed that "I" was the problem--like maybe I'm blowdrying-challenged or something.  But, no, it now seems that it was more the brush than my own inadequacies.
Sometimes the hot towel interferes and this is the least important of all the shave line if you ask me.
1453	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Item is as described and arrived promptly.

The packaging is such that you press once for a the right amount. The cream does smell a bit powdery, but in such a small amount and not under my nose, it doesn't bother me or my scent-sensitive hubby. In a face cream or cleanser it would bother me, but not with this.
8272	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Hideous.  Butter London is a high quality lacquer but every once in a while the colours are not true.  This is an example of a lacquer gone bad.
6447	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Overall a good product though we found it a little stickier compared to similar products. While it seems to hydrate, my skin does not feel moisturized compared to moisturizing products. It also seems to work as a product booster without creating a shiny skin surface.

I use this every morning. I apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. My face feels much smoother and softer. I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. This product is expensive, but well worth the money. Only a very small amount is needed.

412	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I recently was offered Durablends Cover Creme, Blurring Mousse and Leg and Body Makeup. Being already familiar with the products, I was happy to become acquainted with more. My Durablend story is personal. We have best friends, another couple, that visit us, or we visit them, at least once a year. We go on combined vacations together every three to five years. Wed spent a lot of time together before I learned that my friends face is almost completely covered in hemangiomas. It was a surprise to learn she had to apply makeup to look like shes not wearing makeup. Weve sat together many times since, just chatting while she goes through the process of what she calls putting on my face. Its interesting to watch and Ive asked lots of questions. She applies two liquid foundations and a powder foundation, followed by setting powder. Ive watched at least a dozen times and still find it dramatic. Its not a process that can be rushed if done right, but when it is, it can last an entire day with just a little touchup. I saw it for myself when New York weather caused our flight home to be cancelled. Twenty hours later and way behind schedule, wed collected luggage and were standing at passenger pickup in bright morning sunlight. She whispered and asked me to check if her makeup was still holding up. I was amazed to see no cracking or wear. The foundation was still working. Even the darkest portion of her biggest hemangioma remained completely invisible. She gave me my first Dermablend, a tube of Camo Concealer. Used with the setting powder, it erases the dark circles under my eyes that I get every allergy season. One application in the morning takes me through the entire day without even a touch up. Remembering that, I want to stress the importance of getting the right shade, and that some experimenting is (probably) going to be necessary. I was lucky. She nailed the right shade (light / sesame) for me perfectly the first time (I wouldve picked Natural and been wrong). If you're dealing with a large area, its pretty much a given that youll need more than one product in one shade. While you shouldnt expect to get it right the first time, you just might be able to come close. There are many tools on Dermablends website, plus online tutorials, there and on other sites, that look to be invaluable for making the leap if a push is needed. Dermablend isn't regular makeup. Its confidence in a bottle (or tube, jar, etc). I know the way it feels to use it and not think of the dark circles beneath my eyes when the occasional need arises. For others, that use it everyday just to feel comfortable enough to leave the house, it must feel transformative, as much inside as outside.
First step in this kit is the pre-oil, which works fine though with the lather seems a little unnecessary. However, the biggest problem with the oil step is the oil container itself, the opening is the regular sized opening, meaning when you take the cap off it's open. There is no smaller oil bottle opening to get just the few needed drops out, you have to pour it... which leads to much too much pouring into my palm and then onto my face. Wasteful and messy.

This product comes in a flat glass jar which I prefer far more than a squeeze tube.  I like to be able to actually see the product I am using but that's just me.
My only concern about a three-part system is balancing out the three products so that they last an equal amount of time.  At this point, I fear that I'll run out of herbal mint toner long before I finish with the large face wash pump.  If that happens, of course, I can always reorder, but it makes sense that a three-step process would have components that are equal in size.  A minor complaint, and not really a complaint at all.  Well worth your time.
Be aware that this is now a newer formulation that has a few different ingredients than the previous version.  It still is gentle and works well to protect your color.

It is packaged very well too. The box that it came in is very nice. The bottle is a lovely shade of pink. It definitely looks like it's a "sheer" perfume and honestly, I cannot find anything wrong with this perfume. It is now my favorite in my small collection of fine fragrances.

Claims for the product are that it "effectively tones, exfoliates and promotes cell renewal, improving smoothness and revitalizing the complexion".  Sound great, right?  Actually, what it does is clear off the top layer of dead or dry skin cells, leaving nice smooth skin cells in their place.  Any exfoliator will do this.  But it is extremely effective, much more so than many other scrubs I have used.

It was beyond awful- streaked, looked horrid on and chipped quickly.  I also have All Hail the Queen- a metallic with the shimmer and it goes on brilliantly and wears well.

I've reached a point in my life, after some surgeries, where I've got about 30-40 percent density over the entire top of my head and a little less in the back. I have run out of donor hair and was stuck with either having to wear a hair system or use a masking product. When I first started using this I was prepared to give it a lower rating. It didn't seem to apply evenly and ran very easily with a little sweat or water. After applying it a dozen times it got easier and was more effective so don't necessarily give up after the first couple of tries.
9170	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this drying lotion. I've never tried something like this before other than acne creams. This lotion stops my adult acne in it tracks. As soon as I see a blemish starting I apply the lotion and by morning it's dried out and gone. You have to remember in the morning to wash it off. And I always apply it after my hubby goes to bed cause it's very noticble. Make sure to dip the q tip all the way to the bottom of the bottle before applying.

I'm an African American male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. It makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and I can't where the low to bald styles since I have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. It's so embarrassing that I don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. One day I discovered Toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair I thought what the hell, it's worth a try.
For home use, I like it as well.  It is a lot more convenient to use the pads then to have to use a bottle and cotton balls.  Like one other poster mentioned, it is nice having a toner designed for men that doesn't have a smell that is meant for females.

I can honestly say that after 3 weeks of use, my skin is brighter, has an even tone, and some redness has been diminished. fine lines in the forehead are FAR LESS NOTICABLE, which is most welcome.

A little bit goes along way.  It lathers up good.  I like the fact that it lacks many of the synthetic ingredients. Keeps my hair looking great and clean.
This foundation comes in a flat pan which has a lock cap on it.  Despite the lock cap, it is not as air tight as I would like it to be.  The foundation itself is a cool creamy feeling pan of foundation that has very little odor to it and no added fragrance.  There is good pigmentation.
478	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was pleasantly surprised by the Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation.  It's different from any foundation I've used before in that I need to scoop it out of the tub, warm it in my fingers first, and then apply it.  It takes less than I thought it would, but I've found that if I use a Beauty Blender to smooth out and blend this formula, it's easy to blend.  I don't get a mask-like line at the jawline, but the formula does blend away my freckles and minor to moderate blemishes.  Big, angry zits are going to need a separate concealer, but I'm pretty sure that's the case with that kind of blemish and any kind of foundation.  Some skin problems just have to be the center of attention, haha.

I had assumed it was a moisturizer, but it's not--you apply it after cleansing and before moisturizing. The texture is a runny gel--a bit thicker than water, but not much (e.g., lighter than any lotions). I sometimes have sensitive skin but this didn't bother me at all, and after a few days my forehead lines looked a tiny bit better, though the ones on my cheeks and near my eyes looked about the same.

However, to me, the brows are even more important than  eye-liner, which I gave up years ago. :-) But I insist on that perfect arch on the brow with medium width hairs. I can't stand the look of the very thin-lined brow reminiscent of earlier ages; thin lines tend to age the entire face, IMO. I see a lot of young girls who pluck their brows too thin, instantly aging them and detracting from the eyes. Hmmm...

Of all of the MB products that I have tried this my favorite acne treatment solution--I believe anyone who has acne prone sensitive skin would find it extremely beneficial.  The best way to apply it is to use a clean q-tip and dip it through the clear solution and down into the pink powder at the bottom.  It is the combination of these two ingredients that will help to clear breakouts.  This is a highly recommended product and it definitely is a worthwhile investment and lasts a long time for the price you pay--usually a bottle lasts me at least 6 months!

530	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I'm not sure whether my monitor color is off, but when I requested this it appeared quite a bit lighter than what it actually is. So while I was able to test this out for it's intended use I haven't been able to wear it out of the house because the color is too dark for my skin tone. The texture is thick, but smooth.  It come with a small "spatula" type tool to remove from the jar.  Although it states you can apply without doing so, I really feel like it does need to be warmed/worked up prior to applying which is easy enough done on the back of my hand or palm. The coverage is good and does feel a bit heavy to me, but I don't normally wear a lot of make-up. I fell like this could easily leave someone looking too made up if you're not used to applying a product like this (like me!), but there are so many tutorials and information online to help with that.  Overall I am curious about how this product enough that I want to get some in the correct shade for me and even at the current price it is worth it because a little goes a long way.

I ordered it on-line vs. the dermatologist's office because it was cheaper.  I would recommend.
A little bit goes a long way unlike the cheap thin and runny hand lotions that you can buy. With those you seem to need to squirt it on your hands much more frequently. It's no wonder because many of them have water as a primary ingredient.

About once a week, I leave a bit of the cleanser on my face for 5 minutes to let the enzyme magic do it's thing.  I have no blackheads, not even on my oily t-zone area.  It works really well with the rest of my skin care regiment, and lasts forever!  My first bottle has lasted me 6 months.  Only a little bit is needed, and really, it's not that expensive when you consider how long it lasts, or the great things it does for your skin.
My JB purge was so damaging that my dark marks are still healing and I took a little break in-between the kits by washing with mild facewash and spot treating. Additionally, I developed noticeable blackheads which I'd never really had a problem with before JB.
This bottle will last forever. Use it after washing your face, but before your nighttime moisturizer. That will lock in the Vitamin C goodness and give it a real chance to do some good work on yoiur skin. Don't be surprised if after a few weeks people are complimenting you on your glowy, radiant complexion!
I have tried virtually every skin cream ever made and this Night Cream by Baxter is defintely one of the best.

Living in a hot, humid climate, this product arrived in my mailbox in a very warm state.  As such it was very thin and has remained that way.
The container: it's in a tub. Most people don't enjoy this aspect. I imagine it was chosen because the consistency of the product is so thick that it would be impossible to get all of it out of a tube. This definitely would not work with a pump. Tubs can be unsanitary, if you are not a good hand washer, or if you have long nails or fake nails, then you should use a toothpick, qtip or spatula to remove the product.


5222	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is my first experience with this hairspray, even though it's been around for many years.  I bought it at Ulta for $7.99 during one of their Christmas deals.  I was looking for something with firm hold that I can use when I put my hair in a ponytail and have to deal with all the baby hairs around my hairline.  I wanted something that would keep these flyaways in check but that would not flake or look too shiny.  This product fits the bill really well.  My hair looked exactly the same at the end of the day as it did when I first styled it.  I didn't really try to brush through it but instead just got in the shower and rinsed it out before shampooing, so I can't speak to that feature of this spray.  However, I do like Zero Gravity when I wear my hair down.  It gives me nice flexible hold that's brushable and if you touch my hair you'd never know there was any hairspray in it at all.  It allows natural movement so that my style looks really relaxed and loose and it looks like hair, not like a wig or a helmet, lol!  These two Sebastian products have proved indispensable for me and I'm really glad I took the chance and purchased them.  I have several other favorite flexible hold hairsprays (Got2b Mind Blowing h/s, Carol's Daughter Monoi h/s and Nexxus Comb Thru) and each of them works in a different way.  I would put Zero Gravity in with Nexxus because they both have medium hold.  Got2b and CD are lighter and are great for days when the humidity here in Florida is low.  All in all, these Sebastian products have worked really well for me and I don't regret my purchases.  I haven't had any problems with the nozzles but if I do, be assured I'll promptly return them to the store.  I now have a nice collection of hairsprays that all do a great job.  My bathroom counter is extremely crowded at the moment, lol!  The only two firm hold hairsprays I recommend are Shaper and TIGI Masterpiece, which does add shine.  I save these for days when I need extra strong hold, usually for an updo.  They work no matter what the weather dishes out.  Shaper and Zero Gravity are certainly worth the $7.99 price tag and I'll even consider paying the regular retail price for them if they continue to perform well.  I definitely recommend them both at this point.  They both work great for me but for totally different looks.

BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA OIL FREE MOISTURIZER has no scent and is formulated for men's skin. I don't know if I really believe that there's that much of a difference between guys' and gals' skin (research says that there is and men tend to have thicker, oilier skin than their female counterparts) but this moisturizer works much better than other "oil-free" ones that I've tried.

So much of this is subjective, but when it comes to mens cologne, actually womens cologne, as well, I prefer a fragrance to, as closely as possible, be a natural extension of the person, not something that seems overtly artificial. The person is wearing the cologne rather than the other way around. Granted it is kind of an elusive balance but you know it when the wearer has succeeded or failed.
I like this Micellar water for my face, but it doesn't work well very for removing my Lancme mascara (which is not waterproof). It stings my eyes and gently wiping doesn't get rid of enough of my mascara. I get much better results using Lancme Bifacil eye makeup remover and it has never irritated my eyes. So I use the Vichy Micellar water for my face makeup and the Lancme for my eye makeup. I think the Vichy Micellar water is a good product, but I'm taking one star off because it's not good for removing my mascara. 4 stars.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

This full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage. It gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. It removes well with just soap and water. Truly excellent product.

5151	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like the way this felt on me and I was so excited to get it so I could see if it could give my decolletage a more youthful appearance.  The problem is the fragrance.  I love the smell but it was way to strong for me.  I am sensitive to fragrances so it probably seems worse to me than others.  I just wish in repair creams they didn't feel the need to make them so perfumed.  It's just too close to my nose and I kept feeling allergic.  I finally had to go wash it off.  I won't dock it a lot of stars because that's my personal opinion, but I wanted to let people know there is a strong fragrance in here.  As I said, the smell is wonderful but just irritating to me.  I'm disappointed because I so wanted to use this more than I was able to.  The cream itself is very creamy and it stays on well.

The product - ok, the facewash is good. Doesn't dry out your face the moment you towel it off. Smells kinda lemon-esk to me. Nothing to write home about - functional, more than enough to get you through several dozen washes. The serum - so far I'm not seeing any improvements related to the would-be acne fighter. A little goes a long way. The lotion is mighty sticky, weird, very oil-free - so much so it'll suck the surface of your skin dry. I find my face is oilier in the middle of the day using this regime. If it were really balancing it wouldn't be nearly like the oil slick that it is. I have to constantly blot my acne prone, combination skin with those oil-absorbing sheets. Didn't have to do that as often before.

In case you haven't seen one in a store, the top black part actually pops off which I thought was kind of strange but I don't mind it. Once the top pops off you have a lid to twist to open the bottle. I think its just for design which I like because it makes for clean storage because of the solid rectangular shape.

Great sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.

Chi Silk Infusion does not have a strong odor, but a light fragrance that disappears as your hair dries. All in all, it's a great product that will become a staple for me.

Oh, just did a Google search - this is for MEN!! lol - I got it on the Vine program and didn't realize that since it didn't say "for men" anywhere on it. They do talk about it on a youtube video as being waxy and sticky but not leaving your hair feeling that way, and I have to agree. Guess I'll give this to one of my guy friends. Too funny! I did like the scent which was a faint citrus smell. I still may keep it to style the front of my hair and keep the frizzies down, plus I'm planning on cutting my shoulder length hair off, so...
2645	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It is hard to review a perfume since the scent changes from person to person. I had not tried Toscade before and found it to have a delicate flowery fragrance. Very light tones of amber and mostly a talcum powdery scent. At first spray, it seemed a very strong scent but that faded quickly. I could still smell faint tones on my skin a few hours later but it did not seem to have the lasting scent of some of my other perfumes. Where flowery scents are concerned, I prefer Gardenia or Jasmine tones and this perfume does not have those. So it will not be a favorite for me.

I received the color called Bisque.  I thought it might be too pale for me but it is perfect.  In the pan it looks tan but on my skin it blends in like it was custom blended for me.  This makeup lets your own skin show through, but it enhances it in a way I've never experienced in makeup before. I have pale skin but it is warm without pink tones.  Bisque is perfect.  I am not sure that matching exactly would be difficult with this makeup.  It is sheer and enhances your skin tone rather than covering it up.

512	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This cover creme truly is full coverage.  What I like about these Dermablend products is how creamy they are.  As a result, they are very easy to apply and don't cake up on your face.  I used this and the concealer and I think this actually has better coverage than the concealer.  It leaves a smooth finish on the face.  It's not so easy to tell which color you need, but once you get that figured out you will likely be very happy with this product if you need the full coverage.  It blends very well and caused no irritation on my highly sensitive skin.  Also, it doesn't have any fragrance that will irritate those of you with chemical sensitivities.  This is a good product and recommended for sure.

1533	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Every nail polish I own is by Zoya and I love their products. I've legitimately spent so much money on their brand and, overwhelmingly, their products have been great -- but this is really the worst top coat imaginable. It takes longer to dry than the nail polish underneath it. Hours later, it still gets deep dents. I'm surprised someone said that this will level out streaky polishes underneath it, because for me, it definitely doesn't. The time before this I used it, it also left tiny bubbles on the surface of the nail, between the coloured polish and the top of the base coat. It goes on looking deceptively fine and then just creates nail disasters. For me, it didn't cause polish to shrink away from the tip (which is great) and initially provided a fair amount of sheen, but  I'm looking down at the nails I did yesterday and they're absolutely covered in dents. I used the top coat to help prevent the colour getting nail marks and whatnot while I slept. It honestly looks 100 times worse with the top coat than it does when you just apply nail polish, wait a while, and then go to bed. This top coat's truly terrible. I've been looking for a cruelty free top coat and less hazardous alternative to products with toulene and things like that. This one is just a massive fail, though. I love you, Zoya, but I don't know what you were thinking with this one!

3797	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best skin cleanser I've found.  And I've tried hundreds - from drugstore to high end.  It's gentle, smells good, but dissolves the "issues" I have on my face, which are adult cystic acne and Lichen Planus which is really problematic at times.  It's the only cleanser I will use forever and ever.  Mario Badescu gears their skincare products (or I should say a good portion of them) to people with problematic skin, such as rosacea, cystic acne, and I believe they can add Lichen Planus to the list.  It's helped me so much.  That and the Drying Cream, Silver Powder, Healing and Soothing Mask, and Flower and Tonic Mask.  Best line ever.  AND so inexpensive for what you get.

This foundation also has some sun block capability with SPF 30.  Similar to the moisturizing effects, the ability to block the sun is a plus.  While the sun block capability is far less than the capability of a true sun screen, for short term exposure to the sun SPF 30 should be sufficient.

I've used it for a few days. I wash my face, and then spray a small amount of the La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring water on my face and allow it to dry, then apply my moisturizer and/or SPF.  It doesn't feel greasy but leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. It's a gentle alternative to a toner, but at $18/bottle this is relatively pricey.
6586	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love the smell!

322	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This really does fill in the ridges although I have pretty smooth nails. It is more for my toenails which seem to be less smooth than my fingernails. I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish.
I also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face. As with Dermablend's other cover cremes, the only negative thing about it is that it's only somewhat waterproof, as indicated by the foundation left behind on my towels after washing my hands, and napkins from dabbing my face when sweaty. At least it doesn't all come off the face without a proper washing or makeup remover, however, so it's not completely bad. All in all, I was impressed by this even if it comes off a little too easily.
I love when the man of the house uses this shaving gel. It's fragrance is so fresh and manly; so much so I won't sneak and use it. It foams up nicely and allows a nice, clean shave, leaving smooth skin without irritation and subsequent bumps.
Apply with fingers to dry face & contour eye area using circular motions.  Remove with cotton pad or rinse off with water. (I use a cotton ball)
The fact that it's SPF 50 is a huge bonus.

8051	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My hair dresser told me about Toppik's Hair Building Fibers because one of her clients has had success using it.  Toppik is intended to make your scalp appear as if it has hair in the right places.  This illusion is created by the tiny keratin particles bonding to your own hair.  If your scalp is actually bald and there is no hair that is combed over it, this product isn't going to work for you.  That said, it does wonders for those of us with thinning hair.  Just be sure to get the correct color that matches your own.  For example, the light blonde is strictly for those with very light, platinum blonde hair.  If your hair has the least bit of ash or red tone in it, opt for the medium blonde Toppik.
This full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. It comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage. It gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. It has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. It removes well with just soap and water. Truly excellent product.
I highly recommend this cream to guys of all ages! Although the price might turn some men off you're really getting a lot for your money because you only need to apply a little bit and it is a fairly large sized tube. Most men should definitely add products to their hygiene routine, other than soap and shaving cream, so that they can look their best no matter what age they are and BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA can help with that.
First of all, Toppik won't cover a completely bald head. You have to have some hair already for it to look even slightly natural. I hold the bottle about 2 inches off my head and tap the side of the bottle and move it around to try and apply it evenly. You should use bright lighting when you apply it and use a hand mirror so you can check the top of your head a few times as you're applying it. It makes your hair look very powdery at first so I lightly rub the top of my hair to get some of it to fall down into the scalp. Then, and this is very important, you have to use a good shiny hair spray. I put 2-3 applications on to counteract the dull look from the Toppik powder. The more hair you already have the easier this process is, and the more natural it will look. Don't go swimming with it or stand out in a heavy rain shower for very long, or it will clump and/or run at some point as the hair spray wears off. I would encourage you to do at least 3-4 trial runs before going into public, and order a couple different colors to try. Also, I sometimes use DermMatch (scalp concealer) as a first step to apply a base coat since it is even more water proof and is less expensive. Then the Toppik on top of it provides more texture. I use a lot of Toppik on each application. A medium size bottle of it lasts me about 5-6 weeks applying it almost every day.

While Jouer Hydrating Lipstick wasn't very moisturizing it went on smooth, had a nice finish and didn't feel too dry or too goopy.
4429	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was very pleasantly surprised with the results from this product.  Not only did it clean and tone my skin well, but it also had a more pleasant scent than other cleaners I've tried, and it actually seemed to moisturize my skin!  I didn't even feel the need to put more moisturizer on my face after using the product.  I haven't tried it to remove eye makeup since I don't wear any.

This moisturizer is very different from anything that I have used before. It goes on quite dry and feels more like applying cosmetic foundation to your face. This is not a bad thing, especially if you don't like the shiny, sometimes greasy feeling that you get from some face creams. If you are in a partnership in which you want to moisturize at night, but don't want to go to bed with a film on your face, this is a great choice. If you need something that feels creamy (or you like to slather a lot of product on your face), then this may not be a great option.

Even so lately with the flu epidemic, I wash hands over a dozen times per day which further dries my hands.  This nail and cuticle cream is very nice.  Apply a peanut size amount and rub just right over the top of the nails and massage it for complete absorption.  It works wonders.
After a couple of weeks of use, I really can tell a difference in my hair. Some "thickening" shampoos leave a build-up that makes the hair feel thicker but leaves fine hair looking lank. This product does not have that problem. It's not a miracle-worker, but it's given my hair enough extra body that I've been able to change the way I style it. I can honestly say this is the happiest I've ever been with a hair product that promised body and volume. I'll definitely buy more.
3997	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Before getting this I had used a liquid cleanser that would sometimes get in my eyes and burn. This doesn't irritate at all. I pour a little on a cotton pad, and it does a great job getting off my mascara and the grime that has accumulated on my face. Quite often I'm too tired and lazy to wash my face at night. This product is so easy to use that I am cleansing nightly. It's quite refreshing and has a very mild, pleasant scent.

6818	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like this drying lotion. I've never tried something like this before other than acne creams. This lotion stops my adult acne in it tracks. As soon as I see a blemish starting I apply the lotion and by morning it's dried out and gone. You have to remember in the morning to wash it off. And I always apply it after my hubby goes to bed cause it's very noticble. Make sure to dip the q tip all the way to the bottom of the bottle before applying.
7208	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product! Doesn't make me break out. I even went back to my old foundation to see if it really made a difference and I broke out again.

This nail polish is just plain fun. I love looking at my hands when I have this polish on!

This stuff is great, it is not heavy and sticky like some of the dry shampoos.  It is light and does not creat the pouffy look that some of the spray dry shampoos seem to try and create, it just seems to take away the greasies and leave your hair clean and smelling fresh.  The only problem is the only place I can find it is Sephora.  I wish they carried this product at more beauty supplies stores.

The price was a little steep, but the three week trial kit this came in let me test drive it. I used each product in the trial kit as directed. After the three weeks had passed, my skin was clearing and managing the retinol very well! The brightness, tone and texture of my skin improved daily with very visible results! I decided to invest in all the full size versions of the products in the kit, and though it was pricey, it was completely worthwhile.

It's a nice size. You get a good amount of product. The packaging is nice because it's not bulky, and you can easily toss it in your makeup bag (packaging is important to me!). I wish they sold this without the packaging, and offered refills, so I could put it in my Z-palette. I feel like the packaging is a waste. I just end up tossing it!

Now first, bear in mind, this is a large candle - about 16 oz with around 90 hours of burn time, so you are getting a lot of candle for your money! However what sets this apart, and to me justifies the higher price point is the glorious scent this candle gives off! Within mere minutes of lighting this candle, my living room which is rather large and open plan, smelled amazing! The scent of the unlit candle in the box, translated perfectly to the scent of the lit candle (just as strong and a true scent of daffodils).

I realize you can use micellar water to clean your face and nothing else, I always feel like I am still dirty when I finish with micellar cleansing water.  It is not drying to the skin.  The slight perfume smell is not overpowering, it fades quickly.  This is certainly okay for sensitive skin.  This is great on nights when you are so tired washing your face seems like far too much work.  The only thing I don't like is that always have that dirty feeling afterward, I have tried cotton balls for administering, cotton pads, and a small face washcloth - I just feel grimes yet, but that is not the fault of the product, so I am not knocking off stars for my own tastes and preference.

I was just replacing a previous one that had run out also purchased on amazon. The seal was different than any of the numerous ones I've used. As well the texture and smell was different. Oddly I started developing weird dry patches and itchiness. I didn't put this together until I ran out the other day and I was substituting with my other products. The dryness is going away. I just received another jar from a different vendor that was the normal seal. I contacted amazon at the time about what I noticed and they assured me it had to be right. But well...moral of the story if you are familiar with the product trust your instinct and ask for a replacement.
7742	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is great stuff. I purchased it after I started using the acne starter kit and really like it. It's a serum that is used for problem areas only. The serum is a bit sticky so I use it before I go to bed so that it works during the night. It helps with redness and I noticed that when I feel swelling or inflammation, with a blemish that hasn't reached the surface yet, it reduces the tenderness and redness which I love. When I use it at night it takes the tenderness away and I can see that the blemish doesn't come up. If i have some inflammation in the morning I will apply a small amount on the problem area under my makeup. Like I said it has a bit of a sticky texture but it doesn't get to sticky if you use a small amount under makeup. Overall great product.

Although I've only been using the Toleraine cleanser for a few days, I really like it!
5969	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I loved the color of this nail polish when I first bought it.  However, after applying two coats it was a disastrous mess.  The ending result was thick, streaky and looked as if I applied 5 coats.  When dried it was so unattractive, it had to be removed straight away.  Not worth $14.00!

It smells pretty nice when it burns, not too overwhelming. I did notice a bit of black smoke coming from the wick as it burned, so its a bit of a mood killer there.
5018	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very refreshing and moisturizing.

  Ive been using this product for a couple years now. I still Absolutely love it. Im now a mother of TWINS Which means I do not have the time to do my make up. So i put on my daily moisturizer and than throw this on. Thats it (most days)! It still evens my skin tone out wonderfully. I am so so so happy with this product. I bought my last one in April and it is now Sept and i am here ordering another one. That is a full 5 months using it DAILY!!!
42	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm not one for scents or cologne, normally, however as the Vine Program offered this and it is billed for men or women, my wife and I decided to try it. The fragrance is clean and sophisticated but not overbearing and does indeed suit both men and women. Amazon's price is still a little steep, coming from someone not into frangrances, but there is enough here to last a goodly while.

9725	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am not a big fan of perfumes or body sprays as sometimes, they can be overpowering and I can get nasty headaches from smelling it. My husband is not a fan of fragrances at all, especially anything that has a cinnamon scent to it. This Burberry, which I have never smelled before, is really nice. I like the pleasant scent. It lingers but not too strongly. It definitely has a feminine smell to it ... light, pleasant and floral. (Even better, my husband did not sneeze when I sprayed it on and neither of us got a headache from it.)
I have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.
73	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I recently purchased this polish because I love glitter and I am a nut for blue. Glitter? Blue? How could I go wrong? I certainly did not with this polish. OPI Simmer and Shimmer is beautiful. It applies smoothly, dries fast and feels surprisingly smooth to the touch, even before topcoat. Application of topcoat just enhances the beautiful sparkle and scintillation of this glitter. It is long wearing, for a glitter, too. I wore this for four days with no chipping or tip wear. Love this polish!
9815	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great Product.  I use this as well as the Poraso Liquid after shave cream.  I have very sensitive skin and I do not do well using anything with a heavy scent.  The Poraso products have a light and pleasant scent that disappears within an hour after use.  I also switched to a DE razor.  Since I have started using this product I have had zero irritation after daily shaves.  I couoldn't be happier with the purchase.
9080	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I tried it on the middle setting first after reading all the "my hair melted off" reviews.  Nothing impressive or scary, not even close to hot enough so cranked it up bit by bit to the highest setting.  Yes, the want was hot.  No it did nothing to curl my hair. Mind you, I had just tried the Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron and while it curled (really curled) my hair, the Hot Tools one left a bit of a wave with a smidge of a curl on the end.  Meh.  Returned it.
I've already reviewed the moisturizer on it's own individual page.

6920	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	It's always preferable when trying a new scent to wait approximately 1/2 hour to see how your body reacts.  While I'm certain that this Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum Spray will be fine on some individuals, I found it to be too cloying and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer my signature Mitsouko by Guerlain or the very difficult to find, Kingdom by Alexander McQueen.

It did feel nice going on, and it smelled pleasant. But wear? Didn't do anything good for me.
2516	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Well I passed this on to my wife and she has tried.  I like the smell and, unlike many scents, it does not make me sneeze.  It has a feminine floral scent that lasts a long time.  It is fairly strong - so you don't want to spray too much.  Definitely not a scent for old ladies.
Love this!
2036	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this colour, exactly as described. Wish I could give more stars since this was the fastest, cheapest shipping for any purchase I've made on Amazon, ever. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.



The ingredients list is impressive, and the fragrance is mild and natural. I definitely feel good about using this wash.

620	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this brand and this color most of the time it's awesome. It's silky easy to apply all my makeup is this brand I wouldn't use anything else.
6056	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I love this brand but this product doesnt qork with my skin. So sad. I tried it three times and everytime vroke out really badly after each use. Made my skin soft though.
9723	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a beautiful citrus-y, summery scent; very light and youthful. I really love this. It goes on light and bright, and has good staying power. I think as the afternoon wore on it mellowed into a slightly more mature scent, but nothing heavy or overly sexy. It reminds me of the Colors by Benneton scent, but a little brighter.  The bottle is classy and stable, and my one caveat was that it arrived to me from Amazon with a dented box. It was obviously just tossed in a cardboard box where it had room to slide around and get dented. Since perfume is often given as a gift, I thought I would bring that up, since it doesn't look as great for gift-giving as it would if you bought it from a brick-and-mortar store where it would presumably be more carefully handled. Still, a lovely scent and great product. I would wear this and give it as a gift.
One other things about this product and maybe it's just me, but I also go through this product very quickly, which gets expensive. The Stila convertible color compact is the same price as this product and has the bonus of a mirror. It isn't exactly a stain but is long lasting. I have several convertible colors and can't recommend them enough.
6001	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	One of my recent samples has been Mario Badescu Skin Care Products. I started off with the Almond and Honey Face Scrub which was a pretty gentle scrub. It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I then applied some of the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner) it smelled pretty plain and earthy. The Seaweed scent was just ok, but it left my skin feeling clean and tight. Next I applied a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. It smells like a non-scented lotion. This was just ok. I then massaged the Hyaluronic Moisturizer (SPF 15) into my face and neck which also smells like a non-scented lotion. It went on light, its not really thick, which I liked. Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.
As I use it a bottle like this will likely last me 2 months, maybe more. Given the cost, this is a good value and I will buy this in the future. Lastly, I have used several Baxter of California products and they have always been high quality.

This is the first time using a Juice Beauty product, but the results were noticeably positive.  The GREEN APPLE AGE DEFY MOISTURIZER will definitely be used as part of the daily skin regiment and there is an eagerness to try other Juice Beauty products.
8114	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great shampoo that leaves hair clean and shiny.
For the price, this is a much better value. The other one I use comes in a bag and you have to have your own container and powder puff. I like that this is all together and also cheaper. The other one cost more and you only get  of the amount. I used this for a week to make sure I loved it, I do! I already use the parent company Loreal so I will be buying this one from now on.
After one week of using this product, I noticed my pores were definitely not as noticeable and my acne was greatly improving! I was still thinking there's no way this product is this great! I also noticed that my skin looked brighter and healthier as well.
682	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My lips have needed some extra care lately and I'm not a fan of waxy lip balms, so I gave the Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream a chance to work some magic on my dry lips.
Mario Badescu Moisture Magnet is something that I was very interested to try because I have recommended this line to several people that I know who have extremely sensitive skin with a lot of problems such as eczema, rosacea, and random skin problems that limit them in what they can use on their skin.  They are not willing or able to use diet to control their skin problems (very effective) and they still need to use something.
I still think I prefer lighter coverage for everyday wear, especially since I'm in my 30's and self-conscious about not accentuating fine lines or dryness.  But I really like this for nights out when I tend to wear bolder makeup.  It compliments a bold lip or smokey eye well.
Time will tell, but good as a makeup remover, but I wouldn't use it as my morning cleanse.
1681	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I never liked browns, but I love this color! It's called take it outside! Great for fall, winter and spring. Formula is nice, goes on smooth, shiny, and lasts a long time! The darker color on other fingers is chinchilly by Essie which is nice too.
Though not really an oil (an extract), it did help combat dry skin in the facial area.
4714	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is truly a lip moisturizer that WORKS!  My lips feel like silk when I use Bioelements lip moisturizer.  My only problem with it is with the price of $20 at the time of this review, but I am reviewing the product and not the price.  However, it does work, isn't greasy, sticky or heavy, stays put and lasts.  I recommend it.
Also it's just good to vary products. Weather changes, humidity, age, stress, diet and other factors keep us in our toes so I would say this product is good among others, based on what I need at that time.
9717	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this beautiful scent! It's very light, great for every day wear.  I was a little hesitant to try this since I'd tried Marc Jacobs' Daisy and it really did not blend well with my chemistry and a different reviewer had mentioned that Brit is similar to Daisy. For some reason, Brit really works for me.  I don't wear perfume often and when I do, it varies from Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black to Philosphy's Amazing Grace.  The latter was my go-to ordinary occasion perfume.  However, I will now incorporate Brit into my rotation as it's truly delightful and not remotely overpowering. It also seems to last for at least half a day without a touch up, which I consider a bonus as well.
5487	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the minty flavour. It feels very soothing and I would imagine it has a slight numbing effect in case you get a cut. A half press is enough to cover your whole face. It provides a smooth generous foam that makes your shaver glides with almost no friction at all.

421	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love dermablend products all that I have tried worked great. I just need to find the "right" one for my skin tone. Basically I'm just trying to cover the redness on my face. This product does that well while providing sunscreen which is awesome. I love this stuff because 1.) its a sunscreen, 2.) its in a compact container, 3.) it last me all day. I apply once in the morning to cover my red face, it last me all day. Easy on easy off with soap and water.

I have always heard that with hairdryers, you actually do get what you pay for but I wasn't too concerned with it.  However, since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it didn't last very long, I guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer.  I am wishing now I had just bought a nicer one to begin with as I will be out the same amount of money, having to replace it so soon.

1674	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I Love this polish. Essie has so many Beautiful colors. It is easy to apply and stays on without chipping. Removes easily to try a different color or use the same color.
2547	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Excellent texture, non-greasy, pleasant smell, very soothing and refreshing, but... small size and high cost. I started looking for alternatives and found at a local international (Korean) supermarket a Korean-made 92% Aloe Vera gel in a very large plastic jar. It is sooooothing and smells nicely, although not as nicely and is not as cooling as Jack Black.
155	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a nice color and it wears well.
4721	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This product will mess up your hair as if you've been to the beach, but your hair will smell very strongly perfumed. I don't use it anymore because of overwhelming scent.
The lotion is fantastic. As I've gotten older, my t-zone has gotten worse (more oily) and this does a great job of restoring moisture without being heavy or greasy looking. Super bonus: it is totally unscented. Score.
8937	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I love this spray but i'm not exactly sure what it's for. It smells AMAZING! I have tried to set my makeup with it as it says you can do on the bottle and not sure how well it actually works as a makeup setter. I think it also makes me break out (but most things do). Overall, it smells amazing and is very refreshing

I also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face. The only bad thing about it is that it's only somewhat waterproof, as indicated by the foundation left behind on my towels after washing my hands, and napkins from dabbing my face when sweaty. At least it doesn't all come off the face without a proper washing or makeup remover, however, so it's not completely bad. All in all, I was impressed by this even if it comes off a little too easily.


2961	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The Baxter of California Facial Scrub reminds me of St. Ives Apricot Scrub in color and texture.  It works great on my skin, but I can see it being too rough for some sensitive-skinned people.  The ingredients give it an almond smell, which I enjoy quite a bit.
This is definitely a high quality product that really impressed me! Love it!
4743	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	My experience with Jack Black products over the years has been quite favorable, and that holds true for this shampoo, which I've used before.  The shampoo itself is, for the most part, colorless and its scent both interesting and muted.  Made with "basil & white lupine" (white wolf?), the smell is unique and not objectionable, though I much prefer a shampoo that smells like coconut or mint.

404	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My wife is a die hard makeup fan, she watches YouTube videos daily about makeup and what not, so when I mentioned Dermablend to her, she knew right away what is was, this color was a little off than what was expected, but could be due to our computer monitor. Would be best to get your color in person, and then order from Amazon, as it appears to be cheaper than most local stores. She said it provides great coverage, a little goes a long way, does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great. The product is a little pricey, but will last a long time, overall great Product, 5 Stars

This is going to replace the brand I was using, I love the texture and the feel of it on my skin. It was like I wasn't wear anything. I was really happy that for once I got a sample cosmetic that actually fit my skin tone! HIGH 5!
8539	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I am an African American woman with relaxed hair.
Consistency: dry. Super dry. I've had many samples of this (I picked one free sample up every time I bought the drying lotion which is hg for me) and eventually I bought an actual full size of it which has lasted me years. But even new, they were all extremely thick and dry. I don't have anything to compare them with except maybe clay. It's very hard to spread. But the product is called drying cream, so I'm not going to complain that it's dry. Some people have said this product is creamy, so ymmv but I've never seen it creamy. I've never had a problem with it wiping off while I'm sleeping. Eventually it gets drier and drier in the tub but it still works. If it's solidified, you can try to add a little water to bring it back to life (in your hand not in the jar because, germs). I've had my full size jar for years without it becoming solid but the samples seem to dry up after a few months, especially if you leave them open by accident like I did a few times lol.

I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

9265	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Nice color. Used as a base color with shimmer color on top.
These little jars are cute too.  They are good quality, small enough for a travel bag or desk, and pleasant to hold and use.  There's a bit of scent with the product, but it's very light, and not bad or unpleasant in any way.  After I put it on, I can't smell it.  It's very subtle even in the jar with my nose stuck down to it, but it's not what I'd call unscented either.  It doesn't smell like perfume,it seems like just the natural smell that emollients. have.
I've used this for 3 weeks now and suspect that that's not long enough to notice any lightening of skin hyperpigmentation.  I have one age spot on the side of my nose that I always use as a test when trying out new skin products that claim to even out skin tone and get rid of age or sun spots.  So far that spot of mine is hanging in there, looking like always.  And as for fine lines and wrinkles, again I can't see much of a change.
The texture of this does make a nice platform for foundation and makeup.  It does smooth the skin some (dimethicone to thank for that) and acts as a sort of primer as well as moisturizer, making it appropriate for applying makeup over.
6979	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Silky, smooth...feels light and goes on clear.  There isn't much of a fragrance, maybe slightly citrus.  It's silky and feels like it could be similar to olive oil but NOT greasy.  It soaks in quick and works well before makeup too.  I noticed it felt smooth, but I did not notice any changes in my skin.  I did like the fact that this was organic, it made me feel better about using the product. The serum comes out in measured amounts that is perfect!  Overall, I am really happy with the product.  If I notice a change in the next few weeks I'll update this post!
I also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face.

He finds their products to be the best of the bunch and I was interested to try their shampoo once I saw JB also makes hair care.  The scent is mild and invigorating.  In the colder months I have a drier scalp, and the True Volume Thickening shampoo didn't make it more dry or itchy.  Another side effect of the cold is my hair tends to go flat, so this shampoo was a welcome addition to the routine to add more volume, which it did.

While I would feel comfortable wearing this in any season, Weekend for Women reminds me a bit of spring or summer more than fall or winter; which I associate with musk and sandalwood scents.
Saturate a few cotton rounds and swipe gently over your face. Not hard...the water does the work.
5206	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great moisturizing cream. It's rich and thick and better yet, it lasts for hours. I can put this on under make-up as well as on my neck and hours later I can still feel the softness on my skin. This is also a great nighttime moisturizer. This is a very versatile cream for day or night use. It works flawlessly under make-up and it works very well in conjunction with the Vichy Neovadiol Magistral Elixir. These two products together are wonderful and are useful in the anti-aging arena.
It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.
It comes out as a thick white lotion that I spread over my face.  I received a tester and there were no instructions.  I used it like I would any other mask, applying it to my face and letting it dry before rinsing it well.
8694	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I already have several products that I own from Mario Badescu and I was very happy to add the Rose Hips Nourishing Oil to my collection of beauty products. This doesn't feel like a typical face oil to me.  It is a lot lighter but certainly works just as well as the thicker face oils that I own. I find it does a great job at giving me the moisture back into my skin that is needed.  This will be very helpful for me in the winter months coming up when my skin always seems to be very dry.  After the oil sunk into my skin It didn't feel sticky at all.  Overall, this oil does a great job giving back the moisture your skin needs!

I use this every morning. I apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. My face feels much smoother and softer. I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. This product is expensive, but well worth the money. Only a very small amount is needed.
It does a pretty good job of cleaning makeup off my face. I've only had trace amounts of makeup left after washing. You only need to use a little bit so this bottle is going to last a really long time.
First, Im impressed with the bottle that belies its quite affordable price. The multi-faceted vintage glass look prepared me for quality contents. I used it gingerly on my wrists and  for me  the top note was citrusy with a tart lemony and musky smell upon first application with a hint of bergamot. It settles in with a crisp and refreshing scent.

If my skin is raw from my skin condition (Lichen Planus) I hold off for a day or two because it can burn a little because of the AHA it contains, but when I have more or less "normal" skin, I use it on a cotton ball or two, making sure to get my neck too, and it makes my skin feel so clean and tightens up my pores.  Love this stuff!

3662	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I haven't been pleased with self-tanners in the past and almost didn't order this, but I am glad I did.  The mousse goes on creamy (once you let the application mitt dry) but is almost instantly absorbed.  Best yet I didn't get a streaky line from applying it down the back of my legs and the color was a very natural warm tan.  No obnoxious smells. I don't like to wear hose so this extends the season for me.  It took about an hour to show, so don't get anxious and reapply.  I'm pretty light so the first week I applied a second coat after 3 days, but I only needed to do that one time.  The color lasts a week.  I have tried several products and this is by far the best!
A nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.
It's like a very, very light serum and it covers a large area so you don't need a lot.  Given the price, this is a huge plus!  At first, I thought I felt a little itchy but I decided to not wash it off after 15 seconds, which I usually do the minute I think I might have a reaction.  Instead, I left it on and the "itch" went away almost immediately.  It was most likely my skin reacting POSITIVELY because I had no redness, no reaction.  My skin was probably thirsty for some help.
I recommend this one in particular because of its claim of being oil free. And since I liked the mask that I got from this company a while back,  I now  use a mask on my face periodically, and then apply this product afterword  - and always before moisturizer which I use day and night.  It's a wonderful thing. I recommend this brand and this product. By the way, I use a stronger one that is more emollient to clean off my waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  I don't need facials because the oil free cleanser made by this company eliminates oil buildup which appear as rough skin as on my nose, making my skin clear to be cleaned and good to go.
8096	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My mussy hair needs product. There's no getting around it. My locks are a hairy wicket's nest in the morning, and needs washing, brushing, cursing, threatening, and the right product to look even halfway decent in the morning.
Now for the good stuff.  It isn't quiet, but it's quieter than other blow dryers I've owned.  There isn't anything amazing or magical about it except the design.  It's a bit more compact than my old dryer, and the handle is great.  This dryer is so easy to hold and aim.  All the other blow dryers I've owned felt clunky.  This feels like an extension of my arm.  You know how sometimes you have those days when you go to spray your hair, and you wind up spraying the bathroom door?  It's like that with blow dryers, too, let's face it.  I don't have that problem with this baby.  I actually *don't mind* having to dry my hair!  Since I can really get it pointed in the right direction, I can get my hair dry faster.  I noticed this difference in the grip as soon as I took it out of the box.  Also, my arms don't get as tired with my BaByliss.

Everyone I've told about this stuff has been immediately hooked! Buy it, you will not regret it!
For those of you looking for a more natural skin care line, this is more on the natural side, but it still has dimethicone, mineral oil, and some extracts of things which I don't consider natural, but for shelf life are more in line with long term performance.  The sunscreen in it is not one that I really like but it does the job if that is your primary concern.
3795	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Glycolic but gentle - I use once or twice a week.
4210	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Burns a little when putting it on.  Works well removing dry and dull patches.  Along with the rest of the regimen, leaves skin flwless.
I was actually not as concerned about breakouts as I was that my face was starting to look dull, tired and worn out.  I work a lot, and get little sleep - which is no good.  But once I started catching up on sleep I thought my face still looked dull and colorless.  I tried this cleanser to brighten my face.  I was not disappointed.  I think I'm looking brighter, more my age or perhaps a year or two younger.

Also, I wish the listing would display the shades in ascending (or descending) order of pigment.  I would like to try the shade just one shade darker than this one, but the images (and color names, with are un-numbered) make that difficult to discern.
The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.
3141	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have used this product for years and I have always thought it worked well, i recommend it if you are looking for an antiperspirant and deodorant

2807	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	While this probably deserves a 5 star rating for how cool and sharp they are, I just can't imagine any pair of nail clippers being worth this much money. This is super small and folds completely flat. It also has a small, leather case for storage (a little tight to get into but it will soften). The clippers are super sharp and do a great job. The engineering in the design is really neat and I love how it folds out and becomes a tension spring. Very cool. But really, I'm not sure my nails are worth it.

4251	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The scent of this perfume is light, but a little goes a long way. I'd describe the scent as floral with musky undertones. I did not like the fact that it comes in a spray bottle because to me, spraying perfume always creates too much scent. Instead, I'd recommend spraying it on a tissue and swiping it on your wrists. The bottle, itself, is lovely and made of glass. It looks very high end and would make a beautiful gift!
6419	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have lupus and acne this is really helping with my irritated skin, used it twice and my skin is much less red and softer without feeling greasy.
The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a loop attached to hang it forcing me to have to try to balance it on my sink. Electrical items should NOT be by water. Still, that's where I "do" my hair and it's too hot to put on my lap, wood surface, etc.

4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF):
8238	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Very disappointed. It may be 7-free but it's rated a "6" on EWG. Ugh! I was going to go back to Essie (rated a 5 with EWG Skin Deep) but will try Zoya (5-free) because of all the good things I read about it. It was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed.
-it doesnt flake everywhere like some of the other products do.
I'm afraid by the time I finally "grow out of" my acne it'll be time for wrinkle cream. Anyway, overall the product seems fine - the only item out of the entire kit I'd repurchase at this point - considering I'm still in the dreaded purge - is the facial peel. I love the peel. I could just about eat it out of the jar. Again, I use it as recommended and it seems to help the acne (when applied at night). The morning after when I awake the acne appears diminished. Then a couple days later I have a whole new crop of white and red beauties to remind me this kit isn't working out very well. Be prepared to be snubbed by JB after they've gotten your money because that's how I feel.
4474	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was both pleased and surprised at how well this product worked.  I hate taking eye makeup off, it's always unpleasant so giving this product a go to do it was a nice surprise at how easy and less messy it was.  I used it on taking off all my makeup and it did a great job. It will help to make life a little bit easier. I had no problems with it and am glad to have it to use. I think you will be as well.
Seriously a must for fair skinned people with sensitive skin and dry to normal skin.  Highly recommended!!  Thank you to the seller as my restorative cream came in perfect condition.  Pure white and blended.  Especially for the price this one is a winner and can be used by the whole family.
9286	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am very pale, almost ghostly.  I wanted something to give a little color to my face so when I came across The Balm's Bahama Mama I thought I would give it a try.  When I received the compact the product did appear a little darker than I was expecting.  It will work for pale girls like me but you really need a light hand with this stuff.  A little goes a very long way.  This compact should last me over a year in my estimation.  For those with darker complexions this should be a perfect fit.  The color does blend very well in my opinion so I think most people can make this work for them.

2568	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm in love with this Leonor Greyl Paris Masque for hair. Everything about it screams luxury. The packaging, the container, the luscious fragrance, and even the tool to get it out of the tub. Very well thought out, easy to get the masque out of the tub without getting water into the container. The masque itself goes on thin and I wasn't sure I was rinsing it out well enough after using it but when I styled my hair it looked wonderful. This helped my hair look and feel great all day long (and I was even outside in the wind). This is a great product. A nice way to pamper yourself.

5202	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very, very, very smooth and rich cream.  Feels like a million bucks, with beautiful packaging to match.  It works as a moisturizer, but I can't say that I look a whole lot younger after using it for a few weeks.  Maybe that will kick in after a couple of months - for now my skin feels nice but I still think I'm getting older even though it's supposed to prevent aging.

After burning my lips badly while on vacation, I was on the lookout for a balm with as high an SPF as possible.  This produce has SPF 25, so should help prevent future burns.
1246	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	OK THE REASON I AM GIVING TOPPIK ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I BEEN BUYINGTHIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. IT USE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. NOW, THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. LATELY AFTER U PUT THE MEDIUM BROWN IN UR HAIR AND THEN U PUT THE SPRAY ON TOP OF IT, YOUR HAIR BECOMES PURPLE ON THE AREA WHERE UR HAIR IS THINNING BUT THE REST STAYS BROWN AND IT LOOKS GROSS AND DISGUSTING. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE AND I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND I SENT THEM PICTURES, THEY RESPONDED SAYING THAT THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT MUST BE DMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE.

Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.
This has a very smooth texture/consistency and I don't detect any scent.  (This is not tinted, either.)  I find that it rubs in smoothly to my skin without leaving residue.  I like the combination of octinoxate and zinc oxide, as chemical and mineral sunscreens offer slightly different protection, and this product contains both.  (Plus, octinoxate is one of the safest chemical sunscreen ingredients.)

THE BOTTOM LINE
5810	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best concealer out there.
It provides nice moisture, is not sticky and absorbs quickly with no greasy feel.
Certainly good-enough quality and nice-enough looking to give as a gift, and the packaging is frustration-free.  The products are packed in a clamshell box with a magnetic closure and held shut with a paper sleeve with marketing information.  The box itself is blue, and unmarked.  There isn't any plastic wrap around the box.  Removing the glass bottles from the box is very difficult.  I had to pry them out with a butter knife.  Once out of the box, the products and shaving brush present very well.  The pre-shave oil and after-shave lotion are both packed in high-quality glass bottles, and the shaving brush is a good quality, badger-hair brush with a plastic handle.  The shaving cream is packed in a plastic screw-top tub that is easy to handle.
6983	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The results of use seem to be modest and temporary, but real. The thing we noticed was that while the ingredients may be organic, that doesn't mean they can't be irritating to sensitive skin. For example, soluble aspirin is part of the formula (salicylic acid from willow bark) so if you are sensitive to that, this may not be for you.

7252	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the only make up I will ever use. I learned about it while working at the Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii,  people are always complimenting me on my skin and actually it's the makeup.  I have oily skin and this doesn't come to the surface like other makeup does. It also has an SPF20. I just love it! It is so healthy for you I have taken a class and it is one of the Best mineral makeups you can use.
5392	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very sticky on the face but not drying...great for spot treatments

5802	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love the Korres lip butters and own approximatley 4 different shades. This smells really nice - kind of sugary - and is really moisturizing. It has a slight tint, but looks very natural.

4298	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	For several years now, I've been doing a modified version of the Korean 10-Step skincare routine (at night only).  My two-step cleanse normally consists of an oil or balm to remove my foundation followed by an exfoliating cleanser.  The "official" step two of the double cleanse Is supposed to be a foaming cleanser, but as I've aged I find that soaps and foams leave my skin feeling tight and dry so I avoid them.
Like most Dermablend products, the Cover Cr&egrave;me line is pricey, but it is a very nice cream foundation.  It wears exceptionally well, stays put, and also cleans up pretty easy with water, soap, and wipes.  Even though Dermablend recommends using a setting powder, I find it holds up very well for hours without it.
818	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this stuff!  It's got ceramides so it replenishes the lipid layer, keeping lips & skin soft.  It's perfect for lips, rough/dry eczema patches, and cuticles.  It doesn't have a fragrance, but it smells like shea butter.

9833	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Terrific!  Smells like you just got out of the shower and wrapped yourself in a just-laundered towel. I've never smelled a perfume as crisp and clean smelling. The fragrance doesn't last all day, but what a great way to start the morning.

866	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this since I love other products by this brand.  I didn't realize it was JUST spring water; but it was. I admit I about died laughing when I saw that. However, oddly enough, it does wonders for the skin. It's like a very light moisturizer. It sprays on super fine, very refreshing after my shower, and I let it air dry (why would you pat it off like they suggest?!) I come out with very soft, fresh feeling skin that is lightly moisturized. Now I have very dry skin and usually use Shea butter, but I can get away with using this when I have less time to get ready. I just work on my makeup and teeth brushing and the like while it dries.  So yes, I went from complete skeptic to fan.
9966	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.

7868	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	These just really didn't work for me. I have diffuse thinning--not the worst out there, but quite noticeable. Sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump, so it was really obvious there was something unsavory going on on my scalp. If you sweat a little bit or scratch your head, the fibers will really turn into clumps. I'm glad this works for other people, but I don't really want anyone to be able to tell that I'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder.
This actually whitened, polished, and deep cleaned my teeth all in 2 minutes. My teeth felt so clean, similar to after the dentist, and they were noticeably whiter and glossier. So very impressed and will continue to purchase again.

9100	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This curling iron is fabulous!! I've always bought Conair curling irons over the years and just about every 2 years I end up having to buy a new one for different reasons. Well since I've been using this Hot Tools curling iron, it's the best! It heats up very fast and the heat is evenly distributed through the barrel. PLUS, it came with 2 extra metal pieces for the underside of the barrel that allows the iron to open! And in my experience before, when that piece breaks, you have to buy a whole new curling iron. So that was an added bonus I didn't expect! Overall so far.. A++!!
8212	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This item is a little pricey but well worth it.  I purchased it about 12 months ago, and after using it once a week every week, there is at least half a bottle of product left.  I use with China Glaze, OPI, Orly and Butter London polishes. Every manicure is a success, long lasting and smooth coverage.  Wait about 10 minutes between applications of base coat (Butter London), 2 applications of nail polish, then top coat.  Wonderful results!

With just a few drops of this on a cotton ball and several swipes across my t-zone and cheeks, my face looks refreshed and clean. On the flip side, after a night out it works great as a makeup remover. An all in one product that I and my skin love!

I only need to use a small amount on each nail.
As a nighttime moisturizer, it didn't leave my oily/combination skin as hydrated as I'm used to with my Josie Maran's 100% Pure Argan Oil (which is magic--I'm in my thirties and I have zero wrinkles or crows feet). I did try the Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer overnight and found that it left my skin feeling almost as soft and hydrated as the argan oil, and since it's less expensive than the argan oil--depending on usage--I might try it again when I run out.
Rather like baby bears porridge, chair and bed...it's just right!

My makeup looks so much more fresh, and less "cakey". This powder keeps my makeup looking fresh till afternoon, and then I apply it again to freshen up. I really love it, and will keep using it from now on.
2238	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My dermatologist recommended this product for me and I really like it. She referred to it as an "at home peel" which I think is a good description. You start off slow (2 minutes) and build up to 10 minutes. I have been using Retinol for a number of years and I could only use this for 2 minutes to start. However, my skin looks great! Clear, bright and less wrinkles.
The great feature that I hadn't expected at all was that this body was does the trick on recently-applied antiperspirant.  I'm not sure if anyone else has this issue, but if I apply antiperspirant, then work out, then immediately shower, I end up with little balls of white goop where the antiperspirant was applied (and heaven forbid I try to shave the area!)  This soap actually cuts through the residue without rough scrubbing or exfoliating.  I'd get it again just for that.

Im half white and half black with oily skin (its not sensitive though) and ive always had a hard time finding a product that matches my skin tone and doesnt make me feel greasy. And this product is it. I ordered the medium shade and tried it out. It goes on smoothly and evenly and doesnt feel like im wearing a mask on top of my face like foundation does. My skin feels hydrated i love it. I will be using this instead of foundation from now on.

6917	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have always thought the decanter holding the precious liquid was pretty but I was unprepared how gorgeous and mesmerizing this scent was going to be. From the moment I rubbed the tester from a magazine my nose was in love. Five minutes later I ordered a big bottle off the internet and it arrived a few days ago, and I still cannot part with the scent. I even spray it on to go to bed, the sheer fact how warm and softly scented my sheets are in the morning makes it hard to get up to work. This scent melts into the skin, the musky crme brulee base is topped with juicy crimson watermelon, glowing mandarin, apples, fresh aquatic hyacinth, royal smelling lily and precious woods that give it a soft and spun like quality to the scent. I often find myself inhaling the aroma through the day, catching whiffs of my warm body and they escape up and away.

I just don't like this primer and didn't feel it is worth the investment.  You get so little product for a very high price.  Using it under Vincent Longo Water Canvas Foundation does make it look very nice, however, if you have the money to invest and want to use them together.  There are other options that are more cost effective, however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use.
needed. The wonderful cr&egrave;mes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. It hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, since Amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, I have experimented, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using the various loose powder shades together:

5028	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product! I'm still learning about skin care and wasn't sure what a canvas base was, but the directions were clear. Even without foundation, applying the product gives a smoother, more polished look. As the directions say, you just need a tiny amount ("the size of a pearl") so one tube will go a long way. It's not greasy or oily. I plan to buy one when this review sample runs out, which probably won't happen for a long time.

6444	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a bit pricey for 1 oz of moisturizer and does feel like its making the skin smoother,. It is light, not oily, and felt nicely hydrating under foundation in my drying work environment.  It also was fine to put on my skin at night. It comes out blue, which I wasn't crazy about, but doesn't add any visible tint to the skin. It is smoothing, but you can feel it on your skin if you rub it. Moisturizes nicely overall.
I would say that this is going to be a product that people should figure out for themselves how often to use.  I would reserve use of it for myself for times during seasonal changes when my skin gets very oily.  I would avoid this normally when my skin was dry, because this mask is very drying to me.  I do really appreciate that it is good at decreasing oiliness and cleansing and tightening pores.

I can't imagine using it twice daily unless your skin is extremely oily. If you use the pads that go along with this (and I do) get them from Nordstrom; you can get double the amount for the same price you would pay anywhere else. Otherwise the prices here for Somme products are the best. I've ordered the serum and the cleanser but so far they have not arrived.

It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I then applied some of the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner) it smelled pretty plain and earthy. The Seaweed scent was just ok, but it left my skin feeling clean and tight. Next I applied a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. It smells like a non-scented lotion. This was just ok. I then massaged the Hyaluronic Moisturizer (SPF 15) into my face and neck which also smells like a non-scented lotion. It went on light, its not really thick, which I liked. Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.

7543	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a really nice face cream. It smells mild and pleasant and feels really rich going on, yet it absorbs quickly with no residue. I can put makeup on right after applying on it goes on well. I do feel a slight warming of my skin after using this, so even though it says it is sensitive skin and allergy tested, that is no guarantee that this is going to work for everyone. So far it isn't bad enough for me to discontinue use, and I love the texture my skin has after using it.
I have tried and used many facial cleaners and aging creams from cheaply priced to very expensive, and have to say this is my favorite cleanser. It is on the expensive side, but you really don't need to use very much - just that pea-sized drop.
269	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I got the Little Teasers set and have now used three of the four colors that came in it. "Rising Star" is a thin-applying, coppery orange with glitter so small it appears as shine. The color, like most OPI, goes on easy, but I did decide to use three coats instead of two to get the desired intensity. It is not a pigment intense color. It is, however, quite striking and even though I got a lot of "that's orange, Kat" I also got a lot of "it looks really good" along with it, often from the same people. Men seem to like this color; women are also intrigued. Seeing as how it is autumn right now, this is a good color to wear. It is not too bright or shocking, so it is good to wear with any color; as your fingers turn the shine really kicks in.

It feels just like regular shaving creme on your skin. It softens hair and it softens skin.  The fragrance is pleasing too. Overall a good shaving creme but not so much so that it was a different experience from other cremes.
FWIW I used Proraso pre shave cream, then Proraso shaving soap with Astra SP blades, finished with alum and then aftershave lotion. NO irritation, no bumps, no razor burn, no nicks, no cuts - best shave I ever got! (I can't say that I've perfected the straight edge).
Use a very small amount.  It goes a long way.

2265	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using this toner for over a month and I'm crazy about it! Although this is marketed towards men, I'm a 39 year old woman and it's been wonderful for my very sensitive, slightly oily skin. I use it after I wash my face and it removes all traces of makeup. It doesn't dry my skin out and it has helped to clear up any hormonal breakouts that I get. This toner has a very pleasing herbal mint scent that is unisex. My skin feels refreshed and looks healthy. I couldn't be happier and I recommend this for both males and females.
Bottom line: try these if you're looking for something to help rid you of stubborn adult acne, or if you're simply looking for something to help with anti-aging or to help with wrinkles that have already formed. This product really is great!
Since it contains salicylic acid, it's designed for oily and acne-prone skin.  I don't have acne (just the occasional pimple), but do have that classic oily T-zone, and this seems to help reduce the shine.

9044	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I wanted to try this product first before I wrote a review. I bought the hot tools 1 1/2 & let me say it works wonders! I had bought a $20 bed head curling iron a week before this one and it was terrible! Didn't heat up hot or even curl . This iron heats up hot! I leave it on 280 degrees because I have fine hair and do not want to damage it and it gives a great curl and holds! I recommend this product 100%

8106	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This has a very light, fresh scent that dissipates, and is probably not going to attract bugs like some. It is slippery when put on wet hair but dries to a nice, natural finish. A little dab'll do ya, too, or you will get the greasies. It doesn't stick the hair together; it is more like a volumizing control product. Nice/

6995	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Very nice product, the organic ingredients have a pleasant scent and a very clean, fresh, non-chemical feel.  Easy to use, absorbs quickly, and did not irritate my skin.

I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!
455	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Dermablend is a professional cover creme that works beautifully to obtain flawless skin. Many women have acne, scars or different pigmentation on their face and neck. This creme was designed to cover up those issues, when used as directed. If you are going to use this as a sunscreen, apply 15 minutes prior to sun exposure and reapply every two hours to benefit from the 30spf. If using as a foundation, you only need to apply once and if you also use the setting powder, it will stay put without smudging for 16 hours. The golden brown shade is the second of four dark shades. It can be used as a contour creme also.


I used another shampoo after this, and it left my hair dull and weak. this shampoo is the best!
A part from the labeling I like this product, a bit spendy, but you really do not need to use a whole lot of the product.

9370	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I never thought of using juice as a blemish treatment but Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Serum changed my mind.  I had planned to use this strictly on my face when I got blemishes.  That plan changed when I had breakout blemishes on my upper chest area that showed when wearing a dress or shirt that was open at the neck revealing 'break out'!  I then used Juice Beauty for about ten days and this blemish breakout was gone.  I very much like the dropper that allows dispensing of the product without mess.  I also like the clean light fragrance of the product....nothing perfumey or loud.  Easy to uses with placing on hands and lather up and massage into the area...I would recommend this to women who have routine blemish breakouts especially with hormonal changes.  I do think you will be pleased.  This product came from Amazon.
This will cleanse still but leave the body soft and not greasy. This company is plant based so you have no chemicals and they provide many donations to charities . This company also fair trades which is a plus ! I highly recommend this .

As a retired military spouse, my mother has been buying the 3.3 ounce eau de toilette at the BX (Base Exchange) for around $30, and I understand that was often a good value for this fragrance in that volume.  What a coup it seemed to find it here on Amazon for just over $23.00 and eligible for Prime shipping!  I was able to purchase a bottle as a last minute birthday gift for my mother and have it on her doorstep within 2 business days.
3860	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this thinner!!! This will let me save lots of money!! Before buying this one(totally allured by others positive review of course!), I got another thinner by Super Nail and it ruined lot of my favorite nail polishes(I should have done just one or two, but got too excited; it only worked properly with Pure Ice nail polish...). So I found this one and could not resist all the positive reviews it got.
4973	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My husband has very sensitive skin and mild rosacea, so he's constantly looking for skin care that will work for him. He really likes the face wash because he feels that his skin is thoroughly cleansed without stripping the nautral moisture and leaving his skin feeling dry and tight. On the occasions when he's had a goatee and needed to shave, he said that the cleanser seemed to condition the hair and made it easier to shave. This cleanser is non-scented and lathers nicely. He's also a fan of the moisturizer because it doesn't irritate is sensitive skin and it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. He doesn't use the toner. For some reason it's the one step I just can't get him to do, but I do use it and I love it. I'm 39 years old with very sensitive skin and monthly hormonal breakouts. This toner clears my skin up an removes all traces of makeup leaving my skin feeling refreshed. My skin has not been irritated and I find the herbal mint scent to be subtle and pleasing to both sexes. We highly recommend this skin care set.
If you do feel the need for an awesome setting powder, I would highly recommend this one.  For me, it is just too many steps, and no noticeable benefit past the powder foundation.
4706	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I'm 20 years younger than i am!
Well, after thinking it wasn't working (the blades wouldn't quite touch when I squeezed), I finally figured out that the handle has to be raised and then pulled out and up, to settle in a groove on the lever (this will make more sense when you can play with one yourself).  That allows more leverage, and makes the blades close all the way.  So, if you get one and it doesn't seem to work, play with it a bit longer and you'll figure out the lever trick.

6722	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I initially bought the 2" version, but as soon as I took a look at it I knew it was too big, so I sent it back for the 1 1/2" and the size is perfect for getting nice big, soft mermaid waves.  I love that it gets really hot, really fast.  I've had problems in the past with other curling and flat irons not getting really hot or only for a couple weeks of use, but that's not the case here.  This gets my thick coarse hair smooth and shiny as silk, and never sticks or snags.  I would definitely buy it again.
My one complaint which may be more a lack of make-up skill on my part is that I felt I needed more than a "pearl-sized drop" to get the great results.
1069	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a very nice setting powder. At first I was skeptical, due to the white color. But you brush it on over foundation, let it set for 2 minutes or so then dust off any excess. It gives the makeup a nice finish--no "white look" at all.
8802	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a great serum, it works by itself in the summer or fall to keep skin hydrated and will also work over a moisturizer. I sometimes mix a little foundation in my moisturizer to give it a BB cream type of effect, but then the drier parts of my face start flaking. This hydrating serum is perfect to apply over the moisturizer as it makes the flakiness go away.
7481	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It straightens and protects your hair, and smells amazing. I used to love this product until I realized that it doesn't do anything spectacular aside from that. The problem is there are much better products out there. Moroccanoil and Kerastase are two better brands that come to mind. Still, a good straightening serum.
920	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like this and think it does what it's adverised to do.
4732	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I found this shampoo difficult to lather. I really had to use a lot to get even a small lather. This does not perform consistently for me and the price is too high. I have thick hair anyway, so I did not notice much of a change in the thickness/quality of my hair. I won't be buying this again.
Easy to use -- and 1 bottle lasts a LOOOOONG time (like 6 --8 months)..
4708	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	GREAT for people like me who suffer from Rosacea, it certainly helps calm your face down, along with making it very soft!! Great Product, packaged very well, shipped right on time!!!! Definitely a returning customer!!
Well, this product claims to be a moisture magnet and sunscreen.  It definitely does as promised.  I found that when applying this to the skin, it definitely does moisturize and keep it moisturized throughout the day.  I am testing this in the summer, however, so I will also use this in the dead of winter when skin gets very dry and see how it works.


4896	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have combination/acne prone skin and this covers evenly and naturally. The built in sunscreen is great, but I use one under as well. If you are oily, use Jane Iredale Absence primer under for hours of control. I used without a primer for years, but it looks even better with one. This is NOT the same as the loose minerals, completely different color and finish. The product will not settle into pores and barely transfers once set.
I bought these from Amazon for the two day shipping but I have purchased them from the site and they usually give you free samples when you do that.

9998	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.
I do find the switches to be a little hard to operate with even slightly damp hands, but other than that, I am entirely happy with this purchase.
2270	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm loving this Baxter of California toner that I received from Amazon Vine. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and the results have been positive. It's very easy to apply, dries fairly quickly so you can put on any moisturizer you want before leaving for the day or going to bed, and leaves the skin looking good. It has a pleasant smell - the mint is a nice addition. The 10 fluid ounces you get is actually going to last quite a while. I'm guessing I won't have to buy a bottle of this until maybe 3 or so months from now. So, it seems expensive, but it's pretty low on a cost-per-use. Overall, I'm very pleased with this toner and will be sticking with it.
I love the chrome finish on the razor although cream/soap will leave residue until cleaned with soap/water and soft toothbrush.
5468	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	" wonder how you ever lived without it" you will be wondering a lot, it's big... if you see the picture and think too expensive (ok it is expensive), but it is also perfect and it will last because of the amount you will use, I've had mine for 4 days now and my lips are better i use it along with palmers lip balm ( check it out too) and you can't go wrong. Already ordered a limited edition set in red velvet that comes with the lip slip from Sara happ as well and I know I will be buying this forever. Recommend 100%

1002	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been using a prescription-strength Retin-A cream for about eight years, and generally have pretty good skin.  At the age of 42, though, I've been plagued by acne outbreaks that have been leaving deep red marks on my face that don't easily fade.  After doing some research, I had heard that Glycolic Acid peels can help fade acne scars, so I ordered this one based on the positive reviews -- and it really is fantastic!

1143	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I just finished a whole jar. My acne didn't improve but didn't get worse either. I think to truly test I should've tried their whole set! However, from the cream alone, I like it. Its consistency is between a gel and a cream, more on a heavy side. I have oily skin, this stuff won't help with the oiliness, I always woke up with a shiny face when using this cream, but as I learned not being too obsessed with the oil on my face, I can see that my skin is well hydrated even after a face wash. It did tingle when I applied over my pimples (new or popped) so I guess something was working (or irritating!)
8770	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	The mask feels slightly tacky and I didn't notice any real difference in my skin after. I was scared I would break out but didn't. I wouldn't recommend the mask, although I usually love this brand
My advice is to try much less than you think you need.  Rub the drops in your hands and work it through your wet or damp hair.  So far I haven't made the mistake of applying too much and the tiny amount I've been using works very well to lessen the worst traits of my hair and seems to work well for heat styling or allowing it to dry curly on its own.
8601	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	These wipes are great.  They are soft, gentle and have a very mild baby scent.  After my daughter would finish eating, I would wipe her face with other wipes and her face started drying it so much.  I ended up switching to these wipes and her face no longer is dry and is nice and soft.  They are definitely expensive so I wouldn't really use them as regular wipes past the first couple of weeks of a baby's life.  I used these in between baths when she was really tiny to freshen her up and they worked wonderfully for that purpose too.
5990	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have tried many eye creams. I got a sample of this from Nordstrom and loved it. The price is unbeatable and makes my concealer go on so smoothly. No more $60 plus eye creams this one is perfect and priced right.
3439	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Big apple red is THE BEST real red nail polish I've ever been able to find, Its long lasting and stays on well. OPI is my favorite polish. A lot of the red have too much orange or pink and aren't bright enough this is a classic red perfect for a night out or even everyday use!
What I can say is this is a delicate, not overpowering fragrance with citrus and floral notes.
5272	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I used this cleanser for several years and it did an excellent job of removing dirt and makeup without stripping my skin and making it feel tight. Highly recommend..
2691	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very easy to use, goes on natural with great coverage. Works best if you let it dry or setup for a few minutes before brushing and blending.  Nice job on darkening the hairs there but not for filling in missing brows.
3083	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This does a nice job minimizing lines and wrinkles.  It goes on smoothly.  It dispenses a bit too much in one pump because it is thin so be careful to dispense where it won't drip right off your fingers.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit too oily.  Label states to apply moisturizer right after but you really need to give the serum some time to be absorbed--this is not always convenient for me in the morning. (Not so big a problem at night)
4952	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I bought this in the lavender and lime which has a nice smell. However I'm not too sure if it's me or the spray bottle but I find it difficult to spray in a room without the liquid dripping from the hole and into my hand, fingers and onto the bottle. This has me wondering how much spray is going into the room. Prior to purchasing this I had been using Diptyque room sprays which are more than double the price of these but had a similar experience with some of them as well. This spray has a rather light smell and it needs more spray to scent the rooms it's being used in. I don't mean to be critical of this product and have just ordered another one in a different fragrance. I don't plan on returning this one as 'defective' or 'doesn't work' as I do believe the issue with the spray is probably mine. I would recommend giving this brand of room spray a try - there are many different fragrances to choose from depending on a particular preference. The lavender and lime that I based this review on is for my upstairs where the bedrooms and bathrooms are located and where I prefer a soft fragrance.
It has no smell for which I am glad and stretched to cover the whole area. If this takes care of my problem, I will gladly pay the price for this serum.

5378	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this! I really like that you can put it on your lip/eye area too as it eliminates a couple steps. I use it every morning and sometimes at night (for night I alternate this, the Vitamin C serum, the Glycolic Gel, and the Rosehips Nourishing Oil depending on what kind of skin issues I'm having). It goes on really light and absorbs quickly and leaves me with super smooth glowy skin.

6838	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Excellent moisturize and it helps me a lot.

5369	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This does take away the redness, it actually turned my light skin a ghastly whitish color which you could seen was green if you looked closely. I wear makeup over it so it gets covered up, but I wouldn't use it if I wasn't going to wear makeup on top of it. I'm not sure I'm crazy about it but it definitely does work top conceal red spots.
I would definitely recommend Toppik to anyone.
So why the 4 star review? Probably sounds like I regret buying this $25 jar of creme fraiche...
3998	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Excellent micellar water cleaner. It smells nicely, and it does clean my face well. It does not irritate my skin. Before I used La Roche-Posay micellar water, and did not like it very much because it left my face sticky with residue. Not so much with Vichy - my face feels clean after use, not sticky at all. When I wash my face afterward, there is no residue that needs to be washed off as it was the case with La Roche-Posay water.
4824	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this conditioner. I have been using it for years and it helps my colored hair to fade less quickly. There is a noticeably difference in fade speed when I don't use this conditioner. The smell is amazing and it makes my hair very soft. I will be a loyal customer as long as I keep my hair this color.
shaving my bikini line. I've tried a ton of OTC and prescription products to resolve my ingrown hairs and post-shaving bumps without much success. I tried this product and have been using it for several weeks.
If you look them all up - the majority are man made silicones - a product which in the cosmetic industry is used to fill in wrinkles, retain moisture etc.  Is this 'bad' for you?  You have to decide.  Most are GRAS "generally recognized as safe"  for use in food and cosmetics.  If you use the EWG website, some are use with caution.
Like others, I did have some bubbling the first time I applied. You have to do very thin coats to avoid this.
The scent is pleasant and a little goes long way. It is a good product, I just don't like this burning sensation. Also I've tried other peels that makes skin even smoother and work good on pimples and wrinkles at the same time (white Glamglow mask).
3278	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a good lip balm and it definitely moisturize your lips. You don't have to put much of it on your lips because if you do, it will cause your lips to have a lot of white stuff on them. The lip balm will last you for a while. The Jack Black lip balm is more expensive than most store bought brands but it is very effective and worth the money. I know longer use this lip balm because I now use Karite Lips lip balm with Shea Butter and vanilla. The Jack Black lip balm is definitely worth the try if you are looking to try a new lip balm and women can use it to if they want to.

A nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.

This is an EXCELLENT detangler.  I don't know if I've ever used any product that made it easier to get rid of tangles, actually.  I spray it all over wet hair and then use a detangling brush to work this through my hair.  It's SO easy to do.  (I have waist-length hair and I get a LOT of tangles.)
My sensitive skin tingles a bit after using this, but it's not too bad and the tingling goes away after a few minutes.
8923	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I found this product in the Spa on a recent cruise but decided not to purchase it because I'd never heard of it and it seemed expensive.  I found it on Amazon at a better price and the reviews were good so I thought I'd try it.  I really love it!  It's a light texture but really hydrates my skin like a heavier cream and the results are great!  My skin is less dry (and I live in a climate where's its been below zero for much of the winter) and makeup goes on over it beautifully.  I usually don't like scented products, and this has a light scent that I thought might bother me, but I actually really like the scent.  It's light and dissipates quickly.  If you're considering this product, try it!!
5549	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product. Bought it for my brother and the results were unreal and so natnral looking. I applied it for him. Might be better if you have someone apply it for you so the other person can see any bare spots.
5205	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Im new to Vichy, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Some rich cream moisturizers leave my skin feeling overloaded and prone to breakouts, some dont. Vichy, fortunately, fell into the latter category. Not only does it moisturize without feeling heavy or greasy, but it also lasts. Dry spots around my nose and chin stayed hydrated and happy all day without making a reappearance after just a few hours. I love the mirror lid too. Its handy for when you're applying the product on the go and aren't near a mirror. If they make a lighter version of Aqualia Thermal I'd definitely buy it and reserve the rich version for a night moisturizer before bed.

They have a really small travel-size that I carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!
Though not really an oil (an extract), it did help combat dry skin in the facial area.

While I don't pretend to know what about 1/2 the ingredients are, I am impressed with the other half - things like Aloe, Avocado Oil, Witch Hazel, Calendula Oil (those are not exactly how they are written, but I do recognize those ingredients).

And, what's not to like? The antioxidant mixture is mostly natural ingredients and the serum appears to be quickly absorbed. She's telling me that the the skin of her face feels firmer and, most importantly, there is no discomfort.
5448	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a wonderful, thick balm cream that provides excellent soothing on shaved skin. It is designed to be used after shaving and its perfect for that. But it can be used in other ways as well. Ive been taping my ankle lately due to a slight sprain and the sports tape  irritated my skin after 8 to 12 hours. So, I applied a little of this balm cream to the area just before putting on the tape and easily went 18 hours without the slightest irritation. Its clearly evident that the soothing ingredients truly work.
6386	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I like this face scrub. It smells really good. It's a natural exfoliant so you don't have to worry about any of those weird plastic beads that are in many face washes. I use it in the shower because it is very messy. I can't tell how well it exfoliates, but if I put it on like a mask and leave it on for a few minutes while I'm shaving my legs or something, and then exfoliate my face before washing it off, it makes my skin feel tighter and soft.


And the real benefit?  No more tips shot across the room!  Turns out that was happening because the dull blades of standard clippers pinch the tip off instead of cutting, and that makes them fly off.  With this one, they just fall right off with no force behind them.  It is great, and makes me look forward to the task.
6288	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really like how this white lotions absorbs into the skin.  Just let out a little of this (a dime size is enough)from the plastic squirt bottle and rub into the skin. It it will cover the hands and lower arms. It's lightly scented by the peanut oil, wheat germ oil and honey extract.  The oils dry fast on the skin and leave no greasy residue.  This lotion works very well on very dry skin.  My skin does not react badly to this lotion, but this does not mean that others may not, either.
Overall this is a wonderful thick moisturizer.
Anyway, I did a patch test (which is neither on the box or the jar of product, but only here on the web). No problems, so I went ahead and used the product.

5423	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a huge fan of this facewash.  It's so refreshing and leaves my skin feeling so clean.  I have very oily skin and wear foundation so a lot of products just don't feel like they are getting my face clean to the surface. The menthol in this feels tingly and amazing.  Be sure to keep your eyes shut tightly because the menthol will sting your eyes.
2622	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	There's nothing so deeply personal as one's signature scent.  Your body's chemistry interacts with the scents which are applied to the skin, resulting in a truly unique aromatic experience.  I've sampled perfumes which smell lovely on a sample card, but end up being completely unwearable through the recondite alchemy of personal interaction is enacted.  That being said, I tried this sample bottle of Calvin Klein's Eternity on a whim.  At first whiff, I was put off by the overly chemical composition with a spritz straight out of the bottle. However, once applied to my skin, it lost the overtly chemical smell and assumed a more natural floral scent.  In general, I don't favor perfumes with citrus notes, but this one worked for me. Overall, it's quite pleasant. The reason I've rated this so highly is its longevity.  Too often, one needs to "layer" designer scents with body lotions and then refresh periodically with rollerball applications. I was delighted to find how long this lasted without the need of a refresh.  Four hours later, although the scent was not as strong as when I had first applied it, it was still noticeably present, which is really more than I expect with designer perfumes at this point.  I don't wear a lot of perfume in general, so this size will last me years.  Very pleased with this product!

Marine Creams are all the rage, and this gel-to-cream formulation, helps to moisturize my skin.  Antiaging ingredients help improve the look of my skin while helping to reduce lines. I  never miss a day without a moisturizer and this one is light enough to apply under my makeup or to wear just by itself. This is Top of The Line and Top Quality. This is both light and non-greasy. The Pro-Collagen Marine Cream is formulated with marine algae, padina pavonica, porphyridium, and ginkgo biloba.
6249	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	These wipes are great.  They are soft, gentle and have a very mild baby scent.  After my daughter would finish eating, I would wipe her face with other wipes and her face started drying it so much.  I ended up switching to these wipes and her face no longer is dry and is nice and soft.  They are definitely expensive so I wouldn't really use them as regular wipes past the first couple of weeks of a baby's life.  I used these in between baths when she was really tiny to freshen her up and they worked wonderfully for that purpose too.

Its the real Essie polish. No problems with the delivery and the package was secure. Amazon did it once again.
This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  I have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  This covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000%, and very smart.

I have been using this and just a concealer with setting powder and my skin has never looked better.
4180	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great, non-greasy night moisturizer for me.  It soaks into the skin quickly and leaves it feeling soft as satin.  I love how my skin looks in the morning.

Application method:
4807	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	A very nice facial moisturizer but a little on the heavy side. I should have bought the oil free admittedly, but its still a good moisturizer that lasts all day. Cheap moisturizers usually dry out mid day, this doesn't.

I found the serum refreshing, with a touch of coolness. It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. The serum is dyed blue and has an odd medicinal aroma. I would have preferred it without the color or the fragrance. a clear serum in a blue bottle would have been a healthier combination. The fragrance does not linger but I prefer products that are fragrance free. That being said, this product does work. It would be excellent as a light moisturizer in the summer or as an extra layer of protection when applied under a heavier moisturizer. It is gentle and did not irritate my sensitive skin.

561	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a review of Dermablend full coverage foundation makeup in shade Natural Beige. This foundation is quite creamy and just a little was needed for moderate to full coverage. This foundation is buildable, however, I noticed that on my nose and cheek bone areas, it appeared very splotchy and cakey and I could not correct this (the description claims it is not). I love that the spf is so high (30) to help to reduce sun damage. I took one star off because it claims to be "smudge proof" and "transfer resistant", yet a gentle blow of my nose in a tissue, or a light touch on my face takes this product off (even when using a primer and when set with powder). I added 1 collage picture, untouched, with 2 pictured taken in the same lighting. The first picture is after moisturizing my clean face (zero makeup) and the second picture is after applying the Dermablend foundation (I used a foindation brush). I have to say that for the coverage this foundation offers, it is very light and breathable on your skin. Without too much touching of my face, it did last most of the day. I noticed it wore off of my nose and chin more than anywhere else. I am not sure if this product conceals scars, brusises, birthmarks, burns, etc. as it claims since I don't have those to cover. It did even out my skin tone, reduce redness, and cover up some of my blemishes. Overall pleased with the product but not sure how well it will work for those with more significant skin issues.
9208	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Thanks.....
5668	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Does exactly what it says it will do and doesn't cake on your hair.  And it looks very natural. Buy a shade lighter than your natural color.
The doctor told me this is the only cream that has been FDA approved to lift and improve the skin tone of the aging neck. I don't know whether or not that's true, and I won't take her word for it, or base my review on what she's said.  I can only say that the cream had a very light pleasant scent and felt very nice, absorbing well and quickly. Based on this I would recommend the cream, but based on lifting and firming of the neck, I can't recommend it.  I will continue to look, and would appreciate hearing about anyone else's experiences with products that do work really well on the neck for lifting and tightening the skin.

Update: I was getting ready to purchase a refill for my compact and ended up thinking 35.00 (lowest price on Amazon) was just alittle pricey. The pressed powder seem to not last me very long :( Starting to look around for something else. I ended up buying Milani Multitasking face powder in the color Light Tan and LOVE it. I did half my face with Jane Iredale and the other with Milani. Milani won hands down. Better matte coverage and much better lasting power. Best part was the color was the SAME and I spent a total of 5.00 for two compacts!

A little bit goes a long way. There are cheaper alternatives out there, but the sparkle is not as refined at the Nuxe version. I use it on summer days when I show some skin. The smell bothers me on some days, but on other days it does not.
What's that Maglite tagline?  A work of art that works?  That's what this is!  Attractive enough to be in the museum of modern art, and effective enough to make you round up your collection of older clippers and toss them in the trash.  The price is a lot if you aren't sure it works, but it does.  Really, it is worth twice the cost, and looks the part.
6008	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've recently switched over to Mario Badescu everything for my skin care regime and every single thing works. I've tried forever to get rid of my adult acne so I'm glad I finally found something. I live in the desert so it's difficult to find something that doesn't dry my skin but this surprisingly doesn't dry it out. I use it twice a week and follow with the healing mask to keep my skin from drying too much.
My only quibble, and this may just be my sensitive nose, is that it has an awful lot of smell to it that lasts for a good two hours after application. It's not really a bad or annoying smell, just a lot of it. I'd say a floral, you smelled it before kind of fragrance. But all in all, a decent face cream for those who don't have a particular problem with their skin.
5297	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Essentially a slightly more sparkly loose powder version of Mary LouManizer, this is a champagne sparkly powder.  It's really useful and lovely.
I have never had any training on how to use make-up properly.  I truly love the Internet because you can search anything and find clear instructions and videos.  Even on the Dermablend Website, you will find some useful tips and clear instructions.  You can even go to a department store that sells this brand for some guidance, proper methods of applying, and what color combination is best for your skin.
I personally love the apple like scent, it isn't too scented.  You don't need a lot of this for it to work, the jar will last you a long time.  I love that where you place this on your skin it stays put, it doesn't slide around. I find about 10 to 15 minutes with this on my skin and I have great results.  I like this peel more than some of the ones that I have tried with philosophy.  This is a single step peel so you aren't having to use multiple steps to get the results you want.

6943	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I am not a fan of cilantro in food but I had a coupon for 30% off (local retailer) so I purchased this with the peppermint shampoo and a few other MG products. This is a very nice, light conditioner that actually seems to disappear into the hair before I rinse it out. I really think this has a nice fragrance but it's not really too representative of cilantro. I notice the smell occasionally during the day, have not seen any product buildup and would definitely recommend this to people who like quality product (product w's/junkies). If you don't normally spend money on (non-drugstore) product, I'd say that there are better products out there to try when splurging.

The body lotion goes on nicely and is well-absorbed and doesn't leave skin feeling greasy.

I highly, highly recommend this shave cream to everyone! Just try it, Your skin doesnt feel dried out or itchy after shaving either, which i used to hate shaving because I suffered chronically from that.

It smells super minty and makes your head tingle, love it. The best part is when you dry your hair it falls perfectly with no residue on it. Other conditioners made my hair feel and look weighed down like it was coated too heavily, but not this stuff. It is awesome and worth every penny!
The lasting power is pretty good. I seem to chip my right pointer finger no matter what except for when I had a pro apply this. I'll change this to a five-star review if I can get that finger to last more than 2 days.
On the plus side, this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great.

Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. It's INCREDIBLY shiny- I have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when I do my nails in gel. It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.

This is an extremely spicy and masculine perfume, that has a strong presence and is on the opposite end of the lighter, citrusy, acqua fragrances like Acqua di Gio. At first whiff it can seem overpowering but it becomes subtler after a while. Top notes are black pepper giving it the spice, a middle note of saffron and a base note of sandalwood, it seems linear but it does have longevity. It lasted quite long on me, I applied it to my wrists, and I still got a faint whiff a few hours later.

I tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head. I do this for any new hair product to make sure it won't dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it. That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo. I only used the tiniest amount, and focused it all on my scalp. When I rinse, I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean, so that I don't use too much product on my curls. I could immediately tell my hair was drying out. I didn't like the feeling. I checked in the mirror ad my curls were dry. I immediately co washed with a conditioner.

Steps
The moisturizer: Once again, the product is pretty neutral in its scent, which I found to be good for me. In fact, none of the three products is very perfumey, which is a plus for most men. In any case, the moisturizer is non-greasy or oily. This is nice at first, but I found that it seemed to dry out after application to the point that I felt like I could use more on my skin. So, I put on more and found that this would essentially evaporate or go away completely, too. As a geezer, I think I need to have a bit more residual help. So, I've ended up going back to Cetaphil lotion to put a thin cover over the top of the Baxter moisturizer.
This product looks and feels like water. It goes on as water would. Moisture is a "manicure killer". The sole purpose of this product is to dehydrate the nail bed before you apply any polish. "Chip-Skip" was formulated to combat moisture on your nails so that you have the driest possible surface on which to apply your polish - in theory, making your polish last longer.

The slanted head creates a "guillotine effect" which slices through the hairs; you won't feel a thing, even with significant growth. If you have been using symmetrical DEs, this is an adjustment, but an easy one. It will take some time to get used to the angles and blade exposure, but you will pick it up after a shave or two. Just hold it and angle it like your symmetrical DEs and shave normally. It is not as aggressive as advertised -- just more efficient.  The second DE razor I have bought and my first slant razor.
I noticed in this process of pouring out that the consistency of the butter london is MUCH thicker than OPI and even though the oz in the bottle is less than in the OPI bottle it seemed to take forever to pour out.

I already have think hair but I suspect that this will help maintain that fullness and body.  Can I really evaluate it's true thickening potential, probably not, but it is still a great shampoo.  I'm a hair gel guy and some shampoos have a hard time getting that "feel" out of my hair.  JB has no problem.  I recommend the standard lather, rinse, repeat.

  Overall, I really like the seaweed cleansing soap from Mario Badescu Skincare.  It thoroughly cleans my skin, giving it a healthy glow, without dehydrating it.  I relish the creamy texture, color and scent of the cleanser.  It easily washes off my face.  The bottle is small enough to carry in a backpack, purse, shoulder bag, tote bag, etc.  Therefore, it is conducive for traveling.  After using the product for nearly a week, I haven't experienced any adverse side effects.  I highly recommend this seaweed cleansing soap.  It would make a thoughtful present for someone with a troubled complexion.
8232	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	One coat of this polish covers the nail wonderfully.  I did have some chipping after a couple days but my profession requires tons of hand washing and also glove wearing so I wasn't surprised or disappointed.  The only way I can polish to last for a week is with a shellac type manicure.  Wonderful color and went on nicely.  I paired with Butter base and top coat.
The quality of the soap is good, too.  I feel that it gets me clean without being drying, and that it lathers pretty well for a bar soap.  It also doesn't dissolve/disintegrate too much in water, so it lasts longer than some of the handmade soaps I've tried recently.  I've been going for a few weeks, actually, on a sample-sized bar.

I love the colors, although I did make a couple of mistakes in finding just the right one. The "off" colors I got can still be used in different seasons though.

 I'm absolutely horrible about washing my face before I go to bed, so I'm always looking for products that are quick and easy.  This is one of the better ones I've tried.  It's got the texture of toner, but feels better.  This got off all my make-up, and did not sting my eyes or leave my skin feeling irritated, as most toners do.  And even thought I didn't rinse it off, my skin actually felt clean.
This product may cause stinging when you first begin to use it, especially if you have never used glycolic acid products before. It wasn't that bad for me, and would only sting for a few seconds, so I didn't have any issues continuing to use the 20% strength. However, if you do have really sensitive skin, I suggest that you start with the 10 or 15% strength glycolic acid pads. Glycolix makes those strengths as well. Good luck!

I currently own black/grey, great for that smokey eye look, beautiful for green eyes. Basic brown, a darker brown for more dramatic eyes, black/brown, which was my original review, good for dramatic smokey eyes, Nude, a good color for eyes and lips. On the lips it is a brownish mauve and on the eyes it is a brown with a hint of pink, which looks good with pink, brown, or purple shadows. Lastly, Spice, which I use for a lip liner. It is a lighter brown with a lot of pink undertones. It goes great with lip colors along the lines of Sarah and Sandra as well as the lip sugar and butter duo. I am blonde, blue/green eyes (they change), and light to medium skin with olive undertones. I hope this thorough review helps!

Just whips up in its own little container. .

Shaving Cream: I would be lying if I said this wasn't the best shaving cream I've ever used. It has the absolute perfect amount of consistency to help glide your razor and feels so fresh on the skin. I would like to buy a gallon jug of the stuff.
NUXE is a reputable French company which has been producing "cosmetics of natural origin" for some time.  Their Anti-Fatigue Moisturizing Eye Cream is used by my wife and she loves it.  The cream makes the skin under and around her eyes taut and thus reduces wrinkles while moisturizing.  The container is small at .05 ounces but only a small pea sized amount is needed per application.  The scent is pleasant like that of faint almonds and the creme is absorbed rapidly in the skin.  My wife swears that any former dark  circles under her eyes are now gone.  Great product at five stars.

My skin feels tighter in this month, but the lines and wrinkles are still here. I know Elemis products get rid of FINE lines and wrinkles, but do nothing for the deeper ones. I have yet to find any products that can get rid of deep wrinkles, so I'm even happy to see the fine ones less noticeable. It's even nice to have smoother, tighter skin in 3 weeks, wrinkles and all.
5424	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It definitely works; the results for light acne are dramatic within about 10 days. It heals and dries up mild acne on a teen skin. It does not irritate or dry up skin at all. We had a reaction to the last versions of Proactiv so this gentle formula was a welcome relief. We do not use it constantly, just to deal with a small outbreak, then back to our regular routine. We use this one as needed.
Toppik has completely changed my life. It's not perfect but look at it like makeup. It covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. I have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that I started using it and asked if they saw any difference. They said "That stuff is F--- AMAZING!" If you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.

It's liquidy consistency may be a plus or minus depending on you: it certainly makes it easier to spread over a larger area. Haven't noticed any irritation, which is a plus, despite its (natural) acid ingredients. No complaints about smell, either. But, more encouragingly, it seems to be lessening my forehead lines, albeit more slowly than I'd like :)
Bonus:  Strawberry blondes will be able to use this pencil as it has a very slight reddish tint.
8233	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This polish is a bright true orange with the perfect balance of red and yellow.  It is a classic summer shade and looks very nice either for a manicure or pedicure.  The first coat went on rather streaky and the second was a little less so, but still not perfect.  So I ended up having to do three coats (in addition to a base coat).  I did use a quick dry top coat but it still took a full 30 minutes before I felt free to resume normal movement, lol!  This brand of polish wears pretty well.  It's been 5 days since my manicure and I only have some minimal wear on the tips, but no chips.  I was lucky enough to purchase this color at TJ Maxx for $5, a true bargain.  I have other Butter London polishes I have paid full price for, so I was happy to find it so cheaply.  I know that this formula is free of a number of traditional nail polish chemicals, and that's fine, as long as it doesn't effect the hardiness of the polish in general.  I have no issues with the health of my nails, and I wear them short and neat, so I'm not too terribly concerned about it. I have an extensive nail polish collection but didn't have a bright true orange so I'm glad I was able to pick this one up.  It looks great with summer clothing.  I'm giving this polish four stars because the first two coats were so streaky.  But by the third coat, the look was smooth and shiny and in general, the polish has worn well.  I definitely recommend this color and Butter London in general.  However, if you're not concerned about the chemical factor, Essie polish wears just as well for half the price.

9281	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This product line was recommended to me via a medi-spa when I had an IPL facial. As a 38 year old female with combination acne prone sensitive skin, I was scared to try a product I thought might either make me break out or react negatively. I had tried other products in the past from the drug store (Neutrogena) or beauty counter (Clinique), or online (Paula Begoun) all with mixed mediocre results.

That said, I tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer. But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this. I also don't want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color.
5221	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great firm hold hairspray.  I use it when I do an updo and I want no movement whatsoever.  The hold is very strong and it works no matter what the Florida weather dishes out, it even works when the humidity climbs.  This is my first can of Shaper and I bought it at Ulta duing a sale for $7.99.  I figured I had nothing to lose because the price was so low but I was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well.  Yes, it smells like a typical hairspray, but I'm not sensitive to it so it doesn't bother me.  But the fragrance dissipates quickly in any case.  This hairspray holds all day and into the next without leaving nasty white flakes, even if I use it several days in a row.  If you want a hairspray that won't allow your hair to move, then this is the right formula for you.  However, when I wear my hair down I want natural looking hold that allows movement, so I use Zero Gravity instead.  It's a flexible hold formula that has touchable, brushable hold.  When I wear my hair down I want it to look as natural as possible and Shaper is too strong for that purpose.  However, Zero Gravity is the perfect formula for this and now I have both formulas always on hand.  Sebastian definitely makes good hairsprays.  These two formulas are all I need.  I definitely recommend Shaper and Zero Gravity for all hair types.  Shaper is strong and Zero Gravity is light.  A perfect duo.
Regarding the Marine Creme, I haven't found it to be of any use. Elemis boasts this as their most popular product but I can't understand why as I see no real benefit. In fact, my complexion was more congested after using this. Considering the massive price-tag, this earns it a very low rating.

9960	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a "croap" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the "Marco method" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most "feminine" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.

7500	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Wonderful product.  I use this product daily!
Recommended.
2366	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I received a sample of this fragrance from Sephora and I absolutely love it. It's a soft scent with lavender and vanilla undertones. I'm not usually one for traditional "pretty" fragrances, but the licorice undertones give this perfume a little kick. The result is something a bit mysterious, unique, and special. I think I will buy a full-sized bottle of this.
3185	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product! It removes frizz and makes the hair seem straighter!
473	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is not the coverage of the old Dermablend cover up. This is very similar in texture to Pan-stick if you remember that. Strong coverage with some "slide". As in, I couldn't have worn this often in my younger years because it feels quite like it would have aggravated my skin.  Still, it covers my skin irregularities but I don't have anything like a birth mark and not sure it would cover something like that. I'd try it in person first.
1417	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A little something different for the mundane daily ritual.  The taste and the scent is truly Jasmin, but if you thought your toothpaste smelling/tasting like jasmine is a bit strange, no need to be concerned.  The taste/scent is not overpowering and is quite nice and does jazz up the boring task of brushing one's teeth.  The package is nice in that it is easy to squeeze out the toothpaste - I have used Tom's of Maine in the past and trying to get the toothpaste out, especially towards the end, was rather difficult.  The marine mint flavor is really nice as well.

6289	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a modest portion of body lotion which touts a variety of beneficial natural ingredients. I'm rating it based on usability and effectiveness as well as consider value. First, I will address effectiveness and say that I found this to be a better than average cream for dry, scaly skin (especially hands). It softened well and made my hands feel smooth for a longer period of time than other consumer-grade lotions like Lubriderm. It didn't function as well as some prescription lotions, but it is more accessible.
9540	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Love this cleanser. Bought in trial kit first so that I wouldn't spend too much and not like it. It smells kind of weird but I guess that is because it is natural.  Bottles lasts a long time and price is really good compared to similar products
3. Jack Black facial moisturizer- I do like this product a lot
It also felt tacky on my skin. This effect did not go away, so my skin didn't feel smooth and moisturized.

I have this right next to the bathroom sink for use after washing hands.  Great as my hands get so dry in the winter and this lotion has really helped.  Definitely give this product a try.

I like the packaging in a tube because it makes it easy to travel/carry in your purse or briefcase.  And you can squish it down as you use it up.

- a pea-sized amount is enough for your entire face
The best mask ever I use it for years and I'm still very happy with the results .
5195	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Below average moisturizer! How can they get away with false advertising? If I could get my money back I would!
743	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this foundation! You can barely tell your wearing makeup and it's easily builds for light to full coverage! And it's last all day!
420	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I occasionally use theater makeup in order to get the coverage I need.
6100	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using Mario Badescu products for quite a while and the Seaweed Cleansing Soap is one of my favorites.  It is gentle on my face and has a subtle scent which I enjoy.  My skin, which gets quite dry in the sub-arctic environment where I reside, seems to get its moisture replenished with this lotion.  It cleans my face very well and even gets my makeup off - I wear blush and eyebrow liner.  It lasts a long time as a little goes a long way.  I recommend this product.
9870	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The 39C razor has become an important part of my shaving repertoire. My sense is that it is at its best doing what I term as "maintenance shaves". That is, one or two passes in order to get to an acceptable level of closeness. On very thorough shaves, it can become a bit aggressive. Every time I've done a third facial pass, I have found that I regretted it afterward. Not because I have actually cut myself, but because I have felt that I've put more wear and tear on my face than was warranted.
As for how it works - I have pretty dry skin.  It  absorbs anything with moisture then wants more more more.  This kind of just sat on top for awhile before finally get all sucked up.  It doesn't take very much - the old a little goes a long way.  My skin does feel fairly decent after using it but I'm not sure it's any better than the cheaper alternatives I have available to me.  I'll use up what I have but probably wouldn't buy it again - only because I'm a cheapskate and the cheaper stuff doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.  If I didn't have alternatives that already worked for me, I'd probably go ahead and use this - very sparingly - I said I'm a cheapskate.
You'll see from the product photo that the product is two-tone (blue at the top and lighter below). This is not color on the bottle -- there are two parts to the product that don't naturally mix, so you have to shake the bottle each time you use it. I dab a little on a cotton ball, wipe one eye area turn the cotton ball to the clean side, and wipe the other eye. Some say they have to use a lot of product to get their makeup off. Not me. I get enough on the cotton ball to make it uniformly damp, and that is all I need.
It does not hold up.
4071	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This product is easy to use and has a great scent too. My daughter and I have tried it and like how it cleans our skin. It washes off without leaving a noticeable residue or oily shine.

7335	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	The Baxter of California Skin 1, 2, 3 kit is a nice introduction to the Baxter line. It is best for normal to oily skin. The cleanser is unscented and rinses off well, not leaving any residue or super tight feeling.
9345	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is perfect for one's hair, smells great and two or three drops is all it takes.  The sales success of this Moroccan Oil for hair (made in Israel) is well justified.  Our whole household uses it and it lasts because you don't use much per application.

1446	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This works really well, but leaves a slight residue for a while.
6054	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Fresh, clean and a great way to top off a good cleansing regime.  Perfect end of day cleansing when parternered with Seaweed Cleasning "soap".
3646	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this now for a month,  I apply every five days and my legs look nice and tan which is impressive.  I have pretty white legs as well.  I was sent a mitt to use as well, I think that really helps in application. I also exfoliate between applying  in the shower and that helps ensure the tan is even.  I haven't used on my arms yet as I am pretty sloppy with application and afraid I will have white inner elbows but saving the rest for the spring.  A really nice self tanning product!
I'll continue to use this product throughout the winter months.


I've been using 2" metal-barreled Goody and Conair brushes for I don't know how long and I'd *thought* that my latest one was particularly nice with its squeezy gel handle.  But after reading some of the reviews of this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bio-Ionic-Blue-Wave-Nano-Ionic-Conditioning-Brush/dp/B001RUYKVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bio Ionic Blue Wave Nano Ionic Conditioning Brush</a>, I decided to order it and give it a try as a change.
I'll consider editing my review at the end of next month - I'll be officially through two whole months & we'll see where my face is then.
Very different and a highly appealing scent.  Big 5 stars for this product.
This is a light weight, almost watery serum.
So when they say no chips - they mean it - because the polish doesn't have a chance to chip!!  It just peels right off!
6831	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	BEST spot treatment, ever!! It does have a strong scent but it fades after a few minutes. My blemishes are normally about 50% smaller by morning.
7367	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A bit pricey but when I put this on my ancient feet, they feel young again.  Daily applications keep me sandal-ready so I don't have to hide my elderly toes and heels in socks and shoes.  Very good stuff.
6515	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this! Keeps my skin clear and moist!
I like the consistency of this face wash vs the bar none face wash. This is thicker and seems to suds up better. This does not leave my face dry but neither did the bar none face wash. This has a nice smell to it and washes off cleanly. I feel like I get more uses out of a bottle vs the thinner bar none face wash.
I did not need heavy coverage and the powder felt pretty weightless. There was no caking throughout the day either - which is a problem I tend to have. I did not have any breakouts or changed with my skin/oil production when using this powder and with minimal effort at the end of the day everything came off easily.
Fine lines- the acidic skin peel effect is very mild, and there hasn't been enough time to really tell if it's helping the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. The appearance of them is minimized though after application.
1773	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I love Essie, best nail polish that goes on thick and with out streaks. Didn't like the color on me, so I gave it to me niece.
714	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Works really well to hold fibers in place and is not nearly as sticky as hair spray.
1581	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	See the pictures of how yellow my nails still look? I used this product AND the pink perfector!! The tips of my nails are still yellow! I was pretty excited about this product because since I am a nail polish addict, I was hoping this item would get rid of discoloration but it didn't. Oh and I also used the satin seal on top. I see no change in my nails and will never purchase any of the Zoya Naked Nail line again!

I'm not sure how great a product it is, in and of itself, but in concert with the other Somme products it makes my skin look great.
2820	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for something to replace my old antiperspirant when I came across the MenScience brand - strangely I had never seen or heard of it but it seemed to get great reviews. The short version is that this will be my new brand. It is about 4x the cost of my old deoderant/antiperspirant but to me its woth the cost and works well. It does not have a smell as labeled, or at least not that I can smell. I've been using it over a month now and I will continue to from now on.
4813	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I originally bought this about 20 yrs ago from QVC (after an article appeared in a magazine and it completely sold out at Nordstrom's). I remember paying about $25-30 for it, back then. I almost bought it from HSN (for about $30) recently, but found it here and I was soooo happy!!!! I love the natural, floral, botanical scent. I usually put it on, comb through, blow dry to get it penetrated and leave it on all nite. Then in the morning add a tiny bit of water and a handful of shampoo and "dry shampoo" it out, it usually takes a second shampooing after rinsing out the first. My hair ends up looking and feeling very soft, healthy, yet not limp, stray gray hairs somehow seem to blend in and it looks like I just had a haircut. I really love this product, am very happy to find it again and at such a great price, too.
3609	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I know that most people must think they know what cystic acne is, but they really don't. I don't blame people, before when I got a larger "normal" zit, I thought it was a cyst, that is until I developed REAL cystic acne in my 20's. I have had the pimples that people are describing in their reviews and let me tell you, if you have ever had TRUE cystic acne this product will do nothing for you. For sufferers of real cystic acne you know what I am talking about--REAL cystic acne are nodules; hard, huge, sore lumps (not just big zits)that take months to go away. These nodules are so large and painful it's hard to move your face and are generally pea size or larger (I get ones that are larger than a lima bean). The cysts I get are so large and inflamed that I need to get cortisone injections just to bring the swelling down and relieve pain. A dermatologist will tell you there is nothing you can do topically for a real cyst, they need to be injected to bring down the swelling and from experience I can tell you this is true. I tried this as a last resort before Accutane, but I can tell you if you really truly suffer from cystic acne, this will do nothing for your nodules; large "normal" zits maybe, but not true cystic nodules.
6750	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This flat iron is GREAT! I have bought it with a set of a mini flat iron and a comb and I have had it for over 2 years now. I have thick, coarse and dry hair and I am very cautious of styling and heating products I use on my hair since they get damaged VERY quick. After reading numerous reviews here on Amazon I decided to purchase this flat iron and I Love it!!! It does not burn my hair, leaves it silky and smooth!! Of course I still recommend to use a heat protecting spray beforehand but seriously I have never experienced a flat iron this good! I am able to straighten my long, big and thick hair a bit under 40 minutes and it stays for almost a week if I keep it :)

1759	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Truth and Flare is a beautiful spring color, I love it!
I used to have normal/ combination skin which has become drier over time. Therefore, I've progressed to gentler products to wash my face, and have moved to cream-based cleansers for the most part, but which still require water to finish. This product is extremely smooth in texture, is not runny, but not solid- more like a light lotion, and it has a somewhat strong (i could still smell it on my face after it dried), but not unpleasant floral fragrance. The front of the tube says it is a "One step cleanser sensitive skin 1. Cleaning milk 2. Toner, 3. Eye make-up remover." I put this on my unwashed made-up face at the end of the day, as the directions say you can do, and it did glide on very easily. I wiped it off with a pad, and it removed my eye makeup with no problem, and most of my foundation looked to be removed as well. My face felt very moist and soft (not oily), and it dried to "normal" skin texture after about two minutes.
Now, for the results. It did tame the frizzies, but it didn't get rid of them all together. It did improve the quality of my hair. It felt softer, stronger, easier to manage. It seemed to be hydrated without feeling greasy.
3403	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Another great color from opi, girl friend loves it.
Basically, I like how my face feels after applying this serum, but the scent is really too much for me.
677	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I use this on my scars and it works like magic to make the skin heal well and look nice. I also use it on really dry skin. There is a smell but not noticeable when you rub it in.
POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE
4974	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	As I mentioned in my last review, I have a serious issue with dry skin during the winter.
3065	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is a unique anti-aging product. The contents in the bottle looks just like the picture. The colors are separated and don't blend when gently shaken. I am fascinated with the beautiful separation of colors. The directions say to massage 3 to 4 drops of the oil onto your face and neck. I have found that I have to add a little more than that because it absorbs pretty quickly and that amount wouldn't stretch to cover all the suggested areas. I have bee using about a third of the dropper. The oil has an almost earthy smell and reminds me of some of the Essential Oils that I use. The ingredients are listed on the bottom of the box, but the product sticker label was placed there and I haven't had any success removing it to read it. It doesn't leave my skin feeling oily which was something I was afraid of before using it. I follow up with my daily moisturizer and there has been no problems with that. I haven't noticed any fewer wrinkles, however, I have been using anti-aging skin care products for a few years now, so that doesn't surprise me. I haven't had any issues with skin sensitivity since using this oil either.
3832	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I don't know that this stuff really does anything - it doesn't sting like some people are saying - but it makes me feel fancy!
1668	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great neutral color, love it!
You just may want to purchase Nail Envy from a local beauty supply store unless you can find a better provider via Amazon.  It's worth every penny.
397	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This product is great for covering up anything from acne scars to tattoos. You don't need much to apply and it pretty much glides onto your skin. I use a beauty blender, I feel like it's a bit too thick for brush application. I've worn it in really hot weather and it held up really well, stayed blended onto my skin (face and chest) without needing re-application or smearing everywhere. The price is high, but this is one of those products that is well worth the money. If you need serious cover up that'll be reliable then I highly recommend this one, especially since just a little bit goes a very long way.
1624	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like the polish because it's a true deep red. I would buy more Zoya polish.....like how it drys also.
I am new to DE shaving and have already found another brand that will give me a closer shave and leathers better but at 3x the price! I do think this soap will last a very long time. Nice product!
No fragrance
For under the eyes, take the tip of the Beauty Blender and from side to side, bounce the foundation from inner to outer corner of the eye.  Again, it won't look like you are doing much at first.  Keep going.
5211	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the first time I am trying Vichy products and I think they now have a new fan. This Hydration Cream is thick and rich but not greasy at all. Every bit of it absorbed into my skin and it really feels soft. I could do without the fragrance in a face cream but it is a nice scent.
7107	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	First in 2010, we didn't like the way our 65 year old, short hair, felt after using, enough so that we didn't finish the bottle. Then in 2012, but didn't like that it seemed to leave our 67 year old hair dull and brittle, enough so that we didn't finish the bottle. 3rd time was a winner, love the scent and the way it leaves the 69 year old hair. Not sure about the thickening claim after one month.
8097	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Hair gel products are hit and miss with me. My hair is very thin with no wave so its anyones guess whether a product will be effective with me. I ordered  this product because I really liked Baxter's facial mask. The bad news is this product just didn't work for me. It is very greasy no matter how little you happen to use. I tried it several different ways and it just came up short. This is not to say the product might not be great on someone else. It just didn't work for me.
3786	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm 32 with acne prone and dry skin. Before I even knew anything about the ingredients, I fell in love with this. It's the only thing that leaves my skin feeling clean but not too tight. My mom has worked in high end retail forever so I've tried it all. And the one I received was verified to be legit from a Mario rep. in person!
I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it doesn't do much to hide fine lines.  My face is fairly smooth but I do have those lines, and this product seems to settle in to them a bit and does nothing.  It might be better with primer but I did not test this with it, so I can't say.  I did use moisturizer under the product.  If your skin looks smooth and young, this foundation should even up your skin tone and make you look fabulous.  If discoloration and making your tone more even aren't your only concerns, you might want to try something else.
4057	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I usually buy the cheapest makeup remover that I can find but after using this one, I will keep buying it. It took my makeup off completely and left my face feeling fresh.
6593	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I seriously love this stuff! I spray it all over my face before I do my makeup, spray it on my brushes or sponge while I'm applying my foundation (makes my foundation look FLAWLESS) and just as a refresher throughout the day! The price is amazing, the ingredients are good and I LOVE the smell. I'm so glad I found this!
6939	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Just one pump, blow dry and it's a straight and glossy head!  Highly recommend this product to beat summer frizzies

This hasn't weighed my hair down at all like some conditioners can. I don't put hairspray on my hair after I curl it and this conditioner is light enough that it does not cause the curl to fall flat.
846	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Although I do love the classic smell of dried roses, this lotion is rather strong when you first use it - almost overwhelmingly so.  If you are super sensitive to smells you will likely want to avoid this one.  Thankfully the scent does fade a great deal after a while although it doesn't completely go away for a long time.  As a moisturizer it works very well - it did a great job of soothing the itch on my legs caused by this dry winter air. On the hands it does feel a little bit greasy at first but does eventually rub in pretty good.  I was a little surprised when I received my bottle because it was frozen solid and bulging - I was amazed that the bottle hadn't cracked open and made a mess inside of the box. After several hours at room temp it was fine but if you're considering ordering depending on seasons where you live you may want to avoid ordering it in the winter.  There was some bubble wrap in the box with it but the bubble wrap wasn't wrapped tight around the lotion it was all kind of just rolling around inside the box.
1054	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The powder is light and is easy to apply using a fluffy brush. It doesn't add much in the way of coverage but does help set my foundation. The jar is convenient and the lid screws on tightly so there is no risk of spillage.  For the cost though I may go back to a drug store brand since I don't see a discernible difference but it is a lot more expensive.
4119	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	A little tough to get the top off the Toppik jar off but, once done the applicator works well.
2776	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this on recommendation since I was having issues starting out shaving with a DE razor.  It's not unscented, it has a "musky" scent.  I haven't found a difference between shaving with a Pre-Shave oil and Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus & Menthol and with just the Proraso.  I spent a lot of money for this and I think it was a bad investment.
 I use this as a night time face wash. So I first use a makeup wipe ( mostly just for my eye makeup so it doesn't get in my eyes) then I wash my face with this.
I now regret the purchase, while it does get hot, it does not get hot enough for my hair. I also don't recommend this size for loose fat Victorias secret curls. Go with the 1 1/4, and also a different brand. I have heard many good things about Hot tools, but I cannot recommend this curling iron for thick coarse hair. (I can't speak for thin hair)
3.  Wet the Beauty Blender and squeeze out all of the excess water.
My SO liked it, and I liked it on her.
I like a moisturizer with SPF and I would use this weekdays (when I'm mostly inside) and weekends when I'm out and about.  I find it hard to judge the effectiveness of a sunscreen until it fails for me and I try not to leave myself exposed to sunscreen failure. I'm happy with the Coola Cucumber for my current lifestyle.  The moisturizer is light and absorbs well into my skin.
2888	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My former hairdresser introduced me to this fantastic conditioner. It has a light peppermint scent. It's a conditioner that can be used on my whole head of hair (not just the ends) without causing heaviness or greasy hair. It costs a little more, but it's a quality product. I like to try different hair products, but always come back to this one. Highly recommended.
My main caveat is that it's very expensive for such a small bottle. Fortunately you don't need to use a lot each time you wash your face, but given the many options out there, I would be more likely to buy this on a regular basis if the price point was lower.
This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  I do know that is stretching it though. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional Liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!
8626	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Really like this stuff. Has a good smell, foams well. Leaves skin feeling clean. Maybe a bit overpriced, like all BJ stuff. But I'll probably continue to use it
6676	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've never had a product that claimed to make my hair thicker actually work. Well, I guess some of them did, but only because they felt yucky and you couldn't even run your fingers through your hair if you wanted to because they coated your hair with so much crap. I can't say this doesn't have any residue whatsoever, but it is so minimal that I will absolutely use it again. I am a 'no pooer' (google it) so I was worried that it would leave flakeyness or build up, but it rinsed right out. Sometimes a girl just wants to put product in her hair even if she's not supposed to! As an added bonus, this brand has way less nasties and poisons than most others out there.

trust which is very great business relationship with customers.
9804	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.
I tried the instructions from the Juice Beauty website first and I found that leaving the serum on my face made me itch.  Then I tried only applying the serum to blemishes and it had the same effect.  I then tried using the instructions from this site and rinsing it off after applying.  My skin didn't feel as itchy, but the blemishes didn't go away either.
TIPS: Tap it gently on the skin instead of rubbing on. If it feels "sticky" or thick, simply warm it between 2 fingers before using. Can be worn alone (with good color matching) or with foundation. Around the eyes, I get a much better result with using a concealer brush to "lay" the color on the skin. Use translucent powder on top (I use the white) for setting & longevity.
7343	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I started using Somme last November (2012) and just ran out of serum in June.  By contrast I ran out of everything else long before that.  I'm not sure how great a product it is, in and of itself, but in concert with the other Somme products it makes my skin look great.
I normally use Josie Maran's 100% Pure Argan Oil as my nighttime moisturizer (which is magic--I'm in my thirties and I have zero wrinkles or crows feet) and the Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer left my skin feeling almost as soft and hydrated as the argan oil. Plus it's less expensive than the argan oil--depending on usage.
Highly recomended!!

9566	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	She Who Must Be Obeyed made me get this to try.  It's a heavy scent, almost woodsy, and very sensual according to She.  I find it wears well, but not all day.  The scent fades but is still there at bath time because I've caught a faint waft of it's heady aroma before stepping into the shower. She says that's the way it should be.  I like it myself and She loves it.
The only caveat I have with this product is that you must remove your makeup for it to be at its best.  Most do anyway but sometimes I'm lazy and just do a double cleanse with my previous cleanser.  With this one it's best if you get everything off first but other than that it's really wonderful.
2614	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	It's hard to separate Eternity the scent from Eternity the image. Eternity the scent was created by Sophia Grojsman in 1988 (other scents she created: Lancome's Tresor, Estee Lauder's White Linen, Prescriptives/Clinique Calyx and YSL Paris) and is a white flower scent with a hint of green. It's lily of the valley with a bit of violet, some carnation and then white musk to give it some base. It lasts on the skin and smells unique. To me, it continues to smell clean and white, even now. I don't think it smells old fashioned or '80's'. The longer you wear it the more the white musk comes out. (Keep in mind this is NOT a dirty musk or patchouli-it's a sheer, almost crystal musk that's ripe and gives the scent staying power on the skin)
7133	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Very thick conditioner with fantastic mint/menthol smell. The smell is more herbal than the shampoo and pairs nicely with the Jack Black body wash. Leave your hair feeling smooth, and tames some of the wiry hair that I have. Expensive, but worth it.
7466	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	We love this lotion - my husband too - I buy it by the jar now for the home and in the small tube for travel. It's expensive, but worth every penny if you've tried others before and were disappointed.
Like other Crabtree and Evelyn products, the floral scent is perfected to be both subtle and long lasting at the same time. This is excellent as a daily moisturizer but its not thick enough, in my opinion, to work well on really dry places like heels or elbows. But its good for everything else, especially hands.
9986	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.
Sensitive Skin
6149	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I like products that multitask, as I like a no-fuss morning routine.  Having SPF included in my daily moisturizer is perfect, because I rarely remember to apply SPF for normal work days.  This moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs quickly and smells pleasant.
Keeps it from getting dry in winter too.
4120	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered this along with a couple sizes of toppik bottles, including the .97 that it is supposed to fit. It fits NONE of them. What a completely senseless situation. Who is running this company? Such a seemingly basic thing - make all your bottle openings the same size and make an attachment that actually fits them.
4194	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this product line. This toner gives me a good fresh feeling, tightens my skin just enough. Never too much.
1001	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Good product. I bought these to use before micro dermabrasion and they work well for that-not too harsh. The only issue I have with them is that they are very thin and hard to separate. I always end up having to handle a second pad to get the first & I worry about contamination since the second pad goes back in the jar and sits there for a few days.

1050	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Although this is lighter than expected, it does a great job!  My face didn't look white after being applied as directed.  It did look a little lighter, but considering it's as white as can be, I was surprised that it went on well.
So, with Noxzema Menthol effectively gone for Americans, M + G is a worthy substitute.
1306	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I mix it with the light blonde to get closer to my shade.  Good product, just hard to tell colors from picture.
1979	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	just what I was looking for. 1 coat is enough to still see your nails but have a wonderful gel like milky white with a hint of pink layer. no streaking whatsoever, coverage is nice and even. absolutely gorgeous with zoya top coat (armor) on top-extremely shiny. very classy! would work for any occasion
- great looks : the chrome unlike the Matt version just adds more flare in my opinion.
I estimate, if you use these products every day, the set will probably last you about 2 months, especially shaving cream which fills up the biggest just but is very fluffly and light and will surely be used up very quickly.
975	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a great product.  It has kept my skin smooth and acne free for almost two years now.
6112	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm a fan of creamy cleansers over foaming cleansers and this one by Mario Badescu is great.  I have dry, acne-prone, sensitive skin and this worked perfectly with my skin type.  It creates a nice creamy lather and gets skin very clean, but without stripping moisture or leaving a residue behind.  I still slightly prefer my current cleanser (Glamglow Thirsty Cleanse) to this because I like the scent better, but this is still a very effective cleanser.
A deodorant is simply going to help prevent odor caused by bacteria. Companies try different ways to accomplish that... either by fragrance to cover up the odor, some form of "absorbing" ingredient like baking soda, some sort of anti-bacteria agent, or some combination of these. Of all the products I used over the last several years, none have effectively worked for more than a few hours. It was very frustrating. I tried a Tom's of Maine product, another product called Naturally Fresh and several others along the same idea. None of them worked for me very well.
Okay, so with that preface out of the way, let's talk about each item:
Great great iron the best. My hair stylist only uses this one in the most expensive salon in Boston.

8303	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I wore this color with butter LONDON's Stag Do and they went well together. This color has a shimmer/rainbow effect once it is on your nails and is just gorgeous. It is more of a sheer color, but I feel it's very summery. I would highly recommend purchasing this color.
8642	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I really love this lotion! It's light and absorbs quickly, but does a great job moisturizing, And while I often get unscented products because I find the regular versions have odors that are too strong for my taste, this has a light, gardenia-like fragrance that I adore. I'm definitely going to try other products from this company.
1789	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Absolutely love this polish!!!  It stains the nails so be sure to use a good basecoat...but LOVE IT!
2484	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this for about a week now, twice a day for two minutes at a time like instructed.  I do not smoke, but I drink coffee and cola on a daily basis and I can't believe the results I got after only ONE use!  Not to mention, after a week's time my teeth are now shiny and white, I cant' believe how well this has worked!  I have tried the Sapphire whitening system (from the dentists office) and that doesn't even COMPARE to supersmile!  Needless to say, I won't be using the Sapphire system anymore!

2423	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Just started using this product again. Have used this in the past and it works wonders. My skin feels tighter and has a smoother appearance after 1 bottle. I have used 3x 5x and 10x strength and I recommend starting at a lower concentration and working your way up. If you do not have sensitive skin you may want to start at 5x. This is a great product and you only have to apply it at nighttime. The smell is quite pleasant also in my opinion.
3290	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have thin hair, and when it gets long, it becomes unmanageable and looks like $%#(. :) I was browsing a site that recommended this brand, so I gave it a try. The pomade is very sticky, but once a little amount is rubbed into my hair, it stays put, but does not look glossy or shinny like other types of hair products. This little jar will last a long time. Highly recommended!
I would be willing to try another color by this brand, but I can't recommend this one.
9826	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This stuff is kind thin and doesn't seem to give as smooth a shave as the regular proraso cream. The lighter smell is ok but it just doesn't lather well. I have sensitive skin and love Proraso's regular line of products but this white label "sensitive skin" line is too sensitive for me. I'll stick to the regular proraso line.

1833	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy
The glass jar adds to the high-end feel of this product. That also makes it easy to recycle, which I really like.
4666	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Was not impressed - but would probably be a good fit for someone with more sensitive skin. I needed more than this.
Its box directions are pretty funny, if you don't mind your candle being sort of insulting. Its instructions are also printed on the glass of the candle, in case you thought you could get away from the sass.
I am so happy to have found this foundation! My only concern is that my budget had previously allowed for a $10 Covergirl foundation. But this Vincent Longo has knocked my socks off!
2257	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Good product
- First it was gentle on my skin. It didn't burn or leave my face red.

It's good for what it claims to do, and it would probably be a lot easier to apply and remove over face makeup.
The results from the other brands are practically identical, at least when it comes to its effect on the skin, but Evian is just more dependable. Theres no leaking from the nozzle, no uneven spraying, no clogs, and all the water gets used up.
4651	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	After 2 weeks, even though I am during my monthly hormonal fluctuation that generally results in more breakouts, I have noticed that my skin is indeed more clear. So on that basis alone this is a 5-star skin kit!

6929	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My husband was a little leery of using a gel, instead of a foaming cream.  However, once he had tried this, he immediately threw away his old shave cream.  He used to get cream in his ears - no more.  He gets a lovely, smooth shave.

Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.

I'm not saying I'm a Butter London fan just yet lol, but I did like this polish enough to order a second color. When I saw my polish outdoors the next day, I ordered 3 more bottles of Butter London polish from Amazon lol. While I'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one, I'm happy I finally gave this brand a try.
I am in my late 30s, I have combination skin, I have super dry skin around my eyes, oily around my nose, and the rest of my face changes moisture levels frequently.  I still get acne, I have gigantic pores and am prone to blackheads.  My skin is also extremely sensitive.  I can't handle harsh cleansers or heavy fragrances, and certain chemicals - my face gets red, it feels hot, and I can't stand my own skin.
9362	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I was looking forward to trying the Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Serum, but it isn't for me.  First of all, this is the first product that I have tried from this brand so I can't comment on how good it is in conjunction with the other products that they recommend that you use with this.  I wash my skin with Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming cleanser.  I used this afterwards.
This goes on easy, dries quickly and removes without much effort.
6743	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is one of the best curling irons I've purchased! However, I wish I bought a smaller barrel, the 1' 1/4" barely gives me curls. I am still debating whether to buy a smaller barrel in addition or stick with the one I already got.
I've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed AFTER application!). The stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. As far as the colors, after some trial and error, I mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. I've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and I had to blend the medium and light to make it work. I ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so I can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.
Ultimately, I gave up using this kit other than the peel and the blemish clearing stick (which you'd buy separately). Only using up what I have left of the peel as I've found one made with similar ingredients for WAY less than what the standard jar costs. And ounce for ounce the stick isn't exceptional.
This product has been around for a long time.  Keeping a firm 100 percent good reputation for quality ingredients. Unlike many brands that often change ingredients.

656	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Some of the best acne cream I've ever used and I've tried everything. I will ALWAYS by this from now on! Love PCA products.
Another great pro is the ability to cover and the length of time it keeps covering.  Having coverage for 24 hours is what I am experiencing.
I have two colors of this foundation- Sand Beige, and Medium Beige.  Both are as I expected and I did like the trueness of the colors.  they were not too one way or another as is the way with many foundation lines.  Medium Beige is more pinky in tone and Sand Beige a bit more butter cream yellow in tone.  I will update in the future with other foundation colors for comparison when I get the chance to do so.

3695	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I love La Roche Posey products, but this just doesn't meet my expectations. First of all, it burns really bad, but also causes me to breakout and I haven't had breakouts in years. I do not have sensitive skin and am used to glycolic acid peels, but for some reason I am sensitive to something in this formula. This is a hard pass for me.
3) Shaving cream (about a cup)
695	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I ordered this hoping that it would be a sulfate-free shampoo since I tend to be sensitive to sulfates (I get itchy from them).  It is not, but it does not make me itchier so I used it for a number of days.  The scent is lightly minty, it does not lather up too much and my hair was definitely soft and manageable afterward.  The pump bottle squirts out a small amount of shampoo - you don't risk pouring out way too much shampoo that way!
1609	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	Very disappointing
The product doesn't remain sticky or heavy. It is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave skin looking shiny or oily.
All these product work.  Do yourself a favor and also buy the scrub (the only scrub my dermatologist has ever recommended), and the repair cream.  I wish this had been around when I was younger.

This color has a more pink base to it, but is not so pink that it looks strange like some foundations.  This is more suitable for cooler complexions, but not limited to.
3117	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Fast easy way to clean my brushes ! Although the scent is tangy and strong when you are washing them but I don't mind it .
5824	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this product since 1995 and am very satisfied with its non-greasy feel and the SPF factor.

9298	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I am using my husbands account. I like this bronzer ok. I am fair skinned and with a light hand it works really well. I like it a lot and I would order it again but I don't like it quiet as much as my the balm Betty Lou bronzer.
When this foundation arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the shade was just not right. I'd read the reviews and heard that Bisque was good for fair skin, but MY extremely pale Swedish skin would not have it. It looked orange to me, and I would have looked like an oomp-loompa wearing this shade. I've used enough makeup in the past to know immediately that this was not my shade. I was so disappointed but still wanted to try this product out in my shade! I'd been intrigued by the awesome reviews. So I took it to my local Vincent Longo counter to try out the other shades. Sure enough, the makeup artist helped me find that the lightest (of course) shade called Porcelain was the best on my skin. Before purchasing, you might want to go to the actual local Vincent Longo counter to have them test the shades on you before settling on one. Bisque was far too dark on me. Upon hearing my plight and seeing I had an unused product in the wrong shade, the Vincent Longo makeup artist insisted on an even exchange do that I could use and review this makeup properly. I ended up taking home the Porcelain shade to use--same product, different shade. On that note, can I also say that this company's customer service was above and beyond?
7293	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	The hubby and I both use this product, am getting my hair relaxed again and this gives me a little spike into my hair when I want it.

Cons:
557	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I got this foundation in golden beige, and it is way darker than the image and swatch on Amazon shows, so it is too dark for me. Just to be sure I applied it when I didn't have to go anywhere anyway. I would caution that you should consider using a beauty sponge to apply this to get a lighter application because this truly is full coverage and looked a little cakey on the side that I used to blend with a buffing brush (when I first try a foundation I usually do one side with a brush and one with a beauty sponge to see which give the best coverage and overall look. This still looked dark on me despite using the sponge to do the lightest possible coverage. Just please beware, the color is much darker than that shown on the Amazon page.

6805	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Don't know what was the hype about all over you tube, i get occasional break out and this product did not help. I normally love Mario Badescus product and currently addicted with Cleansers and toners but drying lotion didn't was ok. Read my full review at [...]
1976	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	love essie polish! I had to have this color because its great for summer and for accents. a must have!
- Upon application, the moisturizer leaves the skin with a dewiness that generates a brighter appearance, but never oily or greasy.
4098	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This cream helps with very chapped finger tips & dry nails/cuticles.  I wear this at night during winter when I need a little TLC.  I put this on first & then use a heavy hand cream on top.  The scent is a light herbal fragrance.  The texture is a little greasy as you would expect but it melts in fairly quickly.  This is a small tube but a little goes a long way so gets me thru the winter.

It is the ultimate hydrator and a little goes a long way.  I use it once in the morning and again before bed.  We are experiencing REALLY DRY weather and this does the trick.  Lip balms hydrate but tend to be waxy and don't last very long on my lips.  Other high-end lip serums have been very sticky.  This one is perfect: it leaves a very nice, slight shine but most importantly, it works REALLY well.


3077	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I do think I see a marked improvement in the tiny lines around my eyes and mouth.  This is a very slick and oily serum and takes a while to be absorbed into your skin, so I've been using it a night rather than as a day moisturizer under my makeup.
788	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This makeup feels weird.  If I were rich I might buy it just to poke it with my finger.  It's kind of fun that way.  It reminds me of a cold gel shoe insert- it is VERY different.
Mainly, it's the smell. It's incredible, (which with single blend oils you don't get any scent really). And it is equally amazing on any part of my body, be it hair, face, legs or torso.
I am 53 and have light Caucasian skin.  I don't know about strengthening the skin barrier, so you can read the rest on the box that Amazon has featured in the pictures.
I love this pencil...and the little sharpener that comes with it is a nice bonus.
Plus, I should add this important note: M + G offers as close and invigorating a shave as the famous Kiehl's White Eagle cream, but M + G has one clear advantage: it rinses much easier and cleaner from the razor.

My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have sun spots. Now I get it.  This particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  It is lovely.

361	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I am now a real fan or Dermablend!  I got this for my daughter who loves makeup and knows more about it than I do.  She was very impressed by this as well.  The thick creamy texture allow you to easily apply less or more depending on the amount of coverage that you need.  It actually covers so good that you will not need a concealer with this.  I like the way that it can be applied with anything that you like.  A sponge, makeup brush or just your fingers will all work.  It's up to you to do what you want with it unlike liquid foundation.  It also doesn't rub off as much as any other foundations that I have tried.  I would recommend that you remove it with a good quality makeup remover rather than trying to get it off with regular soap.  I love the way that you can get a very natural look with this.  I can't say anything negative about this makeup.
I followed the directions, applied with my fingers directly to my dry face and eye area using a circular motion.  Then, I wet my hands and continued to massage my face, creating a milky emulsion. Rinsed off with water. My skin felt smooth, and according to the info, the camellia oil  does moisturize and soften my skin. During the day I do not wear much make up,but this did remove my eye make up and cheek blush without much effort. My skin did not feel tight or stretched. This cleanser seems to have been tested for all skin types and sensitivities. There is a very light scent.

The 8 oz bottle is easy to handle and use.  The screw off top has a nice opening to allow you to get the amount you need to use, unlike some flip lids that don't make it hard to get product out of the container.  allow  The lime green color of the product is nice.  The cleansing soap is a little thick but thats the way it should be.  Message a small amount of cleansing soap onto your skin in a circular motion.  Rinse with warm water.  My skin felt clean and not dry.

It also didn't leave me fire truck red like so many other products. Also it doesn't have a chemical scent like other products. I love how "clean" the ingredients are compared to similar products. I'm not plagued with tons of wrinkles or fine lines, so I'm using this more as a preventative. So far, I'm impressed. I'll up date my review after continued use.

Yes, it's in glass, which is fabulous! You can save it after use (just run it through the dishwasher). I'll use it for some of my homemade creams.
Also, it seems to be a great base for my polish.
I would recommend all for skin with rosacea problems.

But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.
This is definitely a keeper, and a product that I will purchase again, make up tends to last me a very long time!
And, what's not to like? The antioxidant mixture is mostly natural ingredients and the serum appears to be quickly absorbed. She's telling me that the the skin of her face feels firmer and, most importantly, there is no discomfort.
No irritation and the splotches and minor blemishes are clearing up by the day. I do follow it with the Cucumber Lotion and then a moisturizer. Badescu products are very reasonable in price, and do what they promise.
It's not gonna stay on overnight. It's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat. I've even tried holding spray and it will work but I personally have to gel my hair so hard that it's not favorable all the time. Those are the only downsides. Take it from me and my friends..it works and its amazing :)
4698	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I needed to change my review. After a few weeks of use- I have broken out worse than anything in my life. My skin has never been in this bad of shape in my life even in my teenage years! Bioelements and I clearly do not work well. I switched back to Dermalogica and instantly cleared up. Never switching again in my life.

9801	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.
The feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes.  When I do this, I feel a lot of silicone feel to it.  This leaves my face feeling like it has saran wrap on it of sorts.  It is hard to explain, but after a while of wearing this primer, I feel like my face wants to breathe and I want to remove it.


4649	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is a fantastic set! It lasted over two months. I saw results after a week. Everything is effective. My favorite product is the moisturizer - it's light, grease-free, and it feels like pure relief when you apply it.

This went on more smoothly than most polishes I've used lately (over an OPI base coat).  It dried quickly.  I used two coats to get it fully opaque, but depending on your preferences, you might be able to get by with one thick coat.  I got only one tiny bubble that you can hardly even see (I've had much worse bubbling problems with other polishes).  So far, I don't have any shrinking or chips although that might change when I clean house later tonight.  But about 18 hours after application, it still looks nearly perfect.  I'd say this was one of the better-performing Zoya polishes I've used in that regard.  (I have quite a few of them.)
8199	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased this product when I read a review on Amazon.com.  Well, I do not find it as amazing as the reviewer did.  I hardly use it now.  I love the Butter London products, but this is not my favorite.
Check this out... It really works!

9947	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.
3526	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	Every time I use this base coat, my CND polish wears off too quickly. Too bad since I like the large round bottle and other CND products have been great. Maybe its not meant to be used with CND Vinylux Weekly Polish?


75	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	It chip My wife nails in a day. If you have a nail gel nail dryer? Then stick with or go with the gel nail polish. It last longer than this stuff.
3337	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Best nail polish remover I have ever used! I got multiple layers of polish off both my hands in with two cotton balls.
3794	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	I think that either Badescu changed the formula, or this is not the original cleanser. This smells much more citrusy and burns my eyes. It is not the formula that i have always bought directly from the Mario Badescu site.
5895	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	good
521	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I really like this foundation! I haven't tried cream foundation before, and I found it easier to blend than a regular liquid foundation. I found it slightly darker than my skin tone, but I like it and will keep using it. I like that once apply it, it doesn't feel crusty or sticky. It comes with a little spatula to get a chunk out, but I prefer to use my fingers so I can put it on lightly. I use this over my blemishes, you can hardly see them after applying. For the 1 oz, a little goes a long way!


6377	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the nicest soaps I have used. It smells great and delivers a deep down clean. It also removes all smells that you don't want. It is gently though. Great buy!

2128	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Yes it is much more expensive than something you would find at your local pharmacy. However, I feel that the money is worth it. The tube itself is small, and I wish the cap was larger so that I could stand it up easily. Even with those drawbacks, this toothpaste works much better at removing stains and keeping teeth white, than most toothpastes you can find. I got tired of using a sonic toothbrush which started making my teeth feel sensitive and wanted to go back to something that would work well with a standard brush and this caught my eye.
5667	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	My hair has been thinning for the last 15+ years and I have done everything to make up for it short of a transplant - wigs, weaves, etc. even though my own hair is quite long. I heard about Toppik and got this small travel size because I just had a hard time believing it would actually work, and I didn't want to risk too much money on it. Well, I absolutely LOVE Toppik! I'm a cook and an artist so I have a good hand, which meant I was successful in my first attempt at applying it and it only took a few minutes. just aim over the area, and tap the fibers on. The hair on the top of my head is quite thin, so I did have to apply more than some others might have to, but it does what it says, and I was so thrilled it brought tears to my eyes and I am buying a larger size. Yes, you can run your hands through it, and yes, you can style it. If you have thinning hair, I cannot recommend this product enough. TIPS: I read it before in the reviews and now I know it myself - get a shade lighter than your hair. I got the Dark Brown, and it looks almost Black upon application. I am able to get away with it, but my next order with be the medium brown and I will mix them. Also, if you need to apply a lot of it, which I did, it will result in the Toppik-treated area looking duller than the rest of your hair. I tried a little shine spray with my hair out and some holding gel with my hair up, and both seemed to work in getting the shine back. Some folks have complained of itching, but I haven't had that issue. I tried sleeping with it in just for giggles, and some came out, but not that much. I have not yet gotten it wet, so I cannot comment on that. If you're still skeptical, do what I did and at least try the travel size so your risk is minimal. But I am a happy customer - no more wigs and weaves and I can finally have my own hair out without being self-concious. Thank you, Toppik!!
So, I was nearing the end of the jar, and I began to notice that my forehead lines were softening and my laugh lines were also not as noticeable as before. I was officially sold on this product! Not only had it basically cleared up my skin (aside from a hormonal related pimple here and there near my cycle), but my skin also appeared so much more youthful!
3057	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Even sensitive, irritated, acne prone skin needs moisture. This gentle serum is made with skin supporting ingredients. Among the active ingredients is hyaluronic acid, a moisture magnet. Vitamin B-5 soothes and relieves itching while mushroom extract evens pigment and smoothes. Centella asiatica is both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory and believed to promote healing. Pump a sparing amount of the serum and apply to clean dry skin in the morning and evening.
2759	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this stuff! Addicted. It makes your hair so shiny and not greasy at all.
3900	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This is the greateset every day polish, and my nails don't break!
4614	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I am 39, AA, with oily, acne-prone skin. I don't have any wrinkles or fine lines, but I do have dry feet and dry hands. I have used this twice at night, but it is too oily for my skin. However, I LOVE the way it smells and it has a thick consistency. So, onto my feet it goes!


3310	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love 2 for one products because they save space in my bag.  This lip pencil has a bold reddish/brownish end and a pinkish/nude end.  The pencil works with multiple shades and the creamy texture goes on easy but lasts a long time.  Excellent pencil.

4677	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this - great stuff!
1019	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This is more of a rose pink..kind of like bazooka bubblegum when you first open the wrapper!  I prefer a darker shade but this looks  good on and for what it makes my lips feel like..it was worth ordering.  I don't think I've ever had a lipstick that I put on at 6am, drank coffee off and on and finally ate some late lunch...still can feel the protection on my lips.  They're soft and smooth and I haven't reapplied during the day.  I can't really notice that the color is still there but my lips feel "coated" and soft and smooth as I said.  I'm thinking all the colors may be a bit lighter than what they show up as online.

After you have dried your hair (using all of the products you normally apply), sprinkle the Toppik onto the areas that need to look fuller.  Lightly tap the area to help the keratin particles `grasp' the hair.  Once you have filled in these spaces, you may lightly style your hair.  Vigorous brushing will remove Toppik so, don't do it.  Toppik should remain in place until you brush or shampoo.
1781	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love this Essie color! Essie polishes are some of my favorite nail polishes. They self level better than any nail polish I have ever tried. They coat very well, and for the majority of the colors Essie nail polishes are very opaque. They dry very quickly as well. This color is a very cheery, vibrant sky blue. Almost completely opaque with only one coat. One of my all time favorites!
It has a pleasant, neutral scent. It smells like baby to me. It is clear and gel-like. That's all that I like about it, really.
My skin is sensitive and can react strongly to harsh ingredients, but this doesn't irritate it at all.

1472	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I love this product.  I have received countless compliments on the color "Pasha" used on my toenails.
Mario Badescu Moisture Magnet is something that I was very interested to try because I have recommended this line to several people that I know who have extremely sensitive skin with a lot of problems such as eczema, rosacea, and random skin problems that limit them in what they can use on their skin.  They are not willing or able to use diet to control their skin problems (very effective) and they still need to use something.
265	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	This polish has so many different shades in it--fuschia, coral, blue.  It changes in every different light, and flatters different skin tones. It wears very well. And I love OPI polish.  Buying a refill.  Don't want to run out!
And the price point? For what you get, $24 is a great deal.
I can't imagine doing my makeup without this now and am so pleased with the results. I've wanted to try a floral water for a long time, this is my very first one and I'm sticking with it. L O V E it. Can't recommend it enough.
4410	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I've been trying to better my night time skincare routine as I get older, and eye makeup remover has definitely been a missing piece for too long. I typically use Lumene Radiant Touch Cleanser and wash my face twice, but I never realized how much eye makeup was left behind. I'm a mom of two boys, and though I definitely have dark circles, this was partially due to left behind makeup that still remained the next morning. I've now been washing my face, removing my eye makeup with this La Roche makeup remover, and then using a serum (Lumene Bright Now VitaminC Hyaluronic Essence), and my complexion is truly great. My eyes are bright and my eyelashes feel conditioned. Best of all, this product is not greasy at all.  I will 100% keep using this on a go forward basis.
Then I needed something for thicker beard. I usually shave on Mondays and Saturdays, and recently had an even longer beard, so I tried the SLANT.  Wow! It mowed right through on the first pass. I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.
6596	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Yum.... love Mario B. products, they never disappoint!
44	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	Picked this up for my husband who was looking for a fresh new scent to try. I love how the citrus and wood tones smell on him. I put a little on my wrist and the scent changed more than I expected. This is truly an adaptable scent.

2080	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	1.0	I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.
Opi:
1912	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love their colors!
The scent is light, and the bottle will last a while since you only need a small amount.  So it's a solid value for the price.  Color me impressed.  Now I just wish it came in travel size bottles.
941	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Great product, rich color, lasts all day.

One thing that I must mention is that Proraso is sold in America as Bigelow Shaving Cream. When I bought a bottle from here I was disapointed that when it arrived from the seller (LCI) it was damaged and unusable. I use amazon for the convenience, I don't have time to box stuff up and ship it back.  So I went to the store that carries this product, and found that they had a buy 2 get 1 free sale. So I tossed this one, and just got 3 of the Bigelow creams (exact same ingredients) for 20 bucks plus tax. Now I am set for the next few months.
I took the advice of some others here and put the product into my hand first instead of directly into my hair. I rub in lightly into my palms and then into my hair. It takes three separate squeezes for my hair, but again, that's because my hair is greasy the day after I wash it. The end result is wonderful. It's not like actually washing my hair, of course, but it really dries up the grease and gives my hair body. I can easily go an extra day between washes now, which is going to make a huge difference in how my color holds over time.
3406	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	OPI PRODUCTS ARE GREAT !  The polish stays on without chipping for at least a week
3717	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	It didn't take much of this cleansing gel to get my face feeling clean and surprisingly soft. I wasn't expecting it to soften my skin but it does feel softer. I still use moisturizer but it's nice to have a cleanser that doesn't dry out my skin. I would  say the one drawback is the price, currently at $40 USD. Otherwise, a very good product.
1390	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I always re-order this product. My previous reviews no longer exist because the reseller is gone so I am going to c&p my original review.
I love the organic ingredient list.  You have your nutrient-rich organic shea and jojoba - both very smooth and rich on my skin [with proper care before you apply].  Also aloe and algae - those may not sound so appealing, but I'm sure great on skin.
7259	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I'm 50 years old. I've used Everyday minerals forever but since my skin has "matured" I noticed that it left my face looking heavy and left the texture of my skin rough. I tried everything, even liquid and BB creams but hated it all. I didn't give up and found this at the counter in a make up store at my local mall. I took a big chance since they did not do any refunds but the girl told me that I wouldn't be returning it. She did tell me that if the color was not good that she would exchange it. I'm glad she did because the Teakwood color was much too orange for my winter color and exchanged it for this. The color is perfect for my Asian yellow undertones and blends very well. Does not show off my fine lines/pores at all. I just apply some dark peach concealer (by Bobbie Brown) under my eyes and dust this all over my face. I've gotten alot of compliments since I started wearing this. Alittle goes a long way too.

Anyway, this stuff is my lifeline to amazing legs and everything else that gets shaved. Seriously, if you haven't tried it as a shave gel you're missing out. Go now and shave if you have it, or buy it if you don't and see. It's heaven sent.
981	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	These are a handy drink of glycolic acid for the skin and seem to give your face and nice glow after a coulle of weeks of use 2 times a day.

214	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Nice summer color
6852	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	This works really well, burns like Hell when you first use it (I have sensitive white girl skin). My skin has adjusted, and this seems to work well. Most of my acne only lasts two-three days when I put this on them over night. HATE washing this off in the morning though, literally have to scrub it out of my facial hair. Make sure you're reading the instructions and DON'T SHAKE IT.
442	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have hyper-pigmentation scars on my face; they take up to a year to fade away. I usually use any cover up and get okay coverage and deal with the shadowed look on my face. I tried the DermaBlend and the scars/spots disappeared for the day. It can't hide the texture of your skin as well, but even that blended out a bit. I am happy to report the product will get me through the dark spot phase.
8221	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased "seaside". The nail polish goes on opaque in 2 coast. I use the base and a top. I get a lot of compliments all the time!!! The nail polish lasts a long time and I do a lot with my hands as a stay at home mom. I have 2 small kids and wash my hands constantly. This picture was taken on day 5 on me wearing it. As you can see it looks like I just painted them!!! Highly recommend.
1299	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	4.0	I was very skeptical about this product, but I bought a smaller bottle on sale at Sally's and it is AMAZING. My thinning hair has been my biggest source of insecurity for the past ten years. It is all I could focus on when I looked at myself in pictures or when getting ready. I was sure everyone was always thinking "she would be pretty if her hair wasn't so THIN". This stuff works! It covers up the visible scalp and you cannot tell it is a topical "fiber" unless you get your eyes centimeters away. I have had so many compliments on how my hair looks and I recently had family pictures taken - I know without this product I would have just been sad about how awful my thinning part looked - now I post pictures with confidence. Only wish I would have tried it sooner!! Now I bought the largest size available from Amazon and it is less than half the price of Sally's. I hope they never stop making it!!
741	Luxury_Beauty_5	NEG	2.0	This is no better than any other hair spray.  Just buy some generic spray on sale at the drug store.  The Toppik fibers, hair fattener and pump attachment are really good products.
2222	Luxury_Beauty_5	POS	5.0	Love these pads.
