Seducing Jane Porter is none of the above.  This  novel is surrounded by some interesting characters wrapped in pretty packaging filled with class.  Dominique Adair created a fun world that is obtainable.  Some prefer to read books that could only be fantasies.  Perhaps this is one of those books to you.  But, the characters, the stories, the depth .. this book is well written and left me smiling.

Ky is an altogether believable character, one that I at times admired and cheered along, feeling as though I were going through the motions of a first time captaincy.  Her interactions with Gary and Quincy and the other officers and staff was not forced or unbelievable, but accurate (seemingly at least, after all I have never been on a space ship) and to the point.

Whether chasing shadows on the beach or weathering the storms of life, family and friends are what get us through the good and bad times. Holly Jacobs is a master at representing real family life in her books and helping us to realize what love and life are all about. She can make us sigh with happiness, cry with sorrow, and laugh out loud at the humor. I know after reading Same Time Next Summer, I am reminded that family is what really matters. I can already see myself on my next beach vacation, chasing shadows alongside of the little ones in my extended family. We may not catch the shadows, but we will certainly catch happy memories. That's what really matters in the long run.
In the final chapter on belief, Boyer discounts Robert Nozick's widely held explanation of religion as `a particular feature of the human mind that creates the whole of religion, a central metaphysical urge that is the origin of all religion, an irredeemable human propensity to superstition, myth and faith'. Yet, rather frustratingly, Boyer admits that the `central question: Why do some people believe and not others? . . . is very likely to remain unsolved'. Overall it seems that the varieties of religious experience rest on the varieties of mental experience and the social utility of following such beliefs within a religion.


And Max.  Such a vulnerable yet strong man.  He knows what he wants and even though he obviously loves Hunter, he isn't willing to settle for less than he wants and deserves.

I have the strong feeling that Remi's character is changed a lot from the previous enstallment. In Without Reservation he is an interesting supporting character, but apart the physical beauty and a cocky attitude, no more else gave you the real impression of him. Instead he is a complex character, with a secret past which is a real twist in the actual story (no want to give off the story, so no hints on it).
His domination was supposed to be all for her pleasure, but where is his consideration for her pleasure, her heart, her feelings, her peace of mind, ANY OTHER TIME?!? He was going to make this decision, but he didn't even really consult Sarah. While he is gone, he sounds off over the limited communication time he has to another woman. He comes back and expects her to fall into his arms in a very, "where's my supper, wench," sort of way. He gets jealous, but doesn't understand that she might be have feelings, too, like, say, jealousy over the other woman he has talked to more than he talked to her. Disregards her in decision-making, controlling, displays a complete lack of understanding of her feelings...hmm, still not spelling "good husband material" to me.

The week after they realize they are destined mates, Gabe is called to begin intensive training with the elite hunter agency that polices rogue shifters.  It is both a dream come true - because of the opportunity to train and learn from the best of the best - and a nightmare - because of being separated from his newly discovered, unclaimed mate.  Gabe, like the dominant, alpha he is, decides that he doesn't need to mark Sarah and make their mating official until he gets back - he thinks the separation so soon after joining would be even harder on them.  Of course, this does not turn out to be the best course of action, since some stupid decisions on his part - including his close friendship with another female shifter in town who he manages to stay in touch with more often than his mate - as well as his giving said female friend jewelry as a Christmas present while he is home on leave and Sarah is away (Sarah thinks he didn't get her anything because he wants to give her her gift in person - of course he doesn't tell her this) - leave Sarah feeling abandoned and unloved for most of the 6 long and agonizing months that they are apart. Needless to say, when they finally meet up again at the airport for a trip to a friend's wedding & Gabe's friend, Chloe, makes a huge public display by running and jumping into his arms for an extended hug while Sarah looks on before he even says so much as hello to her - Sarah is seriously hurt and angry and definitely doesn't roll out the welcome mat for him.  Read to find out how they resolve their issues - this book is steamy and funny - like some of the other books in this serious.  I highly recommend it.

COUNTDOWN occurs some four years after the events of BLIND ALLEY. Jane MacGuire, now a 21-year-old college student, is a success by any definition as she juggles work, education, friends, and family with equal aplomb. She is still haunted, however, by the memory of the intriguing, enigmatic, and dangerous Mark Trevor. When an attempted kidnapping of MacGuire ends unsuccessfully, but nonetheless tragically, Trevor makes a sudden and dramatic return into MacGuire's life. Trevor, for the sake of MacGuire's safety, spirits her away to an ancient, brooding castle in Scotland, where the two of them must confront their unresolved and unrefined feelings for each other while dealing with the dangers of the outside world.

The Plot: Wildwood Dancing is a retelling of the Twelve Dancing Princesses fairy-tale. The main character, Jenica, is responsible for looking out for her four sisters while their father is away from the castle for health reasons. Jena struggles to maintain control with her domineering cousin, Cezar, attempting to seize control. Cezar is deeply troubled by the loss of his elder brother, Costin, who is believed to have been taken by the folk that dwell in the mysterious forest. Cezar is determined to hunt down and kill all of the folk of the Wildwood to avenge his brother's death. This is problematic for Jenica and her sisters because they have visited the realm of the Other Kingdom for years, since they were children, and have come to regard the Wildwood folk as an extension of their family.
Okay what I did like was the anticipation of the climax. I did like Gabrielles guards.

He's treated with such ignorant rudeness that he leaves.  The writer lost two sons--I don't understand why she tossed the 3rd one away.  In another sections, she's diagnosed with Type 2 diabetis.  The MD suggests she go go a support group.  Halfway through the meeting, she leaps to her feet and lectures the other.  She tells everyone they are wimps and she's not going to allow them to get her down.  How rude, mean and condescending.  There were people there who may have to face amputation, who have to change their life styles--and she just blew their concerns off because she was so cool and clever.  She says she's a Christian and I will not judge her--but in my experience, CHristians are kinder and more loving when others are grieving.

This is a really good book. The characters (small town, generally older population) were all interesting and entertaining. I didn't see the main character, Annike, as her age--almost 40. She seemed to be younger, both in maturity and attitude.  But the chemistry between her and Sarkisian, the sheriff, is just wonderful.

Chandler's famous fictional detective, Philip Marlowe does not appear in any of the short stories in this book because these are his earlier works.  They appeared in magazines and he hadn't dreamt up Marlowe yet.  But the stories are so worth reading.

The net result is that, while you're reading, you're there, back in the Los Angeles of the 1930's and 40's, experiencing how it used to look, how it once felt, what life there was once like.  It's almost intoxicating in its effects.


4705	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I tend to shy away from books in which the characters jump right into bed after first meeting.  This book is not like that.  The main characters have a nice back story and a long history.  This was a quick read and I liked that it dealt with issues facing women in this day and age.
My Take
Having engaged in such a naughty act, Alexa is understandably distracted but with a major contract depending on her presentation she does her best to pull it together.  The last thing she expects is to see Justin enters the boardroom and introduce himself as J. Winston.  He's dressed impeccably in business attire and acting like he's never seen her before.  Alexa's furious that he would deceive her in such a manner and once the business meeting is over she unleashes her rage on him. She even goes so far as to turn down his offer of the job.  What Alexa doesn't realize is that J. Winston and Justin are not the same person but they do know each other - and because Justin has been searching for her since their dalliance letting her get away now simply isn't going to happen.
The main characters don't interact a lot with the supporting characters, but there are some interesting figures: Garrett, Kasey's brother, Paul, Kasey's teammate, but also Bo, Gram's employee and Colville, another pro basketball player. Since this is the first book in a series, I think we will have the chance to read something on one or plus of these characters.
The author did a beautiful job bringing us a romantic story of two people: Lorren Jacobs and Dr. Justin Madaris who both has some baggage that each would have to overcome before things started to happening good for them mentally, physically and even emotionally. "Tonight and Forever" was truly a good story of how these two found the true love that they both needed the second time around. The novel is definitely a attention grabber that will keep you reading and even wanting more at the end.
The only reason I didn't give the book five stars was because I understand it's short, but I think that things happened too fast between Fiona and Aidan. I understand she was scared and running, but it seems she gave in to willingly when help was offered

So, sounds almost good, right, even though this premise has been done 500 times we can suspend disbelief. The problem lies in the way it was written. In the last few chapters, there is no emotion to the way the author wrote the scenes. The lack of emotion is so noticeable such that you don't really feel the angst and suffering of h. The big reveal was too clinical. It just ruined the ending for me. There were also some threads to the story that appear to be hanging out there. It almost feels like the author started out so passionately and then just wanted to get it over with near the end.

6648	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	An interesting idea, but I would not recommend this book to my friends.  There are some errors.  I'm not sure if they are from bad formatting or from author/editor error, so I won't fault the author on that.  However, I do fault the author for not being able to decide if he was writing for an adult audience or a YA audience.  I wish he had made up his mind.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but sometimes it felt childish and other times it seemed a bit 'too much'.  YA-lit is a tough thing to write.  It's always a fine line between being too watered down and being over the top.

Elliot is the character I wanted to cuddle. Seriously. Handsome, yes. Young, sure. But in his own way, he'd lived through odd circumstances. I wanted to know a bit more about his back story and his foiled attempts at relationships, but given the length of the story, I still enjoyed learning about him. His strength was what drew me to him. He appeared fragile at times, but it merely masked his true devotion to Cade. Great stuff.
The Julian character was well so different and I found it sexy that he always called Mr. Flynn...David. I thought that was very sexy..I could almost hear him saying it softly.

Author Junot Diaz does a masterful job of weaving these stories together.  He  gives the reader a genuine insight into living in disfunctional urban America, in which getting through a school day without needing hospitalization is a triumph.  He gives the reader an equally deep understanding of the insanity of life in a violent dictatorship, and how people would try to go about their lives while steering clear of the angry, murderous people in power.  And then, Dias cuts across those worlds with characters who both live in them in the moment, but also aspire to something different and better.  You ache for the unfilled promise of Oscar, the tragedies that befell his mother, and the traumas and disappointments that so many other faced.

First of all, if the book was written in 2004, and there is no indication that it is a period piece set in the 1960s-1980s, then why name the protagonist Henry (outside of the royal family, I don't know many Henrys, especially one born in 1942: book set in 2004, Henry is 62, etc). And his wife's name was Irma? Why not Cynthia, or Nancy, or Linda -- names that were popular during the 1940s and don't have a whiff of the 1920s or 30s about them. They were married in the late 1960s -- not right after VJ Day! This may seem minor, but I have little interest in reading about a Henry, or an Irma, even though she dies before the story opens. It ages them for me --- gives, at least to me, an impression of a really, really old married couple.

What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not, if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it.

Content:  I enjoyed meeting Dr. Thorndyke and Dr. Jervis but I didn't get as attached to them as to, say, Poirot or Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes.  There was much less of "them" present in the works... although the fact that Dr. Thorndyke never quite figured out how inept Dr. Jervis was grated a little... maybe I am too used to watching Poirot and Holmes watch indulgently as Hastings and Watson bumble along to believe anyone could be blind to his inadequacies.  The mysteries themselves were generally pretty decent, and the detective work was quite interesting.  Of the three long tales one of the three was incredibly predictable, and two of the three were moderately predictable.  The short stories were far more enjoyable although they were also mostly predictable.  They were fun and kept me reading more so than the novels did.  If I had to guess at the goal of the author just from these four works I would have to say that he was trying to illustrate new methods of detection and problem solving in an entertaining way much more than he was trying to tell stories about interesting characters.

The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own.
Although the initial setup of the book may make you think this is a historical romance, it is not.  The world is generic king and castle fantasy, but there isn't any realism or research.  It's maybe England, but witches were burnt at the stake at some point (witches were hung in England and England's witch craze happened AFTER the vagueish time period of this book).  There are open lesbians (who have threeways with the queen).  Illegitimate children can somehow inherit their father's title and property.  The setting was pretty much whatever the author wanted it to be.

The lesbian part was just too much information for me and I think the book could have been well written without including that or the gay aspect.

Their strong feelings of attraction are mixed in with complicated matters that relate back approximately 400 years to one of Dr. Stafford's ancestors, Dr. John Dee who was a close confidant and advisor to Queen Elizabeth. Dr. John Dee was a mathematician and an alchemist, who also invested much of his time studying esoteric and religious matters, including how to communicate with angels. He left two keys which would unlock boxes that contained puzzling documents which were entrusted to Dr. Stafford's youngest brother, Will. The keys were supposed to be passed on to the next female in line of succession but because Mrs. Stafford had no daughters, she entrusted this family secret to Will. Will was a free-lance photographer who had travelled to dangerous areas of the world,  hot posts where revolution and famine struck. After discovering the documents entrusted to him, Will went to Chartres Cathedral in France to walk the labyrinth and experience some of what his ancestor had written about. After returning to his home in the UK, he met a tragic and unexpected death on his motorcycle after crossing a bridge not far from his destination.

That Zuckerberg was 19 years old in 2004 when he started the service as a Harvard undergraduate. And that he almost invariably dresses in T-shirts and flip-flops. Yet throughout The Facebook Effect, Kirkpatrick treats us to scene after scene in which Zuckerberg transcends his age by decades, displaying a depth of understanding, a mastery of strategy, and a steadiness of purpose worthy of the most seasoned CEO.

Anna can't believe Nikos wants to marry her.  How can he think it would work when she left him months before because she thought he was having an affair with his new secretary?  Anna had once been Nikos PA and loved the job and working for him.  She didn't count on falling in love with him, becoming his mistress and expecting his baby.  When she found out she was pregnant, everything changed.....Nikos insisted she quit her job and stay at home until the baby was born.  When she thought he was having an affair, she left and had her baby on her own.
Because there might be a way for her to escape, and this is at the beginning of the story, she accepts the latter. An honest person, she wins either the fast and loyal friendship of many, or the undying hatred.

Levin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of "under God" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.
The dialog seemed unnatural in many places.  Ellysa says of Denton (Darcy), "That would certainly present me with a great misfortune, as I am determined to despise the man" and he describes her appearance as "tolerable."  The author is trying to slip in some Austenesque language in her modern retelling, but you can't have it both ways.
Filled with memorable characters:  Oscar, who only wants to be loved, and becomes stupidly brave at the end.  His mother, the beautiful Beli, whose determination got her hurt, but regardless, she believed in love, despite so many bad things that happening to her.  Her hope was shocking.  Odd, she was so indifferent to her equally gorgeous daughter, Lola, her firstborn.

As with his prior volume, Professor Hett's research is impeccable, as reflected in 52 pages of notes (mostly German-language sources) and a helpful "Note on Sources."  Included as an appendix is a transcript of Litten's cross of Hitler that had such an impact on both their lives. The author is very skillful in explaining German legal procedures and the historical background of Litten's story.  My only complaint is there are occasional efforts to explain Litten's actions as reactions to his strict Konigsberg law professor father, which I found somewhat speculative. The book well illustrates a major truth of history: important developments often come at the hands of not particularly pleasant people.  Litten was not a warm and cuddly character--but he was an important historical personage, which we now can appreciate given this fine volume.

In short, Marx took the various strands of Enlightenment thought and action and grafted those developments onto a theory, not fully formed at the time, of how the proletariat was to arise and take over the reins of society for the benefit of all of society and end class struggle as the motor force of history. Unfortunately, given the rocky road of socialist thought and action over the last 160 years, we are, impatiently, still waiting for that new day.

Boyer's answer is a complex one, and only the barest out-line is possible here. In fact, he even makes a point out of its complexity: there isn't a simple solution to the problem "why religion". Boyer believes that religion is rooted in the way our brains work, in our cognitive processes. Many different cognitive processes are interacting to create religious concepts. Religion seems to be caused by the normal functioning of the human mind, with its decoupling, inference systems, and instincts. It may even be connected with obsessive-compulsive behaviour to relieve anxiety, not to mention the fact that counter-intuitive information is more attention-grabbing and easier to recall than normal information! Human fear of corpses is another important factor, and this fear in turn is created by the collision of several cognitive processes. If the religious concepts created by our minds are seen as socially relevant, they will tend to spread and become dominant, which explains why most religious beliefs are centred on gods and spirits, creatures that resemble humans in some ways, but seem to have access to a lot of socially relevant information. This presumably also explains why worship of ancestral spirits is one of the most common forms of religious behaviour.

My favorite part was reading about Charles and Anna meeting for the first time. I love seeing their reactions to each other and realizing that they want to be mates. It was a good call on Patricia Briggs's part to start this series, because I think Charles is such an awesome character and it's a shame we don't see him more in the Mercy Thompson series. Anna is also extremely cool; she's tough while not being overly aggressive and she's keeps calm in the face of danger. After reading about Adam saving Mercy all the time, it's kind of fun reading about a girl saving a guy's ass when he gets himself into trouble.
As for the human race being possible seven million years old, it is too far a stretch of the imagination to consider, especially as this otherwise decent theory stems from a man who believes all human societies have the same survival and learning abilities.

In this story, the Trojans sail to Llangarlia on Albion as victims of a great scheme by the great-great-granddaughter of Ariadne to reconstruct the Game (or labyrinth) of Troy upon the Veiled Hills above the banks of the River Llan.  She is the only surviving Mistress of the labyrinth and Brutus is the only surviving Kingman.  Together the two can rebuild the Trojan Game and Brutus will sacrifice almost anything to gain that power.  Strangely, however, he can't quite sacrifice Cornelia.

Not only that, she doesn't plan on maturing, on allowing for growth.

And Vampire Hunk rejoices in her difficult personality.  Seriously, dude. This may be charming now because as Vampire Hunk you are used to people bowing and scraping and kissing up to you.

The story is not very long, less than 90 pages, but it's very erotic. From the first time Kasey and Gram have a very intense relationship and they are driven by lust most of the time. Since Kasey is a 23 years old guy that for sometime was deprived of a sexual partner, I think it's not strange that now that he can have someone near him, he is in frenzy to make up for the lost time. Plus it was a true discovery that Kasey is a totally bottom. I'm used to sports characters to be always very manly, even if gay, and usually they are totally top. Instead Kasey wants to be mastered, even if he is a pushy bottom.

I liked Angel's Pawn and loved Singh's new and original world.

I really enjoyed the book, which is based on Ann Hoods own story of the loss of her child and the group of women she befriends at the knitting circle in an attempt to save her life. Each woman has their own story of loss and survival and this provides the inspirational factor in an otherwise sad story.

So, Living Dead Girl was disturbing. Was it the most disturbing book I read? No. Let's Go Play at the Adams still holds that spot. Did I want Living Dead Girl to be more disturbing? Hell no! It was disturbing enough. It's kind of hard to recommend this, though. If you think that you could deal with this kind of subject, then by all means read Living Dead Girl. It's an extremely powerful novel that should be read. But if you have a weak stomache, then steer clear.
I think besides the idealistic posturing, behind which there are no practicalities for how to bring about their "utopia". I mean who is to oversee that everyone does a certain job or where all products of production are directed, etc. etc.? There is very little of substance here. But then it's aimed at the 19th century working classes who, especially at this time, were very poorly educated, if at all, and so they wouldn't have the critical thinking to dissect the propaganda and lack of pragmatism that the manifesto contains, they would simply swallow the message of "bourgeois bad, working class good, we will make the working class have better living standards". Like a politician, all style, no substance.

Anyar is a really particular character, he is strong in his weakness. Anyar, as I said before, has not the soul of a warrior, he is more a lover. So, even if the reader sometime would have liked for him to be stronger, and more rebellious, it's not really something that would have gone with his character. Anyar conquers people not with a sword, but with liquid and imploring eyes, and his last sacrificial act is really in line with his character, making him a martyr.

Of course there are numerous misunderstandings, especially including George Westham.

"Alas, All Thinking" moves closer to the Golden Age style of SF; it is a story of ideas, not action, and the idea was an unusually pessimistic one for 1930s SF: a time-traveller visits the future and discovers that humanity has not progressed, but rather degenerated into helpless, huge-brained beings who do nothing but meditate on ideas that prove to be useless.

You could argue that this book is a romance of sorts. When Oscar falls in love, he falls hard, and he's willing to risk his life, more than once, for the woman he loves. I think we all have a little bit of Oscar within ourselves. Some of us are fat, others too skinny, others not good at sports. Even the seemingly gifted are self-conscious about something. Diaz also does strong women really well. Lola, Oscar's sister; his mother, Beli; La Inca, his mother's adopted mother, and even Ybon, the prostitute he falls in love with are all well-rounded, true-to life characters.
This book is definitely not for everyone. It's about a horrifying topic. But it's something that happens every single day. I think that is the message that Elizabeth Scott was trying to get across. This is happening right under our noses all the time. Do we look the other way? Do we not pay enough attention to the odd young girl and her "Dad" that live next door? That's really scary to think about. But that's what this book does. It makes you think.

In this story it has to do with a large inheritance gone awry over a minor detail.  It languishes in the courts for years frittering away the money in court costs and lawyer fees.  There are other stories that weave in and out of the main story.  This book is long and complex, so you need to pay attention.  Despite that, it has very likeable characters and is an enjoyable read.  Dickens' prose is amazing in this one.  What a guy!  I may re-visit this one again someday.  I suggest taking notes on new characters as they arise.  You may not see them again for a while in the story, though they have important roles.  I got confused with who was who now and then.

I think this should be listed more adult than young adult, but still found the book an interesting read.

Well, this book is every parent's nightmare. This book is for sure not for the faint at heart. There were parts that made me literally sick to my stomach. As a whole, this story is horrifying. Sad part is, this is a reality for some innocent children. This book has left what feels like a hole in the pit of my stomach. Yet I couldn't put it down and read it in one day.

5408	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	When I first started reading this romance, the guy in it seemed too superficial and uncaring to be interesting or likable. I guess that was part of his beast persona, because as I read further and learned more about him, he just seemed human and vulnerable.  I thought the author did a pretty good job of writing a modern Beauty and the Beast story.  It was nice too that the Beauty character in the story was a black woman with the beast being blonde, which makes a nice change from the cliche' ofblack men being with white blonde women.

So Mama Argeneau sets out to give Lissianna the perfect present - one sexy male tied up and waiting.  Well, Lissianna wants Mr. Right, not just Mr. Available.  She's tired of her vamp immortal life, and would like someone to share it with.  Lissianna has other problems, such as her fainting at the sight of blood, an annoying trait for a vampire.  For a Birthday gift, Mama has gone out and fetched Dr. Gregory Hewitt, used mind control to get him to tuck himself up in the trunk of her car, and now has him tied up nekkid on Lissianna's bed.

Ms. Bell does an excellent job of building sexual tension. I was enraptured by Gabe, who is clearly the dominate in his erotic dreams with Sarah. But Sarah manages to hold her own. Her submissiveness to him has its limits, even in his dreams, which surprises but doesn't disappoint him. He is disappointed, however, by her continued mistrust in him, though he is sensitive enough to recognize he is the one mostly at fault.

7559	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I was a little leery as the story opened. Why in the world would a family allow Bridgett to go off alone with an unknown man? That didn't ring true to me until I got further into the story as Bridgett's personality was revealed in more detail. It took a few chapters to really get into the story, but then it held me captive to the very end. The only real downside for me came in the final winding up scenes. Bridgett's and Ian's characters had been developed very well up to this point. Then came the dissapointing scenario. It was a stretch for me to buy Bridgett's quick acceptance of the idea that Ian did not love or want her in light of what had gone on before. This part of the story came across as a manufactured attempt to create  a little tension and did not work well for me. All the same, this was a very good, well written story and deserves four stars in my opinion.

Wolf Flight is an interesting second story in the Granite Lake Wolves series and while it is dynamically different than the first it is still a fun read. I have to say that I was not drawn in from the start as I was with the first in this series I still enjoyed it.  I love that the two characters care for each other but are each afraid to go too far as they are both hiding their wolf selves.  But, in the end sometimes you are meant to wait so that you will appreciate what you have.  I had fun reading Wolf Flight and think others will also.
Highly recommended for English wonks and learners.
"Shroud" is more than eye candy. It is an insightful gaze into the deepest recesses of what it means to be human. I must say I had a sinking feeling as I closed the book after finishing the final page, a feeling that told me I missed many of Banville's intricately crafted subplots. This thought was quickly followed by another: it doesn't matter if I missed some points of the story. What I got out of it was enough to justify a thousand times over the choice I made to read this gorgeous work of art.

But I digress. This novel is set in the summer of 1964, when Lily Melissa Owens, the fourteen-year-old, is a very effectively a white slave on her father's peach plantation. She has grown-up thinking she shot her mom (accidentally), and now all she has is a father, Terrance Ray Owens. For reason unexplained, she addresses him as T-Ray, and he punishes her by making her kneel on grits. The family has a house slave, Rosaleen, who is Lily's stand-in mom.

PLOT: Again, this is a novella in a genre known for keeping things simple. Not a big plot line here- but for what it is, it's well done. It is definitely more creative than most I've read and opens up a world of possibilities for future books. All told, brilliant execution through simplicity.
Some elements didn't work so well. I found the depiction of Italians and Italian-Americans to be a bit over-the-top. (I almost expected Chico Marx and Mr. Bacciagalupe to appear.) It was far from offensive, however, because (a) some of the stereotypes are quite true (I can attest to this as an Italian-American), and (b) these characters are generally presented in a good-natured way. My last nitpick has to do with the ending of the legal component of the case which I will not give away here.

8828	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I don't exactly know why but male pregnancy seems to be the bane of Gay Romance. I have even found a place where an editor pleaded her authors to not send submission of stories with male pregnancy since she was really tired of them... and I thought, how strange, in my experience I have not found so much of them. Well, this is probably due to the fact that I'm not a big fan of fantasy or sci-fiction, and so, obviously, I skim from the beginning the possibility to find them. But when it happened, actually they didn't bothered me, on the contrary, there are some series (like Space Opera by Stephanie Burke, when will she write the third book?) that I really like a lot. True, it's not easy to write them without falling in the mistake of having one of the male involved being merely a girl with male attributes, but well, that is the only way for a man to get pregnant!

The story is a wonderful balance between an intriguing plot and the hotter-than- a-Texas-summer sexual exploits of the hero and heroine. Both Taran and Lark have that quality that makes readers care about them as individuals and as a couple.  The author takes the standard werewolf scenario and shows readers a different view of pack dynamics as well as several variations on the "mating" experience.  She addresses many questions I've always had about the mating phenomena, and hopefully, she'll address them further in the book she is currently planning about Nick and TJ.  After being inundated with vampire tales, I'm looking forward to future sexy shifter stories about werewolves in love.

Nor was Chandler above putting a little social commentary in Marlowe's mouth. Reflections on such topics as that very real change after World War II in the kind of swarms that were heading west to populate the American Western shore night. The rise of the corner boys hanging, just hanging, around blasted storefronts, a few breaking off into the cranked up hot rod hell's highway night. The restless mobsters for broken back east looking to bake out in the southern California sun while taking over the vast crime markets. The wannabe starlets ready to settle for less than stardom for the right price. The old California money (the gold rush, gold coast, golden era money) befuddled by the all new waves coming in. And above all a strong sense of the rootlessness, the living in the moment, the grabbing while the grabbing was good mentality that offended old Marlowe's honor code.

5769	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I know I'm going to be odd man out because I'm giving this story a 5 star rating but let me tell you why. First off I found the character of Carrie Richardson refreshing and the storyline as many have said is a bit Cinderella-ish, but only in the way that Alexeis is mega wealthy and to all at first glance Carrie appears to be poor as a church mouse with the brains to match, but I like the fact that the author allowed us to believe that and fed us bits and pieces into Carrie's true character as the story progressed. I know there are enough reviewers who will say that Carrie was a bimbo or she was portrayed as such by the author, but what those who read it missed was that Carrie herself never believed herself to be stupid or inferior to Alexeis she was just not use to his lifestyle and she never spoke on topics that he and his friends were fluent in i.e. art, theater the whose who in their mega rich world and their goings on, because Carrie could honestly say she knew nothing about those things because her own world before meeting Alexeis revolved around science and research and her parents where both scholarly people whose lives were immersed in their lives as said scholars. I think its rather unfair to class her as a "bimbo" because she happen to meet someone who was willing to spoil her, although to be fair he was misguided in thinking she was two bricks short of a load in the intellect department, but the author did a good job of putting human error, flaw and prejudice on display. This book really gives meaning to the saying "Still waters run deep". It's a book that I personally enjoyed and lets be honest ladies we don't purchases these books for their "realism" its fantasy and a chance to escape a bit, so for those who keep harping that its "unrealistic" or "stupid" do yourselves a favor and stop spending your money on them or take them out from your local library or pick a different genre to read about. Happy Reading

To Do List was a new and fully anticipated experience for me. Lauren Dane is one of my favorite authors and I think this was the first totally contemporary romance that I have read written by her.  To Do List made me giggle simply because I COULD HAVE BEEN Belle.  Famous in my family for my lists, I so empathized with her need to be organized and loved how her quirkiness endeared her to Rafe. I simply loved Rafe because he loved Belle.  His patience with her, even when he was dying for her to come to grips with their relationship, was appealing to me and I just simply desired him for my very own.
The dialogue is superb and carries us into the story straight away, without any long stretches of narrative to be negotiated. As a result the pace is fast, but not so fast that we don't have time to look around us and find out about Izzy's life and how she sees her new home.
The book's title is a version of the well-known "network effect," familiar to the increasing numbers of us who are actively aware of the networked world in which we live and work. The principle is simple: the bigger the network, the more interconnections among its nodes (in this case, members), and thus the more powerful it becomes. As Facebook may already be the largest human network on Earth, we can only begin to speculate what it might become if and when it grows to the one or two billion members Zuckerberg envisions.

Then when I go to the other short stories that are suppose to be in chronological order, while they are about the same subject with the same people, they do not follow the same story. Each one started a completely new story, I wish it would go along with the story instead of jumping years at a time.

This is interesting to read and entertaining at some level, but try not to get attached to the story too much....
While some reviewers have felt that the work is derivative and therefore not original, I would disagree.  It is true that, as a genre piece, the story does follow a certain ... guideline, I guess is the best term ... to steer its plot.  However, I believe that Ms. Britain has admirably created a unique setting for her world and set into motion events that will spill over into the remaining books in the trilogy, providing a satisfactory reading experience for anyone who not only likes the specific genre, but anyone who enjoys a good book.

This book amazes me and during the time when I was reading this book I found myself totally indulged in it. I found it to be highly entertaining because it is a strange horror comedy in the tradition of Ghostbusters and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Kevin gave me very imaginative and great comedic horror novel that keeps me smiling on the edge of my seat at the same time and entertains me with his horror comedy stories. I am impressed a lot that the book Last Rites is very well written and really easy to understand.

It deserves five stars and I would not ever think of giving it less than that.  I LOVED IT.

8308	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	The story starts strong with a classic Noir set-up (woman walks into dive bar looking for her lost sister and gets a big dose of trouble), but doesn't proceed strongly from there.  The relationships between the characters are unclear.  Every character seems to be a stereotype of some sort.  The realism factor is missing.  The ending is unclear.  With a stronger editorial hand, the author could have had something here.  But it takes more than visits to dive bars, missing women in peril, and characters who live on the wrong side of the law to make a good Noir story.

Laura is a very stubborn and private woman. She has dark secrets that she keeps locked deep inside because she feels she must. There were times where I, along with Shane, was very frustrated with this heroine because she cannot give him her trust and refuses to confide in him. However, as the story progresses to its riveting conclusion, I came to understand and respect why she felt she had to keep her secrets so close, literally bricking up a thick wall around herself.
Perhaps I withheld five stars because, even after the crisis I think I would like a bit more story on Ky and Toby Vatta and SDF
The writing and descriptions were well-done and there was plenty of conflict. Though some of the characters expressed insights that helped to give them depth, I didn't feel a real connection with them. This may have been because there were so many characters involved. Still, I would like to have had a better feel for the main characters, particularly Gordon.

7272	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Anyone familiar with the Perils of Pauline era romance, this might appeal to you.  Story pacing is a bit jerky, and it starts slow, but as the story progresses it gets more laughable.  The hero and heroine are meant to be likeable, and they are, for paper doll figures.  The lesser characters are more developed, but none of them are very believable. If you're paying money, don't waste any on 'Romancing Adrienne.'
I am seriously going to have to quit reading certain categories of novel - novels which have titles like The Mermaid Chair and The invention of Wings. Anything which won a 'medal' is out. Medals are for heroes. I see nothing heroic and everything formulaic about the bulk of such pretentious novels. What else can we ditch? Well, anything which includes a female name in the title (with few exceptions), such as An Abundance of Katherines, and especially if the name does double duty, such as Looking for Alaska. Anything which includes 'dreams' or 'stars' in the title, such as The Fault in Our Stars. Anything which uses a bad or sad and weak metaphor, such as Paper Towns.

I enjoyed this book very much and intend to find more Georgette Heyer books.
Tad doesn't realize he is an Omega, just recently found out he is a wolf, and is conflicted about being "triggered" so that he can take his wolf form.  His reasons are complicated, and somewhat justified, even when he is reunited with his high school love....Missy, whom he has been secretly yearning for.  I wanted Tad to claim Missy as a true Alpha would...no matter the consequences, and even though he yearns to do exactly that...he won't let himself, it goes against everything that he is as a character.  I wanted Tad to take what he wanted, because it's what Missy wants too.  For me he was too conflicted, not assertive enough...and basically just not an Alpha.  And that is where I think the problem lies for me.  It's not that his character was not written well, because it was.  The author stayed true to what being an Omega male should be...unfortunately I've come to realize that I prefer Alpha's...and even Beta's, but not so much an Omega for a hero.
2795	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	A young adult fantasy, Wildwood Dancing by Juliet Marillier is quite simply, delicious. It is part historical fiction, part romance, part mystery, part fantasy and completely magical. The prose is beautiful, the plot is captivating and the characters are drawn so precisely that your imagination is like a camera capturing the essence of the author's ideas.
To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, "Vegas Show Girl Murders," and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get "Vegas" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.

8929	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I heard wonderful things about Georgette Heyer and decided to give one of her novels a whirl.  I heard Heyer wrote mostly Regency romances, so I was surprised to see that this one is actually a Georgian romance.  I am not a big fan of the Georgian period because I don't like the elaborate clothing and I have a difficult time picturing men wearing powdered wigs, tights and corsets, but The Convenient Marriage is one of the most endearing and most hilarious period pieces I have ever read!  Heyer had me in stitches during some scenes.  The Earl of Rule feels it is time to get married and asks for society darling Lizzie Winwood's hand in marriage.  Lizzie isn't interested in Lord Rule. She does want to marry a wealthy man, but she also wants to be in love with whoever she decides to marry. So her sister Horatia (Horry) takes her place.  Horry isn't your typical heroine.  She has a very bad stutter, is plain in appearance and has a rather particular sense of humor.  Will those qualities endear her to Lord Rule or will he run a mile?  There are many hilarious twists throughout the novel.
As it turns out, the formatting of this book in the Kindle format leaves much to be desired, and makes it quite unusable either as a reference in the store or a cookbook in the kitchen.

But, is she really losing her mind or is it something she will have to learn to live with? This is just the beginning of uncovering a deep family secret.
- Even though Remi is depicted in Without Reservations as a total jerk, this book not only explains his bad attitude enough to make him sympathetic but also develops him (with the help of the right partner and a loving relationship, of course) into a character I genuinely admired by about a quarter of the way through the story.
Ms. Scottoline does a magnificent juggling act here. Unlike most mysteries or courtroom dramas which focus on a handful of developed characters and bring in dozens of marginally described minor characters, this book is crowded with believable, three dimensional people. Besides the three women in Rosato's firm, there are the defendant and her fellow inmates; there's Rosato's boyfriend, Grady; there's a cabal of individually motivated crooked cops; there's the judge; the D.A.; a hotheaded prizefighter... the list goes on.

If one is looking to fault Marx's economics based on the works of Capital, one will come up empty not only because Marx's logic is flawless, but as economist and former Marxist Thomas Sowell says, " ...Marx considered the idea of proving a concept to be ridiculous.

The author has a wonderful ability to put her readers right between the pages of the book.  In addition the narrative evokes the language and society of the 1900's.

A cold distance overlays the minor characters in this, befitting the winter setting, but not making for an enjoyable read, at least not for me. Daniel's parents are unable to love him as he is, or even at all, Daniel's brother is estranged, and Daniel's present partner can't reach his cold and ungenerous boyfriend. Mitchell chucks Ginny into the mix - a lesbian schoolfriend who supposedly taps into Daniel's sensitive side and gives him a righteous kick in the arse - but because of Daniel's lack of warmth and depth, and because he doesn't care enough about Ginny to actually keep in contact with her, the relationship feels false to me, claiming too great an intimacy on too little knowledge.

And despite the fact that Abagnale is a shameless womanizer (a fact he makes clear throughout the book) and scammed hundreds of businesses in dozens of countires out of millions of dollars, you can't but help like him.

None of the works is really a classic mystery in the sense the reader could intuit the outcome.  Instead, the stories focus on the dark, tough-guy sphere of the Los Angeles underworld.  Virtually everyone over the age of 18 smokes, drinks, and carries a gun, and there's nobody under 18.  Eventually a reader gets the view poking a loaded gun into someone's chest was the canonical salutatory gesture of the early 1930's, only later replaced by the handshake.  And it's slightly disturbing how the racism of the time is embedded into virtually all of the stories here.
Typically people criticize Dave's advice on two points. First, he gets flak because he claims you can get a 12% return on your retirement investments in mutual funds. I think people who complain about the number 12 aren't looking long-term enough. But, even if the 12 is overly optimistic, Dave's point, which is unquestionable, is that you'd be a fool to put your retirement moneys anywhere else. Second, He gets complaints because he mocks the FICO score. People point out that with no FICO score you may end up paying more for certain insurances or for home mortgages. This criticism is only partly true. Not all companies rely on the FICO, and you don't have to do business with those that do. You can get affordable car insurance from a number of national, reputable companies that don't even check your FICO score. As for the home mortgage, if you have a 20% down payment (which is the minimum Dave recommends), you will find a good interest rate from a bank. Just shop around. Local banks tend to rely on scores less because they can see you face to face.
If you're looking for a mad race to the finish, with red herrings, carefully placed clues, and subplots galore, you'll probably want to skip over this read. But if you're looking for a mystery that ages like a fine wine, and only gets better as you move at a slow, steady pace toward the end, with characters so real that you can feel their breath whispering against your ear, you'll want to race to the bookstore and grab this mystery, if you haven't already done so.

Some reviews here complain about the lingo but I did not find the medical bits distracting at all.  The professional lives of these characters define them and give the story a strong sense of place.  This book was a freebie but I definitely would have paid for it.

At one point the narrator says that all big families are the same. Enright has made the Hegartys (she has a dozen ways to desribe the blue of their eyes) symbolic of every large family: those the parents favored, those they didn't, the messers (Liam), the drunks, the most successful, the religious one, the mysterious one, the brightest. This family calls to mind another large family in Thomas Wolfe's 1939 novel LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL. The narrative, as the Queen would say in Alan Bennett's recent novel THE UNCOMMON READER, does not progress as the crow flies but rather meanders in and out among three generations of this crazed and in some ways doomed family.

There's no slow buildup.  You're thrown right into Alice's hell.  It's an interesting choice.  We see the kidnapping and glimpses of the past several years in flashback chapters, but not directly.

It also allows us to come in at Alice's worst moment: the moment Ray says he has a new plan for her.  This plan, to steal another child, is horrifying in itself, and a clever literary choice.  It shows us just how broken Alice is mentally--so desperate for freedom from her abuse that she'll do anything to remove Ray's attention from her.  The ending is abrupt, but I don't think it would have been good for it to drag either.

Halt and Horace have arrived in Skandia to rescue Will and Evanlyn from slavery only to be trapped there by the advancing forces of the Temujai.  Fortunately the Oberjarl recognizes that Halt's knowledge of strategy may be useful and allows our heroes to stay in Hallosholm and prepare for battle.

Unlike many other haters of this tedious book, I didn't find it particularly difficult reading. The unannounced shifts back and forth in time and place didn't leave me adrift so much as amazed at their clumsiness. Then again, the book is essentially a monologue of remembrance, and human memories are messy things, so I was willing to conditionally accept that messiness as part and parcel of the protagonist. Speaking of the protagonist (middle-aged Veronica Hegerty), many haters seem to focus on her unlikability as the source of the book's problems. Personally, I don't think that a protagonist needs to be likable in any way -- just interesting. But she's not interesting in the slightest, just (like the book itself), annoyingly self-indulgent. I suppose this could be construed as a kind of commentary on her yuppiesh generation, but that seems like grasping at straws. Moreover, there are no other characters to connect with. The entire story takes place within Veronica's head, and even though it's populated with various family members who allegedly mean so much to her (in a love/hate way), the reader never gets a sense of any of them.
1308	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This book should of almost been called, "the Brief Wondrous Lineage of Oscar Wao", since much of the book is filled not just with his story, but also his Mother's, Sisters, and Grandfather. An obscenely overweight Dominican sci-fi geek growing up in New Jersey Wao's story is one of a family cursed by what is known as the fuka. How this manifests itself in the life of of present day hero though, is revealed through that family's past; A past ripe with violence, will, and most importantly, love. The book is strewn with fantasy sci-fi references and passages in Spanish without the aid of translation, so there were snippets that were lost to me. Footnotes also are scattered throughout the book that are used as a history lesson mostly to educate the reader about the brutal thirty year reign of dictator Rafael Trujillo, and the ripple effect on Oscar's family. It's powerful writing, that's both laugh out loud funny at times,and also shocking in it's brutality. My one regret is that I don't speak Spanish.
I liked Containment, so I decided to try another story by Cantrell. I was not disappointed.



The Vampire's Bride focuses on Layel, king of the vampires, and Delilah, an Amazon warrior. However, we are introduced to many other characters, including Zane & Nola. I was happy to find out how their story ended.

There are not many books that I put aside with the idea that someday I might read them again.  This; however, is one of those that belong to the just might category.  It's just that good!

When the year was up he wrote three mysteries of his own and had such amazing success that he spent the rest of his life continuing the series.

Silhouette novels were always a favorite of mine in my youthful days, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why I gave them up, especially, after reading STONE COLD SURRENDER.  Brenda Jackson is a great romance writer.  Montana is not the most romantic place that I can think of, but add a couple of sensual individuals and Ms. Jackson's writing abilities and you have a wonderful and heartwarming love story that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling all over.

The writing in this book surprised me - the only other book I've read by Elizabeth Scott is Love You Hate You Miss You, and while the writing in both of these was good, it's completely different. The writing in this novel is poetic, simplistic and beautiful, and that's not at all what I would have expected after Love You Hate You Miss You, in which the writing was much more descriptive. Maybe this story needed such a simple style, though - none of the really disturbing parts are described, and the reader has to imagine all the terrible details, which I think makes this book even more powerful.
Karigan is a fantastic heroine; shes plucky, intelligent, and loyal.  She has a very stubborn and headstrong way of dealing with things, which can be a negative thing, but often causes the reader to just chuckle at the situations she gets herself in.  Instead of bestowing a name for the horse she inherited (since the Rider never told her), she insists on calling him Horse.  Horses intelligence and uncanny ability to predict danger, not to mention not listening to a word Karigan says, will have you falling in love with him.  The story mainly focusses on Karigan, but the supporting characters are fantastic, especially the Berry SistersMiss Mayberry and Miss Bunchberryand their eclectic, magical house.  The world building was very well done, particularly the magical abilities inherited by the Green Riders.

Charles has also inherited a few gifts of his own. Although his father, Bran, is a Welshman, his mother was Salish. When she became pregnant after the Change, her father who possessed magical abilities helped her to stay human so that she could carry the baby to full-term. Charles' mother did not survive childbirth because she was so weak from resisting the Change each month with the full moon. Charles was born a werewolf; he was not Changed. This has given him a few extra magical talents, such as having the ability to Change quickly.
I know she had to get into the woods to fulfil the story but getting drunk, deliberately running out in the middle of the night and getting chased by The Beast was just plain silly. It was reminiscent of those old-time movies where the "feisty" girl reporter is told not to go into the cellar and of course, the first thing she does is just that. Izzy, told not to go into the woods by just about everyone she meets, does just that too.
I started off reading these just because of the upcoming television series, but now I love them only for their own sake.

First, let me say please don't judge a book by it's title, because I think this title is absolutely horrible, though the story itself is a great read (am also not crazy about these photo covers that EC uses a lot). The main characters are likable, the chemistry between them leaps off of the page, there is some surprisingly good humor, and the book is well-written.

"With Caution" is a fine complement to "Without Reservation". The main characters of Remi and Jake were introduced in that novel, and in this one, we get to see them mature and step into their new roles. J. L. Langley manages to mix excitement, danger, and eroticism all seamlessly, adding in a bit of humor when needed. It's enthralling to see Remi faced with pure lust and attraction for Jake, but not understanding why since he's straight. We spend quite a bit of time in Remi's head, and we learn his motivations and empathize with him. Jake is also a complex character in a difficult situation. He knows Remi is his mate, and the attraction is just as strong for him as it is for Remi. Jake is also a very dominant Alpha, and his first instinct is to throw Remi down and make him submit, but such an act on the unready Remi will merely scare him away. Jake walks a fine line between staying near enough to Remi to gain his trust, but still keep his arousal and instincts under control.
Oh yah, about Raymond Chandler, about the guy who wrote the book.

Marillier's writing is rich and vivid, immediately transporting readers to the world of Jena (the narrator) and her sisters.

Craig Johnson writes with a great deal of detail and this certainly isn't a fast-paced page turner. But it is an intriguing indepth look at the characters and the rugged area where they live. I liked that the story had a bit of the spiritual and supernatural, especially when Longmire was in rescue mode. The Cold Dish isn't for the faint of heart, but delivers a powerful story that is not only difficult to put down, but to forget after the last page is read. Johnson is a top-notch author and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.

Aislinn is quite the main protagonist. She's tenacious and bold, beautiful and strong.

Having seen `their' cougar for days without the pretty feline coming any closer, Jericho and Hunter are surprised when she finally gets close enough to them for them to touch her.  Realizing she is exhausted and hurt, they bring her inside.

They have no idea the woman they are seeing is the cougar they have been slipping food to for months.

It made me question what the definition of law enforcement's mantra of "doing our best".  If I was a parent of a missing child, and knowing the horrible things that may happen to them in the hands of their captor, I would expect the people working on the case to be working non-stop 24/7.  Of course, that's not realistic.  I felt for Steven too, his conflict with the responsibilities of his work and his family but was often quite frustrated at him as I felt that at times he wasn't doing enough, especially when he was distracted with Jenna.

I read some reviews where people were bashing the book because they were appalled about the threesome issue. It clearly stated in the description of the book that that was what this was. I knew what to expect and so should they if they bothered to read the description. It was very well written and the characters were people that seemed like real people you would want to be friends with. I really liked the fact that the men were geeks in high school and now were good looking and still wanted the girl they did in high school. Most of us were geeks in high school and would love to find out that someone they knew and may have liked as well had also liked them.

But, as you read further, suicide is not only a depressing concept to this family, but is the main reason for the family gathering at the brother Liam's wake.  And, as the large family congregates for the wake, she realizes that the family has cliques and more within its foundation. "We do not always like the people we love - we do not always have that choice." "We are born to love the people we otherwise would not care to know."

MacGuire and Trevor ultimately find themselves in a race against time and distance as they leave safety and security to bring the battle home --- and to hopefully solve the mystery of Cira's treasure.

If you have read even the first book in the Soul Screamers series, there are little things to notice in the novella.

Several of these discoveries are generally familiar to us from newspapers, like Tutankhamen (Tut) Tomb, Machu Picchu, the Rosetta Sone, Pompeii, and Troy.  Others are vaguely familiar like Akrotiri, Nineveh, Leakys work, the tomb of 10,000.  Interestingly, several of the most famous archeological events were discovered accidentally - pure serendipity!  Others required much effort and extensive spending .  It is difficult to discuss all of them here but two stand out as very significant. Take the Rosetta Stone, which was accidentally discovered by Napoleons forces while cleaning the Nile river in 1799.  The writing on this stone enabled the deciphering of the hieroglyphic language thus opening up the ancient history of the Egyptians which was a mystery for 2000 years. But Tuts tomb was considered  the greatest discovery of the 20th Century and also the most rewarding. In a US tour in 1976 it attracted over 8 million visitors and brought over $100 million in income.

When I was a kid, I had a book called "One Minute Mysteries" that I loved. It had short mysteries that had clues in them. At the end of each one, the detective would state that he had solved the crime, then the book would ask something like, "How did he know?" The reader could try to figure it out, then turn the page for the answer. There are four stories in this format included in this collection. I have to admit that I was only able to 'solve' two of them.  This author showed tremendous talent in his ability to weave intelligent mysteries.

Concepts from quantum physics are not easy to comprehend, especially if the reader doesn't have some background in science. Furthermore, these ideas present a different world view from that of Descartes and Newton, and there are many scientists (and some reviewers obviously!) who are stuck in this classical reductionist, materialist world-view and who refuse to accept that there is evidence of phenomena that simply cannot be explained with these principles. I am a scientist who has used quantum concepts in my research, and I do not `belong' to any religion: so I have no preconceived beliefs to distort my assessment of the facts. The personal stories that McTaggart tells here are not irrelevant, as one reviewer suggested - they put a human face to scientists who are thought by many to be without emotions because their work must necessarily be objective.

Hold the Dark is definitely the longest and most enjoyable of the three Markhat stories.  I added the "sort of" qualifier in the review title because it ticks me off when publishers (I assume they make this decision) add excerpts from other works at the end of a Kindle edition.  Since Kindle edition works have no page numbers, readers use a percentage display to gauge how much of a work they've read.  Hold the Dark ends at 89% of the Kindle document and the last 11% is excerpts from the other two Markhat works, which is ridiculous because they are really just short stories, and from a work by some other author presumably from the same publisher.

  The author's metaphysical description of unseen forces in the universe are interesting, and certainly easy to understand and think about, whether or not those forces actually exist in the form the author presents.  It is easy to treat that analysis as an analogy,  it is a good framework for things no one has successfully fully descibed or proven.  One's own experience in applying the author's principles for action will undoubtedly give results that will conform to the expected outcomes suggested by the philosophical framework presented by the author.
While this first installment in the series does seem to have a story problem that is resolved (find the wielder) it isn't the main character's problem. His problem is feeling like an outcast in his home reality and I guess that is resolved in the story. It seems pretty easily resolved to me. The plot is strong for the story but the character arc is weak.

In fact, and unknown to Ricardian economists or Marx, industrial Capitalism could not have emerged without the conscious decision of nations to allow for the rise of interest rates to free market heights, abandoning low interest rates policies, such low interest rates policies making possible the Mercantilist pre-industrial Capitalist era. Only with higher, market-based interest rates is it possible to accumulate the necessary large quantities of capital for industrial enterprise.

The author's research is detailed in the "Author's Note", "Bibliography" and "With Gratitude" sections at the end of the novel.  These sections are not to be missed or the reader will miss very important elements in the quality of presentation tucked between the covers of this book that is now preserved for generations to come. It uniquely describes the past strife of the Civil War, uniquely honors the courage of a soldier in battle, and the human spirit of 'ordinary' individuals that become extraordinary not due to any oratory display or written document in the midst of war but through the simple actions of humanity during their everyday lives that speak louder than any words spoken or written. The story touched my heart and I hope I will always remember the depth of emotions as I closed the back cover.

Her relationship with one of the city's many prostitutes illustrates the desperation of some women who are on their own, and how close she herself is to the dividing line between them.

It's not "hard" sci fi, but it does have a lot of well researched mathematics in it, enough to keep a hard sci fi fan happy. To a previous reviewer who commented about global warming being real and the U.S. being the bad guy, I didn't get that at all from the book. Yes, it was mentioned that global warming turned out to be real, and that the U.S. had to spend lots of money to get it under control, but I don't think the author was preaching on either subject. It was simply a (very small) part of the storyline. In fact, so far, it has been mentioned only once. I recommend this book to any sci fi fan!

Overall a very well done addition to this series.  Wraps up the story arc that started in The Burning Bridge nicely.

Justice is secondary to, if not in conflict with, loyalty to the client. As the novel progresses, however, Bennie finds her own advice hard to swallow because the client, who may or may not be her identical twin that she never knew existed, is a devious and dangerous woman, accused of murdering a policeman. Later in the book, one of Bennie's legal associates, takes boxing lessons. The advice given to her by her trainer is that if you punish the body long enough, the head will fall. This advice goes further than anyone involved in the case would have imagined. Punishing the prosecutor's case, and dogged investigation, would bring justice while maintaining loyalty--to a degree. To me, these were the central points of this tense and intense novel.

The Flaws: While the stories are fun this book could very well be considered a filler by most standards of fantasy series. The plot does not really advance in that there is still no resolution to the crisis that had started with The Burning Bridge. Its more of a setup for the fourth volume in the series. The character development is really what pulls the book through but the story is lacking somewhat.

Scott has certainly grown up right, now running his own business and enjoying life almost to the fullest.  The only thing missing in his life is love.  Sure, his looks pave the way for him with most women, but many regard him as nothing more than a curious fling due to his blindness.  Tara is one of the few women that treats him just like any other man, which he most certainly is.

The author could have taken a better tact in concluding the story.  The author writes, We still revel in Wild West literature, but there is little of the wild left in the West of to-day, little of the old lawlessness.  There was still plenty left of the wild, but American society just decided that desperadoes would not be tolerated anymore.  The posses to catch desperadoes were relentless.  Such a scene was described in the movie, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, where the two outlaws hope that  they have finally broken free of the chase, only to hear the pounding of hoofs in the background.

Much of the story unfolds as Walt's internal dialog.  This works well in audio book format.  Walt rambles from the present, to supporting detail, to connected memories from the past.  The dialog loops back to the main narrative often enough to tie things together.  The effect is like watching a picture emerge as a pencil is moved rapidly back and forth on a paper that covers a carved pattern.  The eye first tries to follow the pencil, then loses awareness of it and watches the emergence of the picture.  It is a skillfully-achieved effect.  Good writing.

At one point the narrator says that all big families are the same. Enright has made the Hegartys (she has a dozen ways to desribe the blue of their eyes) symbolic of every large family: those the parents favored, those they didn't, the messers (Liam), the drunks, the most successful, the religious one, the mysterious one, the brightest. This family calls to mind another large family in Thomas Wolfe's 1939 novel LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL. The narrative, as the Queen would say in Alan Bennett's recent novel THE UNCOMMON READER, does not progress as the crow flies but rather meanders in and out among three generations of this crazed and in some ways doomed family.

If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.  In order, they are:
 Her whole life she has dreamed of living in England and meeting a man similar to John Cleese. In an attempt to start breaking away from her boss who is threatening her with a lawsuit, she flies to England to meet Nigel Channing, who has been charming her through e-mails and phone calls.

After reading the novels synopsis, I expected more emotions and more energy to occur within its pages but after reading it, I felt that the novel had more of an even tone and I have mixed feeling about this.

This is the only point in the story where I have to stop and consider if something like that would conceivably really happen. Naturally, we are talking about time travel so some suspension of disbelief is necessary no matter what. But strangely I find this "selling one's face for money" scheme the hardest to believe. I don't care how down on her luck someone is. Or how much some ugly woman would like to have someone else's face. I have actually been through an organ transplant myself a few years back and there isn't enough money that would make me want to repeat the experience. A face transplant would carry very similar pain and suffering and it would always make someone look like a freak. Both donor and recipient.

No one ever stares - they universally stare coldly or hotly, and both words are apparently interchangeable to the author.

When she's threatened, Jackson and Shayne help her out.  She has feelings for them right away, and she begins the agreed duties of cooking their meals.  Their relationship moves fast, but it's great.  I loved the way she was with Shayne, and how she handled the situation after the attack.

How and why will she change? Or will she? That is the main issue but the various subplots are what make this book a special treat. Horowitz throws in little gems of insight, much as Austen did. This book will make you think about society's conventions - or perhaps make you wonder about the loss of them.

I actually don't read a G.A. Hauser to have a true and accurate book on gay life, I read one of her books for the glitter of the show business, for the hotness of cops in uniform, for reading of a man that is unsteady and emotional like and more than a woman, who makes mistake, and cries, and in all his craziness, can admit that he is a wrench, but his man loves him all the same, or maybe right for that reason.

Fearful of discovery, vampires no longer feed "off the hoof" but instead use blood banks to survive. Lissianna however is hemophobic which means she needs to either be fed blood intravenously or find victims she can feed off directly. Lissianna tries to combine her interest in social work with finding food and so works at a local shelter. She is affected by the blood she drinks so consuming the blood of a drunk or ill person affects her negatively. While the interactions between Lissianna and Greg were fun, they were not really deep and meaningful. I thought that Greg was far too calm and rational when he found out that vampires were real and got on the `vampires are cool' bandwagon way too fast. For a psychologist he is fairly shallow - when he's tied to a bed in a strange house with a bladder that is about to burst he thinks that it would be great to be a sex slave for someone like Lissianna. Come on. Despite this, I loved the fact that life mates were unable to read each other's minds or control each other. This offered the chance for a true partnership rather than having one dominate over the other.

I know there was a subtle element of religion in the original P&P, but the story, Assumed Engagement, hits you over the head with it.  Many pages were taken up by sermons that were unnecessary to the story continuity.  The other part of the book that was strange was Darcy's pressing need to build a school for the deaf.

The 1800s provided many great works of political thought; few of which can compare in importance as this short tract by Karl Marx.  Along with Das Kapital, this was one of the first major works in human history to link economics with sociology and political institutions, this text has done for economic liberty and equality what the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence has done for political liberty and equality.  Written by Marx as part propaganda to invoke change, and part retribution to his enemies; intellectual and otherwise, this book has inspired political movements ever since.

I do have to complain to the author about his calling or describing 60-year old characters as elderly, wrinkled, etc.  As an energetic, active 60-year old, every time I saw one of these descriptions, I laughingly harumped and said to myself, this author must be very young to think of 60-year olds in this manner.  In all, you get a couple of days of light entertainment for only 99 cents.
This novel has some of the fantastic world-building I expect of Marillier, but lacks the historical detail I would have appreciated.

She makes this clear in the opening sentence: "I would like to write down what happened in my grandmother's house the summer I was eight or nine, but I am not sure if it really did happen." Or sort of clear; her doubts about the past are part of the point.

The novel is more actions and a slow build up to the love scenes and I really enjoyed that part.  My problem with this novel is that I was very much wishing that this was just a start to a series and that there were other books because I really want to read more about Wulf's brothers finding their mates.  As of yet, I have not found any more in the series but I'm still looking.

Markhat is a 'finder', Tuttle-speak for Private Eye. He's also a smart aleck and as entertaining as protaganists get. The book is short, but that's okay, there are three more to read, soon to be four.

The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Destiny-s-Way-Star-Wars-The-New-Jedi-Order-Book-14/dp/0345428749/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Destiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14)</a>, which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author.

What I loved so much about this book was that it explored the MMF menage a trois relationship in a realistic way that made it very believable.  I loved how the sex was anything but formulaic... I was surprised by how creative Liz Andrews was in the love scenes.  They were HOT and downright mouthwatering!  I also enjoyed the character development between all three of them.  It felt like such a complete book... so well done!  I also want to note that I was really, truly pleased with Stephanie's character... Andrews could have made her extremely annoying or obnoxious but she handled her character well with humor but also with grace.  I was really grateful for that.

Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade.

Aspect of Crow Trilogy: Eyes of Crow, Voice of Crow and The Reawakened.
Whether due to the limiting nature of the length of the story (it's quite short) or due to my admitted lack of true enchantment with menage relationships (it has to be exceptionally well written menage for me to enjoy it - and I've read them), I found Taken to be rushed and harried at the beginning, and a bit drawn out and tedious towards the end. I saw some promise in Caleb and Van, but wasn't at all fond of Anne through the whole of the story. I'm not really sure why, but she got on my nerves, I'm sorry to say. I thought the strongest parts of the story were from Caleb and Van's perspectives and unfortunately, most of the story was from Anne's. Still, points for originality of idea. I'm still a fan of Bast.

It is not a safe world, sadly and there are sickos like Ray out there. I like how the book is honest and doesn't sugarcoat it. This book was really direct and though it was short it did leave me satisfied. I don't understand why it was a hardcover, when it was under 200 pages.

And boy oh boy does this book have sharp elbows. It is a bitter little pill of a novel. Just like its main character, it resists sympathy and identification. Enright uses fantasy, disjointed narrative, unpleasant people doing unpleasant things-- pretty much every device that you can imagine to force the reader back outside the text. It makes for such a strange combination because she writes with such lyrical prose and such a delicate hand that you expect to find the book yielding. The contrast is very interesting, but in the end I am not sure how successful The Gathering really is-- largely for that reason.
I don't recommend it, at least to those outside the San Francisco metro area.

Yes, there are quite a few predictable elements, but Britain's style is enjoyable, descriptive, and leads you from one page to the next - no dragger here!  It reminds me of some of the best fantasy I've read with a  Tolkienesqe quality - plenty of behind the scenes history that could be  explored with a heroine of some quality.  I hope that Ms. Britain is up to  the task of doing it. I look forward to a sequel.  The typos complained of  in the hard cover I did not notice in the paperback.  If you're a critic,  you'll probably not like this book - it is somewhat formulaic (ie, good  does triumph over the bad, and truly new fantasy character types are hard  to come up with), and the descriptive overkill that some critics seem to  like is absent.  I recommend this to any reader over 13; it has some  violence, none of the obligatory sex scenes, some romance, and colorful but  tasteful dialogue. This is Entertainment!

One night while they were fighting they came across a group of human fighters and decided to join forces with them. Among them was a soldier named Kate to whom both found themselves attracted.

I would've thought it was a joke save for the sex scenes which though graphic were anything but sexy or even accidentally humorous. The characters seemed to be placed in the plot merely to execute a series of not very imaginative sex positions with no relation at all to their station in life or the time period they are meant to be living in let alone any kind of inner life or even surface life. Skip it!
The hardest thing about finishing a book you love is saying goodbye to the characters. Thankfully, that's not a big issue with Allison Brennan's books because they continue to turn up in future books. It allows you a peek into how their lives keep progressing past their own book. I'm especially happy when member of the Kincaide family pop up as well as Hans Vigo, the FBI profiler. I'm really hoping he gets his own book soon with his true love story. He may be older but love knows no age, right? Speaking of age, I'm also happy that the main characters  in these books are not all 22 but in their 30's and 40's.

This is a fully workable translation of the Old and New Testaments and the searching feature works very well, provided that you follow the instructions.

The author apparently doesn't have the faintest idea what commas are for, because they are used when they shouldn't be and are unfortunately lacking where they should be.  Lack of commas results in run-on sentences that defy translation.  Errors like "could of" instead of "could've" or "could have" are frequent, and the writing style is amateurish and annoying.

It is eccentric and fun, true to the spirit and animals of the original manuscript. The author says it might as accurately be called "The Book of Cats". The reader is caught up in awe, passion, factual details, history, perspective and appreciation of "the greatest relic of Western civilization". I learned a lot and enjoyed each of Worrall's words, except for one regrettable spelling error. He predicts the swirling lines and characters of Celtic calligraphy and iconography may replace the straight lines of infrastructures and roads of our society's Roman tradition.

It's not only that he explores the vast reaches of the English vocabulary but that every description or action is conveyed in a highly disciplined prose and laser-precise diction. Wisehart loves words and the reader revels in the language that compels one to follow William of Ockham, Giovanni Boccaccio, Nadja and Marco da Roma, the last Knight Templar into the bowels of Hell and the fate that awaits them there. The history -- Ockham, Boccaccio, Petrarch are all real historical figures along with assorted churchmen who appear -- and the fantasy are rendered with equal authority.

Despite Veronica's problems and Liam's, this history of the Hegarty family is a counterpoint to the success story of Ireland during the past decades, as it has emerged from its backwater to become one of the leading engines of the new Europe.

So much is wrong with this book, yet I stayed with it until the end. Even though the dialogue was off and the author didn't convince me the time period was 1835 London, I loved the characters and the mystery behind them. It was a painful page-turner, because some of those passages were painful to read. Yet, I couldn't stop if I wanted to.
That's why I like this book a lot -- it's a really good mix of writing ingredients, from a compelling story that you want to come out a certain way, to really good characterizations of people easy to like, with plenty of suspense and humor thrown in to really entertain throughout.  I was also pleased that some of the lapses into very implausible action (lawyers tailing criminal's cars, or fighting against their own clients) that characterized some of the earlier works in this series was finally absent from the book at hand.  Lastly, I keep hearing (I guess from the publisher's blurbs) that Lisa's books are being used for classroom debate, and I suspect this one will as well, if the legal "mores" angle interests you.
The pacing is a bit slow as far as the action goes, its clear Moon is more interested in character development and starting the building of her world here than anything else. I was never precisely bored, but there are stretches that are less action packed than others. I also suspect that there might have been a larger book here that Moon decided to trim. Some subplots and ideas are mentioned and dropped in, but not fully explored. This may be a case of Chekov's Law, as applied to subsequent novels.
It is also unforgettable because it is a textbook example of how fragile and tenuous the moral fabric of our society can be. It shows for instance how "tolerated" inner city corruption can be "gamed" and "played" by two determined brothers and then used to take over the rest of a large urban city. Whitey Bulger became an FBI informant at an early stage of his criminal career, but then quickly realized that his FBI handlers were equally vulnerable to the same kind of immorality they expected and extracted from him as their "resident stooge." And just as they had captured and "turned him," he slowly reeled them in and "turned them in reverse." And they became "the bigger fish" without ever realizing what had happened to them. This small "reverse advantage," greatly assisted by strategic murders, FBI and police corruption, was soon parlayed into a incestuously corrupt web in which Whitey's informants, his FBI handlers, were "running interference" for the Boston crime wave engineered by Whitey himself.
7888	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This book offers a unique combination of fantasy and detective novel. The main character is likable, and the pacing and narrative voice are handled well.

Other than that, I found this to be enjoyable, and I look forward to reading more books in this series.

The prose is incredulously lyrical, rich, and refined - so much more compressed and yet detailed any prose in most contemporary fiction. Banville is one of the few living author who can maintain the flow of a novel with a taut sense while flourishing different themes as well as exploring and exposing, delineating the intricacies of human emotions. The book leaves us in awe of the marvelous silence with which human tolerate lies. Once again Banville has epitomized literary fiction with a twisting intrigue, which is unfortunately exiguous in the market now.

While Sowell is indeed correct that Marx and Engles viewed the unfolding of history as a "dialectical conception of reciprocal interaction", that observation does not answer the question: What comes first? The machinery, or new social relations, derived from machines, that interacts with the old social relations to produce the new hybrid social relations? Marx was emphatic that machines came first, then all else followed them. In his retort to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's observation that the use of machines was a consequence of the division of labor,(5) Marx writes:

While Collie, is truly trying to find his place in life, he clearly needs the support of family to help him find his way...something he never seems to find. The true weakness of this story is that the characters are too quirky to be believable (at least for me), and that the story lacks a sense of focus. It seems to move all over the place without satisfactory closure. Despite this there were some humorous scenes that made my struggle with this book a bit more bearable.

I remain surprised that it won the Man Booker Prize. I took a look at the reviews on Amazon, and am not shocked to find them universally savage. An Irish female writer dealing with the subject of a dysfunctional family has a certain flavor to it-- carries a load of expectation. Those poor readers who go into it expecting The Book of Ruth or some other typical Oprah pick are going to be angry, not just disappointed. Some bad things happen, but often the narrator is just cranky. You are not allowed to feel that you have understood the past; sometimes the main character just makes things up. No catharsis, no redemption, no Irish brogue. The prose is pretty, but pretty like a snake in the grass is pretty. It glitters and it hisses and it does not really let you touch its skin.

I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones, and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well, and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex, but some of it is even....funny. Yes, funny!

6083	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	In a fantasy land where vampires help humans to defeat an enemy from another dimension.  There's plenty of fighting action along with romance between vampire and human.  The characters were well developed so you could understand their relationships and emotions. This book is a great beginning to a series!

Charles is determined to deal with Leo and his pack-mates for the atrocities perpetrated against Anna. It normally happens that the human chooses a mate, and the inner wolf follows. For Charles, it happened backwards. If he had his way, he would have taken things slowly to woo Anna and to not scare her off by his intensity. However, Anna is reading him all wrong and he needs to let her know just how badly he wants her and to prove his loyalty to her.


9878	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This short story is like the first few chapters of a book that is not finished.  The author talks about battles between evil and good vampires.  The evil ones want to take Bliss as a breeder.  Caden takes her first to be his mate and the process makes her stronger to be able to better resist the evil ones.  This is the story of Bliss and Caden first getting together, having sex and turning her into a vampire.  This part of the story was complete.
Like the previous books in the series, THE ICEBOUND LAND ends with a cliffhanger. Having already defeated the dark lord and endured captivity, the series has also become more intriguing. Who knows what adventures will befall Will and his friends next? Will they continue to battle the human evils that run rampant in their world? Or will the disparate parties be called to unite against the threat of a greater supernatural evil once again?

Suetonius had the good fortune of speaking to eyewitnesses from the time of the early Caesars. Much of his information about Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero in fact comes from those who observed and/or participated in their lives. Suetonius is in many ways more of a reporter than an historian--he would record conflicting statements without worrying about the reconciliation (this set him apart from Tacitus and other classical historians who tried to find a consistency in stories and facts.
I'm also more interested in the interactions between the Kindle and the rest of the industry, both narrowly defined as the eReader industry, and more broadly defined as the publishing industry.  There are other blogs out there with a broader focus.  I'm sure I'll end up subscribing to one of them.  But this blog's focus is just too narrow for me.

Charli's not entirely comfortable with the changes taking place in her circle of friends.  However, she's been aware of a tension within the group ever since Rafael admitted to his bisexuality.  Before that, he and Eric had been very close.  Here in Cozumel where Lee, Lori Ann and Connie have chosen to speak their vows, Charli will be given the opportunity to fulfill her fantasies - and then some.  Charli's surprised to learn that she, Simon, Eric and Rafael have been registered for a naughty shore excursion called "The Race Erotic."  They'll endure a series of exciting challenges that will bring them closer than ever and force them to acknowledge feelings they'd previously fought to keep hidden.  Charli's fearful that this change to their friendship will destroy the relationship she's come to treasure with `her men.'  What will happen when the fantasy is over and the wedding party returns to reality?
If one is looking to fault Marx's economics based on the works of Capital, one will come up empty not only because Marx's logic is flawless, but as economist and former Marxist Thomas Sowell says, " ...Marx considered the idea of proving a concept to be ridiculous. Moreover, Engels had asserted...that one only proves one's ignorance of dialectics by thinking of it as a means by which things can be proved."(2)
This novel is at times painful to read.  It is a story that involves great cruelty and much suffering, but it is beautiful nonetheless.  If you are an avid reader, with a background in science fiction and fantasy and happen to be bilingual as well, this may be the most enjoyable book you have ever read.  My lack of Spanish fluency was an issue and caused me to teeter between four and five stars, but the story and writing were simply too good to fall below the highest rating.  Four and three-quarters stars rounds to five.
It has characters who are interesting from the moment they're introduced,
She did tell me a lot about this book and class talks in the classroom. It got her to rethink about eating and the class wasn't about that LOL but it help her to rethink about other things that the class was teaching too.
2) has excellent suggestions for breakfast including a good explanation of the differences in cereals.

Kelly McCullough has created a new subgenre in science fantasy with a fascinating blend of magical, mythological and computer elements mixed into a rollicking adventure filled with wild and wicked humor and nonstop action (and a dash of romantic relief). Read it!


The circumstances surrounding Alex, Chase, and Jasmine's separation and then their reunion, are realistic, as are the obstacles they face.  Their history together makes their quick bond natural. I would love to read more about how Chase and Alex got together. The little bit Alex tells Jasmine is angst-filled, heart-warming, and very sexy. The addition of Jasmine into Alex and Chase's relationship enhances their already strong bond. The chemistry between the three of them feels natural.  Coming Full Circle is an erotic romance with three times the trouble, three times the heat, and three times the love than your average romance.
The emphasis of this book are the teachings of Jesus Himself.  There are some who believe that the epistles should be a greater influence in the believer's life than the Gospels, and I lean that way (though I believe all the epistles should be the guideline, while others focus solely on Paul's letters).  However, MacArthur does cross reference the epistles.

To Let traces the family's fortunes through the turn of the 20th Century as the newer generations begin to consume rather than generate family wealth. This is a time of social and legal conflicts for the family that disrupt the order of their traditional lives.  The focus gradually changes to the youngest members of the family who, because of the devastating effects of the World War, believe that there is more to life than hoarding of riches, commodities that can disappear quickly.  These Forsytes pursue artistic and social justice activities and use the family money to go their own ways. The 4% rule is not forgotten, but rather never known by the youngsters.

9523	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	First the good:  The story is quite interesting and pulled me in right away.  It was in first person so if you don't like that style, you may not like this book.  I like how the first person went back and forth between Viola and Duke.  The story was internally-consistent and had a few surprises for me (which I won't spoil for you).  I had a hard time putting the book down when it was 1 am and I was about 3/4 through the book. That is always the sign of an engrossing story for me. Also, I LIKED the characters which is always important to me and I liked how they were fleshed out. For some strange reason, it reminded me a big of the "Fever" series by Karen Marie Moning. I'm not quite sure why as the story is very different but somehow it had the same flavor as that series. The end of the book indicates that the sequel, The Chaos Child, is coming out in Winter of 2010.  As long as it is a reasonable price, I will likely buy the sequel to Daugher of Deception as I can't wait to see what happens next.

Living Dead Girl does not shy away from the sexual abuse that is inflicted upon Alice. It's all there and it's raw, gritty, and horrifying. It's not hard at all to imagine everything that Alice is going through. I liked that the author wrote Alice in a realistic way. The fictional portrayal of children who are abused tends to be a bit off. They tend to be written as kids who would do whatever they can to make sure that the pain they are feeling won't be inflicted upon anyone else, when the reality is that those kids will do anything to get out of a situation like that even if it means having another innocent person take their place. Did this make Alice a little bit unsympathetic? Yes. Did this make her more real? Like you wouldn't believe.

I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!
  I didn't find the characters enticing nor fully filled out. Even our protagonist is a little hard to take because the first 20% or more of the book is spent wondering if he is a psychopath or not.  It is hard to change horses in the middle of a race, even if it is a slow one.
The list goes on and on.

3635	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	I am a fairly slow reader. Not sure if it's because I enjoy going slow and savoring a book; or if it's the book itself, drawing me in slowly; or, maybe it's that, while I enjoy the stories and characters, the writing is so-so. The Icebound Land is engaging, gripping, and kept me up well into the morning looking to see what's next. The story is simple compared to books one and two. It's about survival and loyalty and friendship and hope.
7129	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Dull, silly stories not worth reading.  Skipped many parts because they were just plain dumb.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Conclusion: If you're a series fan, definitely give this one a chance. If you're new to the series, consider checking out some of the earlier volumes first.
The men take a definite second place in this warm and touching novel and despite the highly serious tones, somehow Kendrick still manages to make her characters happy and brave. There is very little "poor little me" in this novel (and believe me when you read Ellie's story you will feel very sorry for her AND HATE HER HUSBAND). The women are strong and stand up for themselves.

It's time for another meeting of the BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.
Honestly, I enjoyed this novel, despite the oh so very embarrassingly trashy cover.  If you are a sci-fi fan and enjoy Linnea Sinclair or Paticia Waddell, then you'd like this one.  I also went out and bought another one by this author, so you may find her somewhat addicting.

8778	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Josh Lanyon's novella "The Dickens with Love" is a story of love, redemption and holiday spirit that will both entertain and charm its readers. Basically, this is a Christmas story about a Christmas story; it is clever, well-written, and frequently humorous, and it captures the many facets of the holiday season. Within the pages of this story, we find Christmas cheer, seasonal depression, music both annoying and inspiring, fellowship and family, and that magical feeling of anticipation that comes no other time of the year.
Overall: Heartbreaking, emotional, but a great story. This book is realistic and you will be sucked right into Alice's life. You will feel what she feels, think what she thinks, long for what she longs for.
I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.

I really liked the story and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I'm a strong believer that intimacy should only exist in marriage. There were no explicit scenes just behind closed doors.
8915	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoy reading, at any time I'll have at least three books I'm reading at the same time. So for me to say an audio book is good that's saying a lot. I like Richard Armitage, he's nice to look at and he's got a very pleasant voice. But I think in this case Richard's reading of this book is what makes it wonderful to listen to.

9751	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	This is a huge collection of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's works in one place for an unheard of price.  Like many kindle editions, no illustrations for these very old texts.  Links? What links?  You'll need to create your own, but worth the effort.  This series would make a perfect set for a metaphysical study group alone or as an adjunct to the Bailey material (Alice A Bailey).  Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society in 1875.  An amazing woman now, and even more amazing in her time, she traveled extensively in search of answers. She is responsible for bringing Buddhism to the Western world.  Her works on the ancient wisdom was the start of the new age movement as we know it today.  Her works may be a little difficult for the beginner to understand since 19th century language is so different.  But with some basic ground work (like Alice A Bailey's works) you should be able to work your way thru.  A study group with a leader who has some experience with this material is always advantageous, but should not be a deterrent for the determined seeker. There are texts here that are extremely hard to come by.  Theosophical student to occultist, inquiring mind to scholar, worth the time and the read.


It reads like something that would probably make a good TV series or miniseries.
It is over fifty years since I read these books and I still remember them. For some reason that I do not remember, I decided to read the first of the series The Warden.

When he found out she was married he refused to see her again but the press had taken pictures of the two.  Elise was in big trouble with her husband and she asked her sister who looked a lot like her to help her. What happens next is funny, sexy, and so hot.

This is a collection of stories all of which take place in the imaginative 100 Acre Woods revolving around Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends. The stories are a journey of friendship and of growing up. They would be great to read to your younger children, but they are also perfect for your early reader to read as they transition from being a "big kid" to being a kid. If you are nostalgic for your own childhood then I highly recommend that you pick up this book and relive a bit of magic that can be found between a child and their bear.

The phrase "pulp fiction" generally conveys something of lesser quality, trash, in fact.  I'll never make that assumption again having read Raymond Chandler, master of the genre.  Few authors in any genre have been able to write as well as he did.
In a word, Wildwood Dancing is frustrating. Writing for young adults does not require treating them like children, but Marillier does. The book is entirely predictable, and when the reader is a dozen steps ahead the story quickly grows dull. In the midst of such an obvious plot the characters come across as oblivious rather than the bright young women they are meant to be. Frustrating too is the book's conflict: the primary antagonist is a domineering male relative, and though (given the book's setting) conflict over gender roles and female repression is perfectly natural, here the conflict is so overt and exaggerated that it becomes a parody of itself. As the girls are stripped of more and more of their autonomy, the reader becomes less sympathetic and increasingly frustrated, wishing the author would just skip to the part where they reassert control. But when they do, it's somewhat anti-climactic. The solutions are too easy, and too much is engineered by outside forces. Rather than empowered, the sisters are more or less swept along to their predictable fates.

What an exciting premise around which to revolve a story.  A little girl loses her big sister to a killer and from that moment on her life is never the same.  Through science, she is driven to find justice for all victims of crime.  When she finds out she helped incarcerate an innocent man for killing her sister, she stops at nothing to find the actual killer.  She poses as an FBI Agent to insert herself into the Seattle Police Department's investigation of a serial killer -- believing him to be the man who killed her sister.

Tuttle uses Mama Hog again to good effect, and Granny Knot is a great new character. Once again, the many minor characters are vivid, even if their roles are somewhat fleeting. The cast is rather less confusing than say, in the latest Markhat book,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Banshee-s-Walk-A-Markhat-Novel/dp/B003P9XHQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Banshee's Walk: A Markhat Novel</a>, and the editing is much better than in the later book.

4254	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This book including the history of how Hungry Girl came to write could easily have been written by myself.  Even her recipes are very similar to the concoctions I have come up with in an effort to stay slim in Los Angeles amongst the beautiful people.  Hungry girl gave me some new and refreshing ideas to add to my own and I am grateful for that and give this book five stars. I love to eat, and I seem to need that satiated and full feeling in order to be satisfied.  I strongly disagree with some of the reviews that say the recipes do not taste good.  Perhaps you follow them too literally?  I don't know but I have been cooking for years and I just adjust things that don't seem right to me.  I just finished a large plate of chili cheese fries and it was absolutely satisfying and healthy too.  I was planning to make her macaroni and cheese later.  Her recipe calls for a family sized bag of cauliflower in cheese sauce combined with whole wheat penne.  My store did not have any of the cheese sauced cauliflower but I love the idea of using the cauliflower to "stretch" the pasta (a trick I often use by whipping a large head cauliflower in my food processor along with a large baked potato....taste great just like mashed potato with less calories, starch and carbs) so I will cut up a fresh cauliflower and will probably make a vegan cheese sauce using nutritional yeast to mix in but will also make use of her cube of light laughing cow cheese to add some more authentic cheesy taste.  I just love her ideas, they have really helped me to add variety!  I also love how many of her recipes are designed for one, that is so helpful to me.  After you look at her book, it's so easy to use the principles of volumizing the meal with vegetables and low calorie choices to make your own recipes.  For those who speak of the use of high sodium and/or unhealthy foods I think that Hungry Girl only includes these for occasional use and for the sake of convenience when you are pressed for time, something I can appreciate.  Most things are cooked from scratch using healthy items.  I don't actually know how many of the recipes I have followed without making any changes at all, but it's the inspirations that have proven most valuable to me.  The use of fiber one cereal to "fry" is great.  I make chicken fingers like this all the time.  I mean sure, it's not the same as a bucket of KFC, but come on people you have to make some sacrifice, and frankly I think she makes the sacrifices a lot easier to swallow.  I also like to "fry" eggplant slices in the oven using this method for a delicious eggplant parmesan.  I use nutritional yeast for the cheese when I make this.  Anyway, I think the folks giving the book a negative review are unable to use the recipes to their advantage and to form their own ideas.  A little common sense, cooking skills and imagination make this book a reference to return to time and time again.
Through her Eyes is a very erotic read with a bit of dominance and submission tossed in for good measure. The mystery of the murderer and how events in the past and in the future entangle to affect the present is very intriguing. Des and Claire seemed to have some attachment to one another before they actually ever meet. Especially since Des, an admitted sceptic of psychic abilities has actually experienced Claire's erotic dream of the night before with her! These two had a special connection that was there from their first interaction whether in the dream world or in reality. It was fun to work out the mystery along with Des and Claire and solve it Through her Eyes.
"Alice" tells the story through diary-like entries of her abduction and subsequent living arrangements with her kidnapper. This is a gritty, hard-core tale sunk deep into the mire of the reality of what happens to many children who disappear without a trace.

Only recently, through the careful work of the three maverick scientists tracked here by the author, have we been able to show mathematically that Bohr's intuition was correct: that electrons gain and lose energy constantly by exchanges and transfers from the ZPF in a dynamic equilibrium: balanced at exactly the right orbit. In fact their findings went much further even than this. By inference they were also able to establish that the ZPF not only accounts for the stability of electrons in the atom, but also for the stability of all matter! And conversely, their equations also showed that by pulling the plug on the ZPF atomic structures also collapsed. And even more astounding yet, their calculations also showed that ZPF waves drive the motion of subatomic particles; and that all the motion of all the particles of the universe in turn generates the ZPF! QED.

I confess a weakness for heroines who do not fit the classic model of decorum. I identify with women like Rebecca who struggle with to grow beyond her reputation as a troublemaker and to quit smoking. It's heroines like Rebecca that make Superromances sparkle, because they are flawed, sassy and real. And they get guys like Josh, a fantasy come true. And with author Brenda Novak's pen, they also get a very bumpy ride on the way to romance, filled with the emotional conundrums that makes her stories outrageous, fun and believable. A HUSBAND OF HER OWN comes highly recommended.

6230	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	Being a fan of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons I eagerly purchased The Rose Labyrinth and settled down for what I hoped would be a great read.  However, the overwhelming detail -- though informative in its own way -- managed to smother the plot development.  Reading was a laborous task and at several points I almost gave up the attempt to finish it.  Perhaps I am too impatient a reader, or maybe I was just having difficulty following Hardie's detailed background info, but I was reminded of the advice included in many books on writing: the plot should drive the story.  Though the subject matter intrigues me, I felt Hardie's knowledge and wanting to include so much of it in her novel caused her to lose sight of the plot far too often.
For that reason only - I am deducting a star.

It (SGR)is an easy read, and it's highly useful. You can get rich by acting in a certain way, and having certain beliefs. I believe this already.

The flow evened out perfectly and the first story was satisfying--I should have known, as is the case with a truly talented storyteller--this book would only get better.  Each story has its own flow--beginning, middle, end, and the book as a whole also has some great character growth. This isn't so much a collection of short stories as it is a set of adventures involving two (or more) great and funny characters.  There's wit, danger, intelligence--and most of all, Fun.

The one complaint I really have with the story is toward the end. I felt it got dragged out too long. The story could have ended 30-50 pages sooner. That would have meant cutting out a couple of major scenes in the story, but I felt those scenes just dragged down what had been a very dramatic rescue scene. By then, at least for me, it was obvious who the killer was, and the ending would have been much more satisfying if the resolution would have occurred there in the forest, in the snow storm. I'm deducting a star for that, bringing my final rating to four stars.

I bought the book the day it came out. I'm finished reading it now, months later. As with a few of the other reviewers, I found it very difficult to get through it. The first half was mostly food reviews and discourses. I was hoping for the wit and one sentence capturing of people and places that she used in her previous books. Not much of what she wrote made me want to visit Portugal, Spain, Naples, Fez and Burgundy. I too was a bit appalled by her lack of understanding for her fellow passengers on the Greek cruise. She had a free trip and basically denigrated the experience. Cruises aren't for everyone, but hey, most of us wouldn't turn down a free one and would try and find the best parts of the experience rather than wallowing in the worst.

These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.  Anything by Bill Myers makes this guy look worse than amateurish, though his Charismatic leanings come through pretty strongly.  Look, just find something else to buy.  This book isn't worth the effort.

Gus is just as sexy and alpha as the other Attracelli men, but Alana's determined to fight her attraction every step of the way. With good reason, since she's been burned pretty badly by marriage before. I love her do-gooder activities, her time with the kids, and her horror that people are more interested in whether or not she and Gus kissed last night than in giving some orphaned kids the opportunity to make it in life.
And I have to say; Booker is still one of my all time favorites in this series. He tries to put on the 'Bad Boy' image, but deep down he's one of the true good guys. He and Rebecca bot have had to fight the bad wrap in that town, so it's no wonder they became best friends.
It held my interest and I have read all of the other books that have followed after
The sisters have their own religion that involves a version of Catholicism and a mix of otherness that comes with the wooden boat mast of the black Madonna that hangs out in their living room and that they pray to saying the Hail Mary's to. Once a week they hold services there were other people in the town come to hear the message and pray and dance and touch the heart at the base of the statue.  This seems odd at first, but Lily and Rosaleen quickly get swept up in it.  And no one treats Lily different for being the only white person there. For a girl who has grown up without a mother, she seems to be gaining too many to count.  But the happiness cannot last and T. Ray hasn't given up on finding them and August may have to send them back once Lily tells them the real reason they are there and finds out what she needs to know about her mother, which she dreads to learn at first.  This book is quite wonderful and heartwarming and sometimes a bit heartbreaking.  It does touch on what things were like in the South in 1964 in an honest way while at times being a bit naive when it came to Lily.  I cannot recommend this book enough.

From the moment she moves back, she is torn between lusting after him and trying to keep her distance.  Soon, Trick realizes she's also brought her adolescent son (who he believes is his brother) and he wants to spend time with him.  So it becomes difficult for them to maintain their distance.

While I'm not certain I agree with all of the author's arguments, I did find his discussion of religion as an artifact of the way our brains are wired for different functions a more plausible and productive approach than that which tries to analyze what religion "does" for its practitioners.  I think that the latter approach was thoroughly done to death over the last century when religion as a cultural behavior finally became a "legal" object of study.

7767	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I was enjoying the first half of the book - not that well written, true, but I liked the hero's self-deprecating humor, also the fact that he was a broke 60-something who had to skim gas money given to him by his 80-something mom in order to buy cheap beer. Guess I'm just a sucker for the "loveable loser" type. However, as soon as he hooked up with Penny, who's somehow been pining away for him for over 40 years...I mean, it seemed pretty unlikely that she'd even have had a crush on him in high school, since she was a popular cheerleader type while he was a nerdy photo geek. The fact that she'd be available, still gorgeous, and wildly hot for him (balding, overweight, and living in his parent's basement at 60+) just was way too improbable and instantly the story took a turn deep into male wish fulfillment/fantasy. Ok, I'll give the author some credit for the fact that the wish fulfillment dream woman is 58 and not 22, but still... yeah, she's 58, all the guys in the book are hot for her, but she picks the oldest, weakest, least successful one. I'm so sure.

A well thought out and written novel. This book was received for free in exchange for an honest review.
PLOT: There was even LESS plot here than the product description implies. This was basically a continuation of book 1. There was no additional storyline. No additional conflict. No new bad guys. No new obstacles. It looked like Becky might have a long road to recovery after the attack- she needed to heal and to come to terms with what happened and finding out about the pumas... and that was all resolved in a couple paragraphs. Becky wasn't mad. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even badly injured. She didn't resist Simon. She didn't play hard to get. Simon didn't have to woo her or apologize. Simon supposedly had been a ladies' man- but even THAT didn't become an issue. No confrontation with Belinda or other exes. No discussion around why they never dated or expressed interest in each other sooner... NOTHING!!! More happened between these two in book 1 than here. It takes exactly one minute for Becky to just accept the existence of werecats, the fact that she's Simon's mate, and the fact that she has been turned into one.
There is plenty of action in the book. Of course, the motive for the murders is revealed near the end and I felt the book had a bit of a weak ending, but for a first novel in the series, this is a worthy effort. The cast is introduced and I am sure will be further developed as the series continues, as in the TV show.

Reiver raids along the border start to cause more trouble than Jareth and his not fully trained recruits can really handle-He inlists the help of a Scot clan to help with night surveilance missions. When Briana is out riding with some of the young trainees, she accidently happens upon these reivers (Trumbles men we find out)about to hang one of the Scot clans young boys-she hilariously rescues him.  (This proves to be very fortunate in the emotional climax of this story for Jareth!)

231	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	In Lisa Scottoline's "The Vendetta Defense", Judy Carrier went and did it: she took on a case that she had no business (as in it was not part of Rosato & Associates' legal business) taking. Judy agreed to defend a man accused of murder who admits to killing--not murdering--his lifelong nemesis, in fulfillment of a vendetta. Pigeon Tony freely confesses to the crime but sees no crime in it. There are mitigating circumstances which go back to Mussolini-era Italy and reach out to a crime committed just a year before the action of the novel takes place. (Ms. Scottoline is to be applauded for vividly bringing to life this tense period.) However, none of this will matter in court if Pigeon Tony testifies, which is what he wants to do. He fails to see why he should be punished for administering a justice he so clearly sees. This is not a murder mystery so much as a "How do you defend the murderer?" legal thriller.


BOTTOM LINE: This book was infuriatingly dull. I would tell you not to bother reading it, except I expect you probably need to if you want to bother with the rest of the series. I'm not really sure I do at this point. Ms. Bell's The Grey Court series is MUCH better than this one- at least it has a plot.

4. Searching the Text - At first, when I tried to search for a given text string, I received that error message saying that the book was not yet indexed and to try later.  I've run into that before with a book on Kindle when I've opened it for the first time.  But, after reading a while, after turning the pages a number of times, that problem cleared up with this book - as it has with other books in the past.  I think that, with some books, the Kindle isn't immediately synchronized to the searchable text, but at some point, synchronization occurs and, once it does, there are no further problems.  So, read for a bit, and you'll find everything is copacetic when it comes to searching the text.

Rory is a strong and interesting main character, and Bridget is the irritating little sister who makes things worse by trying to help.  The author has managed to balance serious ideas (like global warming and the Indian/Colonist conflict) with lighthearted moments (like a rat and squirrel kung fu fighting).  The story jumps back and forth between Manhattan and Mannahatta, until they merge with Rory's full understanding.  Which is a little bit confusing until you figure out who everyone is.

In trying to make sense of her brother's life she is perhaps only vaguely aware that she is trying to make sense of her own. Just as she discovers what had happened to her brother, the truth is not very pretty, devastating, in fact. Which makes it all the more remarkable and understandable that the truth she was keeping from herself she only now, as a result of her brother's demise, allowed herself to reclaim. The more we know about Veronica the more we realize that the harsh picture she depicts of those with whom she is in relationship with, her husband in particular, are not as flawed as she makes them out to be.

Overall, however, Men in Black isn't quite the incredible work of constitutional writing that some of its endorsers claim. Mark Levin seems upset at the Supreme Court more for the trend toward more liberal thinking than for its supposed violations of the U.S. Constitution. If the Supreme Court was violating the Constitution in favor of a position that he and his fellow conservatives approve, then I doubt he would say anything about it. He also seems to believe that the will of the people is sufficient to trample on rights. It all adds up to a less than average book that fails to convince me of its initial premise: That the U.S. Supreme Court has excessive power and wields too much influence. It's a nice effort, but it doesn't quite convince.

However, the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character, no one is perfect after all, there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story, even for the cheap price. It's short and doesn't really make the reader feel any emotion.

And that she sure got because on her journey she met funny old ladies, monsters, bandits, and saw the how angry the people in the north are. I liked her because even though it got tough she never gave up. Then we have the evil guys. The king's brother wants the throne and the Grey Man uses magic to make people do his will. He is an evil killer and he has also made a crack in a wall that separates the badlands from the rest of the world. I liked the Grey Man, as much as one can like an evil guy. He was just a good bad guy. All evil and nothing at all to like about him.
The first chapters were interesting. Even though the premise is so cliche --- secretary falls in love with rich boss --- the book started well. Then we find out from H's POV that he likes the h too.

OK, about this particular story. It's a happy ever after short story, the only thing that makes is unusual, and the reason I read it in the first place, is that it involves Charles, whom we've seen before, and I like him. Then you add Anna, who is at the very bottom of her pack structure and you get a sense of how bad things could be in werewolf culture without a Marrok to try to keep their world, if not safe, at least relatively fair. This is a book about unfair getting it's just reward. The plot is in how it comes about. Very quickly you realize that Anna is being victimized and that Justice is going to be served. I'd like it better longer, but it is a prequel. I admit to thinking that it's overpriced for a novella and if I were taking that into account I'd only give it 3 stars for value, but based just on the pleasure of reading the story, for that it's a good 5 star read.

Whether one agrees with the Marxian premises about the need for revolution and for a dialectical materialist conception of the workings of society or not one still must, if for no other reason that to be smart about the doings of the world, confront the problem of how to break the stalemate over where human history is heading. 'Globalization' has clearly demonstrated only that the 'race to the bottom' inherent in the inner workings of capitalism is continuing at full throttle. Moreover, the contradictions and boom/bust cycles of capitalism have not been resolved. And those results have not been pretty for the peoples of the world.
The problem with this empirical observation is that before there was a steam mill there already existed an industrial capitalist society that not only contained the requisite industrial capitalist mode of production that manufactured the necessary constituent parts that went into the creation of the steam mill (there were many companies involved in the problem-solving for and manufacture of components that went into a steam engine), but this pre-steam mill society also contained an already sophisticated industrial capitalist labor force that made the constituent parts for the steam mill, not to mention built the steam mill itself. Contemporaneous with the industrial capitalist production of steam engines, there existed the production of the machines that the steam engines would power. In other words, the steam mill presupposes an already functioning industrial capitalist society! Marx's rebuke to Proudhon is a tautological response that also fails to recognize that a steam engine is made up of independently manufactured parts that predates the manufacture of a steam engine with those independently manufactured parts! Marx fails to mention this double inconsistency with his material "productive forces" empirical observation.
The h is a strong, successful female trying to have it all and the H is a laid back guy who woos her into questioning her life choices.  I love this authors characters, they rarely disappoint.  It is a cute story, not a lot of angst, a little predictable but I really enjoyed it.
As a no-nonsense widow and the mother of a young adult daughter, Sophia is mindful of her family's needs, while still being very aware of her own as a woman.  When the death of her husband left her as part-owner in his business, she never hesitated to roll up her sleeves and work in the family business alongside her friend and partner, Ethan.  She knows Ethan would do anything for her, but worries that her growing romantic ideas about him are born of their close proximity and her dependence on his presence in her life.  While she is ready to admit her feelings, she needs time away to be sure of them before running the risk of damaging their friendship.

The title essay has Raymond Chandler's thoughts on the detective story. Fiction has always tried to be realistic, but tastes change (perceptions of reality). Detective stories often outsell the best-sellers of yesteryear (perhaps because the situations they describe are always current, even if the language and costumes change). Chandler contrasts the writings of Hammett and others to the classic post-WW One fiction (which is usually contained in the houses of the rich and powerful). Chandler lists the problems with A.A. Milne's "The Red House Mystery". They are too contrived, and disregard life in the real world. The realism of Hammett (and others) is how they describe the world that is seldom reported in your daily newspaper, except obliquely ("Zoning Board Adopts Changes"). This essay offers wisdom and an overview of detective stories.
Now, since actual labor is required for there to be potential value, and there is no actual labor to speak of, then the potential imputation of labor value into machines/commodities is zero, and therefore Marx's Law of Value is in error.

When I first met Remi in Without Reservations he was the somewhat homophobic best friend of Chayton Winston, a veterinarian and mate of Keaton Reynolds. Initially it was difficult for me to accept Remi in a gay relationship as well as the change in his personality, however the author provided a plausible explanation for his change of mind about Chay's and Keaton's relationship as well as the major shift in his own sexual orientation. It seems that Remi had a deep, dark secret that he had never admitted to himself or anyone else until it's almost too late.

It's forgiveable that the conversations and attitudes were more 21st than 19th century, and that Ms. Haymore glossed over the social implications of Sophie's position.  This is such an innovative story and those things were necessary to the plot. The writing was a bit clunky especially in the first half of the book, but improved considerably once the action got underway. I did get a little tired of Sophie's angstiness, and there were several chapters where nothing much happened, but something about this book makes me want to read the next one.

Don't worry, I won't give away the ending here!  It's a completely subjective thing, but I strongly felt that Sophie made the wrong choice, and I didn't feel that her internal dialogue or her actions gave me a reason to understand why she made the decision she did.  I felt very, very bad for the person who was left out in the cold, and it just felt depressing.  Plus, the ending seemed fantastical to me -- there is NO WAY the situation would have been resolved like that in regency English peerage.  In the end, I just felt annoyed with Sophie and heartbroken for the one left alone.

This is not to say the others are not based on a foundation of fact, rather the draw more heavily from works the posit a certain version of the future. THis one, however, draws heavily upon Constitutional history to make points. I found this refreshing because it showed me that the conservative commentator can be informed, not simply opinionated. This just made the book a really impressive work. The main point of the book is that the unchecked power of the judiciary has gone too far, and is threatening the individual freedom that American citizens enjoy.
The story is told in first-person from the POV of Sir Dardanus, but what makes that unique for me is that he's really an anti-hero, "a bastard and ne'er-do-well, a murderer and a seducer of women." Just what won't this man do in order to get what he desires? Even at the end, I was still a bit uncertain about what he'd actually do, and with the way the author left the final page, I have to wonder how or if this romance will continue. I choose to see hope and promise there, mixed with the darkness.

Crops are destroyed, the house burned down, the husband killed and one of the daughters is raped and murdered.

Levin offers readers an outstanding discussion of the most important court cases in our nation's history. Many of them I had read about before but have long since forgotten. His discussion of religion in Chapter 3 and the establishment clause was thoroughly enlightening. Specifically, we see how cases like Everson v. Board of Education created the fallacious doctrine of there being a "wall of separation" between church and state. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Wallace v. Jeffree illustrates the method by which this notion was created. "Justices in the Bedroom" in Chapter Five was a standout as well, but most topical was Chapter Ten, "Silencing Political Debate." To what extent does McCain-Feingold erode our liberties? Right now it's hard to say. I agree with the author that advertising is speech, and the recent letter Obama sent to the Justice Department concerning the William Ayers ad put out by a 527 organization is an example of how the left will take advantage of any loophole as a means to silence their critics. Overall, we are not as free as we used to be and Mark Levin's Men in Black illustrates why this is the case.

It is very annoying when the first few chapters demonstrate interesting writing and good potentials for the plots and then it just stops, not going anywhere. Nothing signficant happens until page 142, and even that is not very interesting at all.  Throughout the book, there is numerous unnecessary mentioning of sex, as if it is from one of SNL sketches where it gets mentioned randomly (remember one of the sketches with Tom Hanks where "penis" is said multiple times?).  I get that sex is relevant to this story, afterall, perpetual pregnant state of the protagonist's mother is a ubiquitous reminder of sex but in this case, just too random and feels almost too cheap.

While Veronica may have wanted to tell Liam's story, by the end of the book I knew precious little about him - she focuses instead on Ada and Lamb, and a large part of that story appears to have come out of her own imagination. It also becomes obvious that she hates men in general, and Tom - her poor husband - appears to be utterly baffled as to where some of her comments are coming from. (It's never made clear where this hatred came from and I finished the book wondering exactly what had happened to Veronica). Somehow, she oblivious to her hatred, and apparently confuses poison and bitterness with insight and wisdom. She frequently refers to herself as "the one who loved him [Liam] the most" - a line that I found harder and harder to believe the more and more she said it. A struggle, and not a book I'd recommend - though I would say it was more deserving of the 2007 Booker Prize than "On Chesil Beach".

As with all the Jacky Faber adventures, the book is full of high action and adventure, refreshingly strong characters, and fascinating history (refreshingly lively, not bogged down in didactic details, which is unique both for its audience and the genre).

Nothing below that.  I can believe it.  I just finished reading the 4th book in this series and I was very impressed.  Somehow John writes a story for young adults but does not sugar-coat it, and makes it very readable for adults like me (over 50+ yrs).  The characters are well developed and the author makes sure each character has his or her fair share of "prime time".  By not sugar-coating the story, I mean this story features many fighting scenes, and a well detailed battle.  People fight and die on both sides of the battle.  Remember the A-Team TV show?  Bullets zipping all over the place, explosions, and cars crashing and flipping over and yet, no one ever died!  Not even hurt too bad.  Talk about watered down violence!  John manages to walk a fine line here, he does not write the battle scenes too easy or too gory.  I am very much a Die Hard type of reader/movie viewer, but I am very much in the storyline and characters of the Ranger's Apprentice.  I would love to see a movie version of this series.

I would not have purchased this had I been given that information in the description. I do not enjoy that type of story and it destroyed the story for me. That stated, if you like that type of subject matter, you will likely enjoy the book.  It does have some glaring grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of objective and subjective pronouns, and mixed tense in the same sentence.

The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.
At the heart of the story are two very different, but engrossing romances. Eldest sister Tati's forbidden love follows a fairly predictable pattern, but it's still a good story. Jena's romance is a more unusual one and very satisfying.

Everything that happened to them in the past affects their future as well as present.  He claims that his family life isn't relevant to his life now, but his whole mindset was from the past and I find it hard to believe that as a two year old he would have had that type of mindset.  Easier to believe it of Francesca.  Given his explanation it didn't seem to wash because frankly had she taken the time, by investigating things, she could have discovered that her father had a similar story too.  So because of his his past he had "short-term relationships with air-heads who couldn't possibly match (his) intellect, or interest (him) in any way other than physically. . . ".  But for some reason he remained friends with these women and would even go out with them.

The book in my opinion was largely about young people trying to make their way in the world. They live in an industrial society where you must first be educated or apprenticed before you make a living. This was true back in the 1800s and is still true today so modern readers will recognize the struggles and pitfalls of the characters.

Megan is a by-the-book FBI agent investigating veterans who had been tortured and killed.  Jack is a former veteran and now a soldier-for-hire.  He joins with Megan to find the killers after his best friend is killed (one of the victims).  We learn early in the story who the killers are (Ethan and Karin) so I'm not giving anything away.  Ethan was with a group of soldiers in Afghanistan.  He was captured and tortured for three months by the Taliban before being rescued.  He is suicidal and loaded with mental problems.  Karin wants to learn torture techniques, but Ethan won't teach her.  Therefore she convinces Ethan that he needs to capture and torture the veterans who were with him at the time, saying they abandoned him.  She plans and helps him capture the vets, and then learns by watching Ethan stick needles into them.  The main mystery is finding the killers, but a second mystery is why Karin wants to learn to torture.

However, the evil twin of that pleasure is the unmitigated pain of wasting precious time slogging through something you can't stand. Unfortunately, not only does this Booker Prize-winner stand firmly in that second category, it is the champion of it: the most hated book of the 70+ I've read for my bookclub, and the least enjoyable work of fiction I've read this year (out of roughly 100 or so books).

From the beginning it hooks your attention with a rather steamy and erotic dream and carries through with an interesting plot and dynamic characters. Chloe is a contradiction - at work she is settling for a job beneeath her abilities instead of the career she is qualified for yet in the bedroom with Sean she is not afraid to ask or even demand her satisfaction. It is very evident that he brings out her sensual side. Their relationship takes center stage in the book yet the intrigue of the embezzlement rounds out the story nicely. The sex scenes were appropriate for an erotic romance, steamy, explicit and somewhat uncontrolled." - Lisa Freeman

It is so vivid that I found it painful to read, yet fascinating as several dear friends of mine from the past are Dominican. I learned a lot of history from the novel - where they came from and what their particular dictatorship was like.  From there, the survivors remain caught in history's web, either acting out the same pattern or consciously attempting to live a life that negates it.

I don't think we would have known more about him if he had been the narrator. He is exceptionally vulnerable, but his vulnerability doesn't depend on his personality, instead it's the result of his illness and the decisions his grandfather made for him. Julian is delicate, but he is not a damsel in distress that needs to be saved by a knight in a shiny armour, he's extremely dignified.

Now if you don't mind a very edgy book, this is amazing.  The lead character Ann finds herself alternating between discovering the sensual appeal of Masques and the cruelty of the radical jihadist.  It is scary, I found myself often nodding and realizing that everything that happened in book could happen here, in real life.  The author researched tirelessly and was very well read and descriptive on the different Muslim cultures, ways and segregation.  Ann is at the wrong place at the wrong time, she witnesses the shot that started the next great world war.  From there she watches almost like an obsessive zombie (yes I know that's an oxymoron) as Europe collapses, America's downfall is much more seductive and under the radar.

As for the ending... it's supposed to come across as tragic, but the circumstances of Oscar's death feel less tragic and more stupid to me. I have little sympathy for Oscar's death when it's his own stupidity and hormones that got him killed, and said ending elicited a facepalm from me instead of tears. Not to mention that the final chapter of the book is supposed to be hopeful because Oscar finally got laid before he died. Seriously? I had hoped to find a kindred spirit of sorts in Oscar, but instead he turns out to be the stereotypical fat nerd who just wants to lose his virginity to a hot girl. *sigh*

1256	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This novel about a Dominican boy, Oscar, who grows up in New Jersey is packed full of stories, all kinds of stories. Theres growing-up stories, family stories, history-of-the-Dominican-Republic stories, gangster stories, and love stories. The narrator, Yunior, one time college roommate of Oscar and on-again off-again boyfriend of Oscars sister Lola, tells Oscars story in conjunction with that of his family, going back and forth in time to narrate the history of Oscars family, and back and forth between New Jersey and the Dominican Republic, a culture whose history and traditions come to have as much influence on Oscar as the comic books and science fiction novels he spends all his time reading and writing during his short life. This book is crackling with an astounding storytelling energy, a vast number of colourful minor characters, and a spirit and tone thats both cynical and open to the romantic yearnings of life. The numerous pop culture references which pepper its pages lend it a unique, contemporary style while also embodying the modern American male adolescent type to which Oscar belongs. This is a spontaneous, joyful, funny novel full of love and tragedy written in a hip style expressing modern, relevant themes.

It has just enough back story to fill you in on the current state of the world, and in Cantrell fashion, leaves you thinking after finishing the last sentence. This time, though, the ending felt more rewarding because there was plenty of clarity from previous chapters to know what it all meant.

Jealousy is one thing, but leaving a woman alone and unprotected when it is your job to protect and you know she is a target on some bullshoot misperception? Really? How insulting to law enforcement officers. Another very wrong is how the author portrayed him in talking to his youngest son. I thought I was ready words spoken by a woman. The author failed in writing from a male prospective. Next wrong, Detective Davies. He is an active law enforcement officer and comes into another jurisdiction with vital case information and doesn't immediately go to the law enforcement office with it?! What true detective would do such a thing? None. Two girls were taken after he got to town and may not have if he had done what a real detective would have. Instead he approaches Thatcher at a kids athletic event and doesn't identify himself but gets pissy because he's spoken to as if he was a reporter and given the appropriate response by Thatcher thinking he is a reporter then he stalks off!!!!! More problems - Dr. Marshall has two professionally trained German Shephards and the don't growl and bark at the intruder on the balcony? Dr. Marshall is a brown belt in karate and doesn't use her skills to knock down and knock out the killer, but runs and gets tackled and drugged? Not to mention allowing her former fiance's dad to talk her into leaving the house when she knew a killer was targeting her? All of this made this book sad and I was ready not to finish it and have no desire to read other books by this author because I can see this kind of ridiculousness making reappearance in her other books.

The prose is incredulously lyrical, rich, and refined - so much more compressed and yet detailed any prose in most contemporary fiction. Banville is one of the few living author who can maintain the flow of a novel with a taut sense while flourishing different themes as well as exploring and exposing, delineating the intricacies of human emotions. The book leaves us in awe of the marvelous silence with which human tolerate lies. Once again Banville has epitomized literary fiction with a twisting intrigue, which is unfortunately exiguous in the market now.

And to me it makes the point that you've got the power. The book suggest you put all other systems aside in favor of its system or it won't work: a technique often used in brainwashing. I submit again, you have nothing to lose. The promise it makes is that you have the power inside you to make things happen...Sounds like a good idea, even if a little brainwashing is involved. If after awhile, it doesn't work, go back to looking for outside forces and help. Wattles doesn't discount a creator but instead claims the creator has given you power over the process.

As a big fan of Robert B. Parker's series of Spenser, this quickly jumped into a series I wanted to read. Though it does, obviously, start with book one mirroring one of the episodes from the television series, there are enough differences I feel like I am not reading a novelization. Johnson does well in bringing what would normally appear mundane for a small-time sheriff into the a mystery that requires interaction with other characters as eccentric as the sheriff in order to solve this crime of murder. With a nice twist I was not expecting at the end, Johnson has shown he has the feel of a great western-mystery writer.
About the middle of the book there is a key event in the story that also I found less than convincing, but I cannot go too much in detail about it at the risk o spoiling the plot. Lets just say that the rage and obsession of one of the main characters, whom eventually blows up in a fireball, is not 100% believable. I wish I could go into more detail. Let's just say that the reaction of that character was a bit excessive in my opinion. Likewise, one of the female heroines falls in love, and manages from then on to trust blindly, with one of the male counterparts a bit too fast. A few more pages there would have made it a bit more believable.

When you act like you know what you are doing and where you are going, people tend to let you do whatever you want.

These books are about atmosphere more than action.  The murder takes place right at the beginning in the first book, but not in the other two.

***Spoiler**** (not much of one since I didn't finish it, but wanted to warn)
Chandler looked on his short stories as apprentice work, but some of these early stories have a kind of power that, though cruder, is also different from the power that appears in the novels. Their detectives are less wittily aloof from the crimes they get involved in, and their lives seem a little dirtier in general. Considering what Marlowe himself goes through, that says quite a bit.

This story is a form of trial by happenstance, with Ky performing well personally, but having problems with some of the extra people on board.

Walt Longmire is not your average literary hero well, actually, he is average. Hes handsome in a rugged way. Hes over 50 and hes described more than once as being out of shape. Hes been mourning the loss of his wife long enough in his friends opinion, which reinforces the fact that hes surrounded by people who care about him as much as he cares about them. Hes honest, loyal, well educated, has a strong sense of honor basically hes one of the most real characters Ive read in a long time. One of my favorite parts of reading this book was his inner dialogue. I loved it. His thoughts are easy and honest and yes, he tends to ramble, but that keeps it entertaining.

In the same way, you miss a lot of the storyline if you haven't read certain books. For example, Oscar often speaks in Dune-language. He says at one point his grandmother "tried to use the Voice" on him. This is a power of the Bene Gesserit in Dune, where they could subtly control someone's actions by speaking in a certain way to them. In another part he is afraid, and starts quoting "Fear is the mind killer" which is the Bene Gesserit "Litany Against Fear". The whole litany gives a mental environment for handling fear, which the reader is expected to know and understand.

154	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	This book deserves some wheres between 2 and 3 stars. It's an attempt to be the typical young adult learns about herself and her place in the world story, but falls short. The protagonist is so exceptionally neurotic, and wears it on her sleeve, that I find it implausible she'd be seen as any kind of leader. Ky lives in a world where nearly everyone is unhelpful, where apparently despite her father's wealth and influence, doors shut in her face time after time and where mid-level bureaucrats go out of their way to be officious and make enemies. Give me a break. There's a fundamental misunderstanding here of what power and influence are, I think. The author's attempt to show-off Ky's trading skills also fall flat. Moon's idea of a negotiator is someone who browses on-line prices, makes zero attempt at face to face negotiating, and settles for what she is offered. We are told how wonderful Ky is, but nothing I saw (with one violent exception) reinforces that; Moon just can't pull it off. My reaction is too often "This isn't the way a young person thinks or acts..." If you're willing to be told (everyone around Ky is more than willing to tell her how impressed they are with her) what to think about her, then you've passed one hurdle in enjoying this book. As the first of a series, perhaps the holes will be plugged in later books. The big problem I have is why doesn't Ky see these holes? The underclassman who sabotaged her - she (and her family!) just shrug off his indirect assault?? Her "boy friend" who turns out to be not only a selfish cad (apparently, the concept that one important lesson TEENAGERS learn is to pick their friends, isn't true here) but more than willing to make an enemy for inexplicable motivations. What?!  And where did those two mystery ships go? Why didn't Ky care? I guess I just don't get it. No one seems on the ball enough to see the potential for hostile intent operating behind the scenes? Really? In a world where electronic systems are pervasive, potential hacking is disregarded? Really? Ky is put in a situation where she really should know, based on her training, that she needs help to supervise the "passengers" she's given, yet she asks for none. The question you should ask is: is such a blunder - which is a key plot turning point - consistent with how "wily" she supposedly is? Ky's only real talent, from what I see, is she's astoundingly financially lucky. She is presented on a plate with money making deals when she needs them, time after time. There seems to be two stories here: one of a wonderkind blazing a path to become a Galaxy class entrepreneur and the other of an average kid who is muddling through the obstacles life throws at her. The first has no bearing (aside from in Moon's mind) with what actually happens, and the second could have made a great story if the protagonist just wasn't so whiny (she talks down to herself constantly).

This book is extremely complex and the characters are much richer than its predecessor. The emotion throughout the book was at a very high pitch and at times I felt as if my stomach was in knots because the action was non stop. There is so much going on it's difficult to know where to stop in terms of talking about the storyline because of the danger of being a spoiler. There is a murder investigation, extreme violence against members of Remi's family, a horrifying incident in the past, collusion between law enforcement agencies in an investigation several years ago, as well as a recent tragedy, all of which heighten the pressure in the already intense love story between Remi and Jake.

The character of Philo Vance comes off as ridiculous, a pretentious, wealthy snob who loves art and whose intellect is light years ahead of the District Attorney and the police, except that it couldn't be.  If Vance solves the crime, it seems absolutely contrived and unconvincing that he could do it.  He affects an English accent along the lines of Lord Peter Wimsey, but is so snobbish he peppers his vocabulary with lots of Latin, Greek and French words and expressions.  A dictionary is a helpful companion to reading these books, but sometimes the typical collegiate or abridged dictionary won't help.  The net result is that Vance comes off as a foppish, arrogant fool who fancies himself to be much more than he is.  That he ends up solving the crime seems, ultimately, to be highly improbable.  In the process of getting there, I the reader, wasn't nearly entertained enough by the story itself.  For me, the stories just aren't that intriguing and the storytelling isn't either.

Positives:
[I have now read a number of the mostly-negative Amazon reviews. Yes, this is a non-linear narrative, but I found that exhilarating rather than difficult. Others might be disturbed by the unreliability of the reporting, but it leads to some marvelous effects, such as the set-piece description of the meeting of Ada Merriman and Lambert Nugent in chapter 3 that is turned on its head in the last few sentences. It also makes it less a history of events than a psychological portrait of the narrator, which is surely the main point. As for the obsession with sexual organs, especially male ones, I see this in retrospect as a meaningful reflection of Veronica's trauma -- but I admit to being irritated at the time by what I took as merely a regrettable quirk of Enright's style.]
In one part of the book she "shot" the wolf (Jason) and while the others were running after the wounded wolf she was supposed to finish him off. She never shot him and told them she had mortally wounded him and he slipped away into the sewer system. There was no blood mentioned any where in this description and if he were mortally wounded there should have been blood which the other hunters did not notice. Jason didn't even cut himself to plant the blood on the ground. But later on in the book there was a pool of blood after a wolf got shot in the belly so it's not that werewolves don't bleed. That was just one of the inconsistencies.

Christina is the daughter of Lt Col Patrick Matthews who is a test pilot for Boeing.  He had wanted to be an astronaut, but did not qualify.  Chris loses her mother at 12 yrs of age, and through her next 10 years or so, struggles with the deep loss.  Her father has also become distant to her, thus she became very independent early in life.  She was a tomboy: tough, confident, and one who's motto is, "Never give in, never give up."  At a young age she had a solitary goal that she has set for her future.  Finished with high school, Chris and her two very close girl friends form a close bond through the early college years.  Chris decides to take flying lessons and her flight instructor feels she has a natural talent.  The three girls face many challenges, and Chris seems to be the most logical and confident of the girls.  She confronts every conflict they are faced with and becomes a hero.  This story is simply written, easy to read, and may be more suited for older teenagers, but I absolutely loved it.  Perhaps because it sparked my memories of flying years ago in a Beechcraft Bonanza where I experienced many adventures.  I think this story may encourage many young people to set such high goals.  I strongly recommend this book if you like high action adventure.  I will be reading the sequel soon!

Very few authors can sustain excellence over a long series of books. Even with trilogies it is common to find one volume that is weaker than the rest. That is a part of what makes The Ranger's Apprentice series so amazing. The Battle for Skandia is the fourth Ranger's Apprentice novel and, like the trio that precede it, this is a marvelous read. The story is fast-paced and exciting and the action is described in evocative language that places the reader squarely in the world Mr. Flanagan has created. Unlike the characters in many other series, those in The Ranger's Apprentice continue to change and grow with each volume. I'd say this was my favorite book in the series, but honestly, it's very hard to choose one over the others. They are all that good.

Again the ever helpful Fisk is there to help and again Sophie does not think he has the best of Garrett in mind.  Tristan is determined to find out what has happened and what exactly is going on with this man that Garrett trusts so much but seems to have no past to connect with him excluding the battle.

And if none of that sounds stupid enough to you, how about the part where the indian hero of the story makes butt beads out of vine and berries and sticks them in the heroine's butt to spice things up.

Longmire's investigation points toward Henry...Longmire's best friend, and uncle of the rape victim.

Robert Hicks, in his debut work of fiction, sets out to prove otherwise.  With his own research around Franklin, TN, he has gathered facts and anecdotes to bolster his story of the infamous battle fought in this region.  With his own history as a Southerner, he has unique insight into the mindset of those involved in the battle.  But is he able to turn these strengths into a gripping tale which orbits the grim servitude of one Carrie McGavock, a woman who has lost three of her own children and now finds herself immersed in the lives of soldiers wounded and dying?
Briggs brings a lush, atmospheric feel to this particular story ("Though he smelled of anger, he also smelled like spring rain, wolf, and man"), as well as some unexpected plot twists and an ending that paves the way for future stories about Anna and Charles. And she does a good job dealing with the concept of "omega wolves" -- sort of a lupine "class clown" of very low rank -- and their importance to werewolves.

Why is it banned? The whole book is child abuse and repeated rape. Nothing is presented to be titillating or erotic, rather it will disturb you. Disturb you to want to do something to prevent this from happening to any child. Other books I have read along this same vein are David Pelzer's memoirs (like A Boy Called It) and Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones. These books will wrench your heart. You would have to be quite mature to read this and I would say maybe 17 at the earliest.

7420	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I love this author.  She never fails to make you feel a variety of emotions throughout her books.  I did my share of giggling and also getting choked up during this story.  Not to mention she writes fantastic love scenes.  Here is something that I genuinely love about a lot of her stories.  The parties fall deeply in love and a lot of the struggles and obstacles they have to tackle throughout the book are, for the most part, handled together.  There is still heavy emotion and intrigue, but not because the whole story is taken up by them mistreating and/or believing something so wrong about the other party and then finally being clarified in the last 5 pages of the book.  Did I particularly love the "surprise twist" everyone has been referring to?  Well, clearly it's every author's own prerogative to write the things they do.  I have mixed feelings about the way it all truly played out.  However, I can still acknowledge that it was a fabulous story and incredibly emotional and passion-filled.  I loved the mens' total devotion to Emi and their steadfast loyalty and protection.  Loved it!!!  And how cute were the Twins and how broodingly sexy was the Captain?  Loved the personalities and all their fun interaction.

Kendi, another major character, evokes similar feelings in that he needs to become more mature. For a different twist, he is in love with another man who recently rebuffed him.
This is a well written book that reflects the nature of the USA at that time in history.  The writing is considered quite bigoted and racist by the way that we think today.  However, I believe that the book reflects the thoughts and feelings of both the Native Americans and the European Settlers at the time depicted and needs to be read from that perspective.  Don't judge the author by the nature of the characters of the time.  They are accurately depicted in this historical novel
The Misters are trolls. These are not your cutesy little bridge trolls (or even the ones who hang out on discussion boards), that would be too easy. These are big, scary, long-fanged, gargly-voiced trolls with translation spells, definitely not adorable.
This is easy to read and David Kirkpartrick provides a journalistic approach with regards to the history of Facebook. It provides details on how Mark Zuckerberg started the company,its history during the early days,a chronicle of its success and missteps, and how it managed to climb atop the mountain of success. It also tells us the story of how Zuckerberg never wavered with regards to the vision of his company  and how it dominated the internet particularly when it comes to social media. Added to that,it provides a narrative on the growth of the company and where it is headed in the years to come as a social network enabler rather than a destination that people will go to. It is definitely a better alternative "The Accidental Billionaires",a book that also tells the story of Facebook.

Even crazier? I'm enjoying the book despite all those flaws.

The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.  This was a fantastic story and I will be reading more of the books in this series.


So why did I give it 2 stars?  Well, the premise was good, the book really makes things sound exciting, and the direct-comparisons showing the nutritional values of the HG versions next to the real things were a good tool.  Some decent information was hidden within the pages.  The book itself is mildly entertaining if you don't mind cutesy word play.  It's just too bad that I thought a recipe book should be about palatable food, I guess.  One thing about it - I would definitely lose weight if I attempted to eat only the foods made from these recipes.

Ms. Miles is so open, honest and inviting in her writing that it seems more a conversation than a book (I responded several times to her chatting).  Her enthusiasm and commitment, as well as sound theology, led me to consider doing the difficult work of a Food Pantry.  Her conversion is displayed by action, and is not limited to quoting scripture or directing a Bible study, although she does those things as well.  She uses "real" (adult) language to speak of her being elation, frustration, delight, anger, joy, fear and the accomplishments she finds in becoming a Christ-Follower.  She never tries to mask the difficulty of following Jesus.  She invites the reader to consider the Gospel, a challenge made greater by her example.
If you like paranormal romance, get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook.

CONS:
A sadistic killer stalks teenage girls and malicious mischief and threats of harm start to pile up against Jenna. Steven is captivated by her but wounded by a past that shook him to the core. He's no closer to identifying and stopping a monster and he keeps messing up the relationship he desperately wants to pursue with the first woman to make it past his shields since his wife's death. Tension and stress reach explosive levels and keeping Jenna safe starts taking priority, but his family is falling apart and his job is becoming  more and more frantic. There's just so much one man can take before everything goes boom.

Though short I loved reading this. Number one, the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver. It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress! The second thing that made this a hit for me was how easy it was for me to slip into the story.

"Crossing Hitler" offers a wider audience the chance to learn about Hans Litten.  He is a celebrity in Germany, with many buildings and streets named after him, and well known among those in the German legal system.  Yet he is relatively unknown to the wider world.  Perhaps Hett's biography can help that.  Benjamin Carter Hett does a commendable job, but his narrative is too disjointed at times due to the amount of facts and figures he throws in, that it disrupts from the story at hand.  Those facts and figures are important, just as telling the too little known story of Hans Litten is important, to help understand those horrific times in our world's history.

The Good: This will be said a lot as Bookworm reviews this series but it is no less true. The characters are what pulls this book through beginning to end. The best way to thoroughly explore a character is to take them out of their element and introduce new challenges to be thrown in their way. The author does this with all of the major characters to great effect.
Tara and Max was able to get to know each other as employee-employer first before they became romantically involved.

I truly loved this book and only gave it one star away from perfect because I choose not to share it with others for the first reason I mentioned above.

Okay I loved this story, but if you aren't into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don't read this story.  It is a quick read, but it totally had my attention.

And the dissolving of the family, under the cancerous notion that the family is nothing but a unit of industrial oppresion and productivity?  Insane.

While there are some distracting holes in the story (How does Mary make a living as a pretty much part-time reporter at a local weekly magazine? How does she spend a week with a handsome stranger in Maine with only the clothes on her back?, etc.), the characters are memorable, endearing, and real. Even non-knitters will be sucked into the unfolding stories and stick with it until the end -- and maybe even learn to knit along the way.

2446	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This book is designed to initiate the average reader who lives outside the beltway into some of the most important dimensions of the federal budget crisis --both as to today as well as looking into the future.  The authors are quite skillful in using charts and illustrations, and a sometimes humorous approach, to discuss these concepts.  And it is a sobering topic to be sure, since it involves Medicare, Social Security, the national debt, deficits, and other cheery topics. One only need read the second chapter ("So what's the worse that come happen?") to get scared out of their socks.  That is, are we in year X (which is not too far away) going to be in a situation where the entire federal budgetary income can only be spent on Medicare, Social Security, a bit for national defense, and the rest to cover interest payments on the national debt? The authors take the reader step by step through what are the problems, how they developed into a serious crisis, some often mentioned but not realistic proposed solutions, and the defects of the political system which have contributed to the situation. For even those of us who live within the beltway, there is much to be learned from the book.  For example, I was not aware that fully 34.8% of the federal budget income is derived from payments into Social Security, Medicare and other federal insurance programs.  Unlike regular income from taxes, at some point in the future this increment will have to be paid back when those systems need the money.  Multiply this figure times a decade or two and you begin to see the problem.  About as palatable an introduction to this topic as one is likely to encounter.
My one critique, if I were to have any, would be that at times he expounds too much on areas that need little expansion.  He goes to great lengths to flesh out each and every move these characters make, and the prose spans over a good length of time, and so some scenes could have been cut and some time could have been shortened to keep the pacing a little brisker in areas, but in the end it is a trivial complaint when you consider the richly rewarding entirety of the novel.  I felt that the novel's ending was a tad premature (even if the novel spans nearly 500 pages), but it was not a disappointment in the least; it just felt a little too sudden for what I was expecting.





Like Banville's narrators in other novels, the elderly Axel Vander of Shroud is unreliable and often dishonest, self-concerned but not self-aware. Consummately venal, he blithely takes advantage of whatever circumstances arise. Cass Cleave, the daughter of Alexander Cleave, the narrator of Banville's previous novel, Eclipse, has visions and seizures, and Vander regards her as mad, but she and Vander develop a relationship of almost religious significance. He is depraved and amoral, and she is a sick, avenging angel.
Although she trusts Gage, Hailey is nevertheless slow to trust his feelings for her as anything more than transient.  But having gotten her attention with some really great sex, Gage easily wins her heart with his unending patience and the ways he shows her how much she means to him as a person and friend, instead of just a bed partner.

Throughout the book, there are a lot of comments similar to ". . .as you progress on the spiritual path, you begin to see/feel/experience X/Y/Z, etc."  I have personally experienced many of these, as he says them to be true.  Some examples: as you begin to achieve a higher level of consciousness: you feel more secure and positive about yourself, you exist in peace with others, you drop the habits of criticizing and complaining, life is no longer a competition "me" against "them", obsessive and compulsive thoughts lose their grip, negative thoughts are replaced by positive ones, you improve the atmosphere around you (by your presence), and many many more.

Abagnale's recounting of his nightmarish stint in a French prison almost redeemed the nonchalance of his playboy lawlessness. And make no mistake, this is a book of self-aggrandizement. Despite that, it is a highly addictive read--Abagnale is as charming on paper as he must have been in person. You can't help but smile at some of the stunts he gets away with, although I was mortified at his tenure as a pediatrician (that may just be the new father in me). Still, for all the womanizing and bamboozling, CMIYC is the story of a dumb kid who was too smart for his own good, who started a scam as a lark but found himself painted into a corner with no way out but to keep going before he finally hit bottom. While his antics are infuriating, you still want to cheer him on.

Just like the Phillip Marlowe novels which brought Chandler his well deserved fame, these hardboiled shorter works are characterized by great dialogue and very effective descriptive passages.  Reading this collection gives one an appreciation for the intelligence and craftsmanship Raymond Chandler applied to his writing.  Highly recommended.

Synopsis: All horror films have that scene - the one where the scary music is playing and the stupid girl continues to walk through the house looking for the bad guy when any sane person would run as fast as they could. Dumb Blonde tells one girl's story of shadows in windows, scary music playing, and nobody believing her.
It is written in the first person - a challenge on its own, especially in such a detailed and driven story. The main character is engaging and human and it is impossible not to root for her at every stage. Something that I truly appreciated throughout the story was the connection between the main character and Ann Frank. At first I thought Francisco would have a difficult time making a clear and useful connection with Ann Frank, but my concern was proven wrong. This connection was deeply important and gives much meaning to the story. It is another world war, and the main character is very human, lonely (even though she is always surrounded by people), driven to care about others and her family, and the main character is somewhat nave, just as Frank would have been, considering her age.

Highly recommend.

Even though he intends this novel to register on a state and even regional level, Baxter maintains the story's focus on its title characters and on their "plain old married love." It has an amiably small, domestic scope, which certainly is no limitation, especially in the hands of a writer who is as fearlessly playful and fiercely intelligent as Baxter. Rather, SAUL AND PATSY is wonderfully and magically life-size.

Dakota won't sell out her land to "Big Ed" no matter what he throws at her. Through fires, attacks and even stolen cattle she has held strong.  Heck the man even hired her former "boyfriend" away.  She has grown leery of people, especially as no one in town will help her.  When Joe and Colt show up on her property looking for work she tries to send them on their way.  Once they figure out she is the one standing alone against "Big Ed" they decide to take only yes for an answer.
Devil's Lair includes Latin and rarely used vocabulary words, as well as references to historical figures, ancient writings and philosophers, discussions of morality and ethics, and yet it moves forward quickly with a fast-paced plot, continuous action and complicated characters.  In the style of the best literature, it turns out that each character is on their own individual journey in addition to the overall journey of the group, and each must face their own demons.  Devil's Lair is an exquisitely written novel.
While people may be able to argue specific points, the overall book is fantastic and incredibly wise.  Even though my family has always used credit cards to get the rewards associated with them and pay them off each month, Dave Ramsey's absolutely adamant opposition to their use does make sense and has caused me to question our usage.  If nothing else, he sure makes you think!

As a first in a lengthy series, The Ritual Bath is a good introduction for the reader.  We learn about the characters.  Who they are, what their value systems and beliefs are, and how they meet. This back story is essential in understanding their motivations.  If you like serial writing and enjoy the familiarity of characters and settings, this story is a good place to start.

She wants to be free, away from his hot hands, his grasping and his hurting. No one sees, no one hears, no one does anything to help her. If she dares save herself, what is the cost?

Nina Blackman is one of those people who wallows.  She wallows in how poor she is.  She wallows in her history.  She wallows in her absolute misery with herself and who and what she is.  And this is before she was turned into a vampire.  She knows she is a miserable creature.  She knows she is absolutely miserable.  She knows she visits this same misery upon everybody who comes into contact with her.  How do I know this?  Because she goes on and on and on about it interminably.
Slowly the other pages and teachers learn to respect Aislinn for her unyielding determination in tackling her challenges.  Aislinn struggles with her emotions as well as her mental and physical training. As she matures she also has to struggle with conflicting desires between her dream to be a lady knight and her growing feelings and friendship with Prince Caelan who is destined to be married for political and royal position.

There is nothing new here.  Carr, by his own admission, draws a lot of his material from Black Mass: the True Story of an Unholy Alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill.  The major investigative work was done by the Boston Globe's Spotlight Team and reported in the 1988 series, The Bulger Mystique.  Reading the Globe's online articles about Bulger will give the interested reader more detail than Carr's book.

Diaz also gives the reader a great deal about the Dominican Republic and the sort of seething anger which surely grows out of being from a small country that is at once under the thumb of a superpower, yet about which the people of the aforementioned superpower are almost entirely ignorant.  Again, he accomplishes this in a way that, supported by the strong cables of his sense of humor, never descends to preaching.  His characters continue to be interesting throughout, even as we can pretty much guess from the title where the book is heading.

  Maddox has a dark past, one that still haunts him.  Iris offers him an oasis, a healing touch in the midst of the tropical island.  But will Maddox allow himself to accept that he is worthy of Iris and her love? Maddox is one of my favorite types of heroes in a romance, one of those tortured heroes who focuses on the individuals he couldn't save.  His heroism reached through the pages as his pain grabbed my heart and twisted.  I wanted Maddox to have his happily-ever-after (HEA) and Iris was the perfect one to give it to him.

TRADING IN DANGER starts slowly as Ky deals with her rejection at the academy, her first command (almost babysat by extremely senior crewmen and crewwomen) and her grandmother's notorious fruitcake. Once mercenaries attack the system where she is taking on cargo and intersystem communications are lost, the pace picks up as Ky is forced to deal with irrational crewmen, mercenaries who would as soon shoot as ask questions, and passengers who have their own ideas of what to do and aren't ready to take Ky's decisions as final.

9848	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	It is the year 1349, deep in the Middle Ages still. The plague is killing scores of people all over Europe. The Pope is in Avignon, France, a corrupt individual; the world is enslaved by the Devil. He is now the owner of the Holy Grail, a stone cup once filled with the blood of Christ on the cross. The Devil has hidden it, deep down in Hell, in his lair. Four lovable characters, a poet, a kind of a monk, a knight and a girl who has visions embark on a journey to retrieve the Grail and save the world. They use Dante's Inferno as their roadmap so-to-speak. Lair is easy to read, though - or because - the prose is lyrical, rich and downright enchanted, and because the book really has a story to tell. I thoroughly enjoyed it, Latin and all.

I particularly liked the intrigue of this book better. I got caught up in the  mystery as it unraveled (though I saw the younger brother's situation from a mile off... I think the revelation of that could have been planned better). I think the highest praise comes in the form of how the author treats the Native American influence. She presents it well but doesn't feel the need to invent things about the culture if she doesn't know anything about them (as a native man I am particularly sensitive to how natives are portrayed in novels/media) so job well done on that count alone.

4370	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	2.0	I think there might be a very good story buried in this book.  However, a great deal more editing is needed to find it.  It suffers greatly from wordiness.  Let me back up my critique with examples: At one point Elyssa reached into her pocket and "pulled out a handkerchief she had earlier placed there."  How else did the handkerchief get there?  She also walked over to her porch swing "that was hung out there."  How could she walk to a swing that wasn't there?  We are told in one short paragraph that the heroine's father died suddenly, unexpectedly and prematurely from a heart attack.  Shouldn't the reader be allowed to infer all these things just by mentioning his death with barely grown children, or his age at the time?  The author seems afraid to let the reader make their own conclusions, even obvious ones.

I'm going to talk about the world building initially rather than the characters as I think the concept was pretty unique. Vampires actually originated from the technologically advanced, ancient Atlantis. They combined nanotechnology with bioengineering. These nanos which live inside their bodies require blood to keep the vampires in optimum condition. Vampires aren't allergic to the sun but it does mean the nanos have to work a bit harder to repair them and need more blood. It kept sparking memories of the epic science fiction show "Red Dwarf" which featured recalcitrant nanos.
The tasks that Will must perform are difficult and arduous, both mentally and physically, and the weed that Will is given genuinely seems to help him get through it all. That is what makes drug addiction so insidious. No one chooses to become addicted, they feel like they genuinely need it in order to get through their lives and before they know it, they cant live without it. This is never expressly stated but it is there and some readers may be shocked at such a portrayal.

1931	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	The third volume of this immensely popular fantasy series for the younger (and, umm, slightly older) reader is as much fun, as much action, as much excitement and drama as the preceding two volumes combined.  Given the epic, brilliant, overwhelming cliff hanger type nature of the ending to book two, however, ICEBOUND LAND opens up in a way that, it must be said, is relatively timid.  Sure, Halt and Co are all worried sick about the plight and welfare of Will and young Evanlyn as they are hijacked by some of the storys baddies, and led (presumably) into a life of depraved, mind bending and back breaking slavery, but the two young characters in question are not showing all that much physical or emotional hardship over the matter.

Secondly, I also challenge her to look into a faith in God that she may be holding back.  It seems she was tempted to attribute the 'coincidental' occurences in the book to Him, but she held herself back by only saying 'someone' was looking out for the main characters.  Of the couple times that she mentions God by name, one is at a moment to blame Him for what 'went wrong' and another is to reduce Him to a buffet style God that one can pull apart for the pieces that are convenient to us.  And with this again, I challenge her to be different.

At this time in history Japanese forces have overrun much of coastal China and are pushing toward southeast Asia.  The sensei is actually in Malaya as an agent to prepare the way for their forces to invade.  The Japanese have developed a European model of conquest to their bushido code of duty to become the masters of their part of the world.  The question for the conflicted teenager is how he can save his family from the rapacity of the Japanese war machine without completely dishonoring his own cultures.  This conflict plays out throughout the novel.  It is a Hobsons choice, with no good answer, but it provides a fine vehicle for examining the questions and cultures involved, much as The Nightengale did for German-occupied France.

8641	Kindle_Store_5	NEG	1.0	Wow!  What a total waste of my money and time.  I assume this was self-published?  Does the author not have a few friends capable of proofreading the book for her?  I didn't get past the first 5 or 6 pages on my kindle.  Multiple unintelligible sentences in a row was too much for me.  I was trying to ignore the messy and poor writing, but when it reaches the point where you can't even guess what the sentence was supposed to be, it's time to give up.

1060	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	What can I say?  Here are all the stories by one of the greatest writers in the English language.  Love them all.
Anyway, Wildwood Dancing, for me, is the type of book that is worth staying up all night to finish (which I did, against the influence of some pretty heavy medications...) My first time reading, there were parts that caught me so off guard that I literally screamed. Wildwood Dancing will certainly not collect dust on my bookshelf, and I recommend it to anyone, young and old, looking for a dreamy romantic fairy-tale. And I would also rec commend reading other books by Juliet Marillier, especially Daughter of the Forest.
I was delighted in reading the book to find the word "highfalutin" in the text.  The world seems somehow to be a more charming place for the unexpected presence of such a light-hearted word in the midst of a serious text.
7728	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	This book looks like a good start to a exciting series. Never ending excitement along with never ending murders. I am looking forward to the next book.
A man finds his wife stark naked in the bed of another man just hours after she tells him that she wants a divorce and that she's in love with someone else, and that she's going to him. The 'other man' (who happens to be her best friend) all but brags to the husband (Patrizio) that he slept with his wife (Keira), and Keira backs up his story. Of course he is going to be angry, bitter, and resentful. Of course he is going to lash out. If he didn't, he would've seemed like a cuckolded weakling, and I would've really hated that.

I was hooked from the moment I started reading the story.  Duke and Viola are charismatic, interesting characters and the dynamic created between them was fascinating.  The story was exciting, with a ton of twists and turns.  It had magic and intrigue, betrayal and loyalty from unexpected places.  There was pain and there was humor.  Aggie, Duke's grandmother, is one of my favorite characters in the book, being everything to Viola that her own family was not.  This was one of those books that you fell into and felt as if you were a part of the story.  I definately recommend clicking one of those "buy it" links above and picking it up!
The first-person narrative pulls readers in quickly and introduces them to the action and the world effortlessly.  I like the humor, the puns and the jokes, a lot.  It fits the characters perfectly.  And now, with Ravirn's mysterious future slightly more clear, I can't wait to see where the third book takes him.  I'm definitely going along for the trip when the book comes out.
2858	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Beautifully written! I will read it again.
I can't recommend these books strongly enough.  I would also strongly recommend reading them in order.  That order would be (year of original publication noted - though the books themselves take place in the space of only a year or two):


4274	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I read this to my 6 year old daughter and she just loved it! Winnie the Pooh has such wonderful characters for little children. I loved how this book made my daughter laugh! I also love how I didn't have to worry about language in the book. Each chapter is a short story of Pooh's adventure.


4061	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	Great plot and new ideas . The characters are consistent and believable. The suspense is phenomenal and the pace just right to keep you wondering but not ever bored.
Levin also argues against other things that many American's cherish, like the right to privacy. True, there is no explicit right to privacy granted in the Constitution, but that doesn't mean it isn't an implied right, intended by the nation's founders. Surveys show that the majority of Americans feel that privacy is a right and should be Constitutionally protected. Levin feels it is not a right and that the Supreme Court should not treat it as such. It's interesting how the book so Levin so quickly changes his position on democracy and the importance of upholding the will of the people when they vote something into law. If a vote of the people confirms the right to privacy, one would think that someone like Levin would agree that it should be made into law. But based on his other convictions in this book, he would likely be against it, in direct contradiction of some of his other stands on the issues and the Supreme Court's authority to decide them.

6323	Kindle_Store_5	POS	4.0	Found this book through one of my LinkedIn groups and thought the synopsis was good.  This book is well written with action that moves quickly and keeps you reading well into the night.  The premise is a fresh take on apocalyptic conspiracies.  The characters are complex and involving, making you care what happens to them. And there are unexpected twists that will have you on edge. Although set well into the future, the events are plausible and a little frightening.  I can't wait to read the next book.  Kudos to Michael Rusch for a great novel.


This was the same woman who has written The Bride and The Secret and so many other funny, warm, poignant romances with great alpha heroes and quirky fun heroines. I have read and re-read all of her early paperbacks from the 80s and 90s. She's on keeper shelf.
Many papers translate poorly to the kindle, like Newsday rival NY Post or just cost too much like the Baltimore Sun and Wall Street Journal, but Newsday works well and is priced right.
History has shown us, that much of this information is inaccurate (China, Russia, Cuba,...); and that communism is a great way to make people lazy, and caught up in paperwork.

Suetonius had first hand knowledge of many of the Caesars who followed the Claudians, and ready access to the archives of the imperial family and the Senate, given his imperial posting.
4365	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	I love modern retellings of Pride and Prejudice. While there are some differences in events between Louise's novel and Austen's it does not take away from the novel. I seriously could not put down this book and read it in a day! Louise's spin on events is creative and captivating. From William's ingenious way of handling Elyssa's anger towards him to his oh-so-romantic proposal the reader is taken in and events seem to come full circle. One thing I love is when an author takes events at the beginning of the book and they are referenced or mirrored with events towards the end. Louise is great at this in all of her novels I have read thus far. The emotions I felt while reading Drive and Determination went right along with what the characters'. There were times I teared up, became exasperated, laughed, and swooned. Louise is also remarkable at creating sexual tension and romance between her two main characters all while keeping on their clothes and not at all indecent. This entire book was a delight! You really must read this book, especially if you loved Darcy's Voyage like so many others have!

- I liked Kasey's brother, Garrett, quite a bit. He's flashy and flamboyant with a "devil take it" attitude, yet he also knows when to be serious and is very protective of his twin.


Did I mention, I LOVE THIS BOOK!!  Thank you, Sue Monk Kidd!

from the first chapter when the aged hero is asked "where is your family" and he says "they are all dead"; you know this is a book of a tragedy. and one by one it the deaths unfold. But first you get to know them as they were and remain in the heros mind.  So this is a book of Memories, and it even says at one point, memories are all we have, once we are old.
4609	Kindle_Store_5	POS	5.0	While this novel takes some liberty with some aspects of occupation, it is very carefully research and makes  war history told acurately. It is a spell binding read.
Of course there are numerous misunderstandings, especially including George Westham. My favorite parts are when "Lizzy" and "Will" play in the water by the shore in Guatemala, when Will is taking care of "Elisabeth" when she is taken ill, and when they meet again in Chicago at the Coffee plant. The book is a page turner for sure and I had a hard time putting it down. I like Kara Louise's story telling skills, which is even more noticable in her book "Pemberley's Promise", which is my favorite Pride & Prejudice variation to date.
