Pros:
I'm amazed that you can buy the actual Blackberry OEM skin for such a low cost on Amazon.  Verizon sells these for much more in the stores.  The skin is so useful and a great value, that whenever I need a free shipping filler, I plan on getting any other color I can find.  Great skin for my Verizon Blackberry 8330.
Cons -
Con's
This product would be 5 stars in my book if the volume was louder.  Note that volume *level* is controlled by either the phone or the unit, but the volume *output* is limited by the unit' amp and speaker.  For all but the absolute quietest situations, the volume is simply not loud enough for reliable use in a car.  Even sitting on my desk as a speakerphone, the volume is insufficient if there is any level of background noise.

2)  Reception is good and internet is fast.
I looked on Otterbox's site but did not find a replacement skin if it gets worn. I will have to email them about that.
Cons: but only lasted 3 months and it fell apart.
4. Very good audio quality on receive, with ample volume available.
-Voice commands work (the actual voice recognition is done by the Blackberry)

3) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck, wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back. Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.

If you have an older house, this isn't a problem, but we just spent a lot of money to have all of our windows replaces with low-e glass to save on energy costs, which means we can't make much use of this signal booster.
I purchased a second one and if this one lasts 1yr I'll be content as well as I'm a bit hard on them (hitting it on the arms of chairs when I stand up or sit down.)

This phone does already have a successor (I should have reviewed this a year ago) with a newer operating system and without that annoying antenna on the top.  When my contract is up, I'll more than likely go that route unless I decide to go with a smaller phone and carry around a PDA.  But right now you can pick this phone up at a bargain of a price compared to that other one and lose very little functionality.  So I'd suggest you do your homework and see if the newer one is worth the few hundred dollars you'd be plopping down for it.
RF is fine

Summary:
-Only connects to one BT device at a time. I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere. With these two devices I cannot have the H700 connect simultaneously (other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.
It DOES NOT convert voltage to 110. Make sure everything you plug into it can handle 220 or the magic smoke will get out and your device will no longer work.

Sound a quality is as good if not better than the H500 And the H700 has some better features than the H500 now if it would only I can listen to my MP3 sounds from it with my Razor it would be that much better
6414	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say about this -- for such a cheap price, I was skeptical, but what the heck I gave it a shot.  It snapped onto my camera quickly and easily; can't tell it isn't the original.  When I break it again, I'll buy it again!

Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders,
OK. My review...
If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low. I'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.
3606	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Feels great.  Looks like burning man.  I would use it more, but I switched to the high capacity battery and now don't use it.
I'm not sure I'll buy another.  The device had decent sound quailty except when a slight breeze would cause it to cut out.  Other headsets transmit a static sound, this model just cuts off when the wind sound occurs.  I'm back to searching for a decent noise canceling headset again.

The company told me I could "gently" bend the loops to fit my ear better.  They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds.  They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping).

I thought of purchasing AT&T prepaid sim card which can be used with AT&T Go Phones. In AT&T store it is 10$. Here is on Amazon, i purchased it under 4$. It worked good and every month I just load it with 10$, no contract, no hefty bills. I liked this very much as I can have a permanent AT&T number for just 10$ a month. I have been using this since last 7 months

5532	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This really is a useful set of tools for your ATT Tilt. The charging/USB port cradle works great -- just plug your phone in, and it starts the syncing process while it charges your battery. You can also charge the extra battery in the back of the unit, so you will nearly always have a freshly charged battery ready. You almost don't need the included car charger! Since this is a touch screen, the cleaning cloth and screen protector help keep the screen easy to read. This is about everything you will need for your Tilt, except for a carrying case.
8655	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Phone case seems durable, looks great, What it shows is what you get. No screen cover so don't expect one!! (I didn't but I can see who might).

9194	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This battery pack will charge your iphone several times.  It is compact and easy to carry in your briefcase.  It doesn't plug directly into the iphone so you will need to also carry a charging cord.  The unit is very solid and I would recommend it.

Unless they come out with something that just looks a whole lot better or has longer battery life with the same features, I am sticking with this one.
8262	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is what the Dr. ordered. No need looking any further. It's bulky but, un-stylish vs buying a new phone cause it was not protected. Give me the ugly.

I'm going on vacation to Disney shortly and this device should keep my phone functioning all day in the parks as well as keep one of the Ereader powered for some game playing while we wait in lines.  Update: As I updated above I connected the IMP500 while sitting in line and it extended the readers to run all day.


Some info about the unit:
1st edit: this headphones DOES NOT support AVRCP (play/pause, prev, next), if you plan to use it on your laptop without audio adaptor, get the one for ipod (grey) instead

The thing seems to hold charge for ever - I haven't had to recharge it in two weeks.

9530	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When I first opened it I was skeptical, thinking it looked like snake oil.  I installed it according to the directions anyway, hoping against my better judgement that it would actually work as advertised.  I installed it on a telephone pole with the small antenna in the corner of my living room, in an area where I generally have no signal or 1 bar maximum.  Now I have 4-5 bars throughout my (small) house, and can make rock solid calls where before it was impossible.

If you want to run with these things, that is even funnier.  The earbuds will slide out over and over again.  They will prevent you from concentrating on the music while running because of the infuriating frustration they bring while wearing them.

3025	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	*** UPDATE TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW*** After using this phone for over 9 months now I thought I would update the review and actually increase the rating to 3.5 stars (from 2.5).  The original review with its criticism still stands but I recently tried the Sony-Erriccson w300i and that has made me appreciate this phone more.  Despite its big and bulky (and somewhat unnatractive) looks, this phone has held up pretty well and offers a lot more than the Sony w300i. Definately a better purchase than the Sony... and both can be had for free from ATT.  A quick summary of the Plus points that make this better than the Sony... Better camera, better internal and external screens, better buttons, better music player visuals, uses micro sd which is easy to find and cheap.
The only reason I'm not rating this headset 5 stars is that I agree with other reviews, the earpiece doesn't fit that snuggly in the ear. This is a minor complaint for me though as the headset does pretty much what I want it to do and it does it nicely.
Well, back to the search for a product that will charge with the case still on!
Of course, everyone wants to know how it performs.  I have tested it solely with my iPhone 4, and have found it completely charges the product from 0% to 100%, and the status indicator shows it still contains enough power to recharge my iPhone again.  I would estimate you could charge your device at least 2 1/2 times before the battery itself would need to be recharged.
Funky color for me

Three days after receiving this weBoost Drive, we were on our way to "dead cell zone of North America".  I decided to use it in the car then move it to the Travel Trailer when we arrived.  Normally we loose cell service many times on the way, then all service goes dead 2 miles from camping area.  Our 8 hour drive was a good test of this device in the car, we NEVER lost signal.  Even in the areas through the mountains we normally drop for 10-30 minutes at a time, we had very good signal strength.  This device delivered signal in the car and all the way to our camp site with only 2 drops in cell service as we entered a mountain range and still had 1 bar signal in Jeep at camp site.
5895	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This little gem came as a package deal with the Trent iCarrier. It doesn't have the same capacity as the iCarrier but it's not as heavy or as bulky either. The iTorch easily fits in a pocket. I always have one or the other with me when I'm away from home.
My recommendation- despite its limitations I believe that the Treo 700w is the best business phone out there. The new Iphone is nice- but it will not link to my Outlook account... and that is a deal killer for me. Therefore, I give a thumbs-up to the Treo 700w, but I can not wait for the next generation!

1619	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	First the negative:  Occasionally it fails to pair with my Nokia phone, the phone sees the headset but the headset won't communicate with the phone, requiring both to be reset.  It is also slightly bulky behind the ear and could be more comfortable with glasses.
5) Light sensing.  I've always thought it was a waste of battery for a keyboard to lit up in the middle of the day, this phone has the ability to sense light and will turn on the back-lit numpad if its dark.

1679	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I'm in the pro-V188 camp.  I think it's a solid, good-quality cell phone.  The color screen is a bit small compared to more expensive phones, but hey, you get this for free before the generous rebate, so stop bitching about this not being a high-end phone, for it's not meant to be a high-end phone.  It has good reception and voice quality, and is built rather like a tank: solid, durable, a little on the thick side.  If you want something stylish go with a RAZR or PEBL or SLVR.  If you want something small and lasts forever, go with a Sanyo PCS phone for Sprint.  But the V188 is a good basic phone, no doubt about that.
1439	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The quality is good and received it within the promised time period. It could fit a little better but it's comfortable. It's probably because my ear canal is as big as the Panama Canal but oh well. I pair it to two phones everyday and it works great with both. Everyone can hear me clearly and loudly. The top part that molds is very pliable but almost too much. I wish it could hold it's form better but it doesn't it just goes back to it's original mold. Good product, I just have odd ears.

Cord will slip out of the juice pack battery with no-notice
Also, it's definitely scarred the interior on the car's carpeted ceiling.  There's nothing anyone could do about that, and I'd rather have two circular scars on my ceiling than my backseat ruined by my dogs.
Device includes a built in red laser and led lights, and comes with a carrying pouch.

Hard to imagine how it could possibly fall off as reported in some other reviews.  Seems very secure to me.  (but I believe them- I guess the product plastic must have broken)

Update: 6/12/06

Call me old fashion, but maybe someone can tell me how others use this as a phone and think this is the best phone ever? I waited almost 5 year to upgrade to the "Best palm phone" for over $600 and I got nothing but inconvenience and no entertainment value. Best of luck for those out there can't wait to get you hands on this phone. I would pick the HP 6315 from T-Mobile if their service wasn't sucks in NJ.

Our old batteries needed to be charged every 3 days and if connected to bluetooth when placing a call, we were lucky to make one quick call before needed a recharge.  Just having the bluetooth on would also drain the battery to low battery in 8 hours.

6603	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My area of the office had ZERO reception. After using this, I now have good reception (including my 3 office partners who sit within 15-20 feet from me). My 3G doesn't always work reliably on this but phone reception is good. I would buy it again if ever needed
6636	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Our cell coverage with Consumer Cellular uses the Doro 618 "flip-phone" - primative but serves our needs well.  We live about 3 miles as the crow flies from the nearest tower (an AT & T) and our cell service has been spotty with few bars and too many dropped calls.  After exploring options (satellite and mifi) we decided to take advantage of the 30-day trial period and get this Wilson unit to see if it would boost our existing service.  It did!  I mounted the antenna on a pvc pole on the roof and ran the coax cable just under the roof line, down the corner of the house, and into the kitchen at floor level through a hole I drilled in the wall.  I did have to use both the 20' AND the 30' lengths of cable that were supplied with the unit (using the connector that was also supplied) and had just enough cable to get inside the kitchen.  When I plugged everything in the inside booster unit showed two green lights immediately and the cell phone showed a solid 4/4 bars.  I did not have to adjust the "gain" buttons at all on the booster (I'm not sure how or when I'd need to do that anyway), and as long as I have two green lights and 4 bars I won't monkey with them.  We use two identical cell phones and have 4 bars now throughout our 1200 sq ft home (the kitchen is right in the middle of the home), so even though it's touted as a "small home/room" booster it works very well throughout our entire house.
1745	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This Bluetooth 1.2 version has since been replaced by the newer generation, but the price of this model has come down by nearly $80 as a result.  I've used them for working out in front of a TV (if you equip your set with an inexpensive 3.5 mm audio out jack), listening to iPod, portable dvd player in the car, and computer.  Pros: The sound is quite clear and true, provided you aren't an overly demanding audiophile. The single charger has a Y-shaped adapter end permitting charging of both the adapter and headset simultaneously. Cons: they are considerably heavier than corded headphones and become a bit uncomfortable after an hour.

6127	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've gone through several backup battery solutions over the past few years and all suffer from either a lack of power or were ridiculously large.  The iTorch has in the short time I've owned it proven it's worth.  I've recharged my Nexus 4 from 14% remaining to full and then topped off my Nexus 7 from 36% with no issues, then had a friend ask if she could borrow it, allowing her to get a good extra bit of charging on her iPhone.
This is must-have item if you ever are traveling or anywhere where power supplies are limited. I highly recommend this product.
Cons:
Also, I thought I could only get Yahoo.  Silly me.  I have several URL Favorites saved (Yahoo, MSN, BBC, GOOGLE, MAPQUEST, SUPERPAGES).  You can store up to 10 URL's.  I check my Yahoo and MSN mail easily (but I can't open attachments).  There seem to be more MP3 ringtones available to me with this phone.  As for games, I guess they're updating constantly.  Pac-Man wasn't available when I first got the phone, but it is now.  I'm just waiting for my Backgammon to be available on this phone.  I also like that you can turn the calendar "on" and have it display on your wallpaper.  Turn it "off" and you just have your wallpaper photo.  Yes, you can make your own photos your wallpaper too.  Yes, you can have different ringtones and photos for each caller.
Qwerty keyboard

The unit worked as intended.  The size of the powerpak is near perfect as it can easily fit into your pocket or bag / carry on without taking up a lot of space.  It is also nice that the iTorch utilizes the phones existing usb charge cable so that additional cables and adapters are not necessary.

608	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.


I suggest this product with full 5 star rating.

5323	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've got over 500 running miles using the Switcheasy with no problems.  This product has a few unique features that the others don't have.

9801	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works great but thicker than the original of battery model
7593	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works great as advertised.  I've used it several times in Europe with different plugs.. all worked...  I'd recommend it..
FYI, I get 1/2 a charge on my iPad from this device and a full charge on my ipod.
2607	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	did not look like what I wanted but will keep it
5447	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It's made of elastic. I was expecting something a little more durable.
That being said, I also like to be as animated as possible when I talk so holding a phone is a nightmare for me. in the middle of a conversation about the most mundane subject, data processing, I'll launch my phone right out of the window! I must use my entire being to express my words, and holding a phone ties me down. Not to mention the danger for pedestrians. Out of nowhere, SMACK, a cell phone hits them in the face. Not cool. i choose this holder over throwing phones at peoples faces any day of the week. Plus, I don't get tickets now.
39	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	soooo cute! I got many complaints when I had this cover.  I took the gems off at the bottom of the case since texting made it hard.  After awhile, the gems started to peel off..but it still looked cute!
4201	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	On a relative scale (comparing to other headsets), I would rate this 5 stars.  Its at the top of the heap in actual performance. On an absolute scale, I only gave it 4 stars because there is still room for improvement.
Now with this unit and new phone and new service area (yes, probably other contributers to my problem) when I made calls/or received, I would be told that people i am speaking with hear an echo of their conversation coming back to them. I have been adjusting the volume on the car but I don't think that is really helping. Shows me that the mic isn't made for this and doesn't cut out (Half-duplex) when the other parties are talking.
Customizable-  The blackberry curve is a very customizable you can change the themes that change how the phone looks and there are alot out there on the internet.  Some you have to pay for and others are free but there are alot of good free themes out there... Ask me for a website and I will tell you where to find them but there could be changes like being able to make it so you don't have to have icons on your desktop at all times which is something I would really appreciate.  3 and a half stars for not having the possibility of taking icons of your desktop but yet having the option to download themes.


7734	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this for a while and it has worked well.  It is easy to lose the rubber ear piece and it is hard to find if you do.  It is also impossible to find a replacement.  Otherwise, it has had no problems and sounds good, is comfortable, and has good battery life.
Unfortunately, the ClearBoost antenna is designed to work best with the 850 mHz band. It may have some small improvements for 1900 mHz signal, but not much compared to 850 mHz signals. Griffin says that ATT uses the 850 mHz band in most parts of the US. But Tucson appears to be all 1900 mHz. I tried the ClearBoost at Nemo's house, about five miles due west of my location, only to find that his area uses the 1900 mHz band, as well.
One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.




This smarphone is a real gem in my opinion.

8283	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	First time I have a char charger and now I wish I had gotten it sooner. I don't have to worry about charging my phone overnight. I always can plug it in my car (I drive a lot during the day)
6250	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works well.  Plenty of power for my iPhone 4s.  And the number of adapters is great.  It charges my Kindle Fire also.
4988	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Another bad part of the iphone is regular headphones just don't fit.
Pros:
479	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	nice
remedy: disconnect the stereo headset before open up realplayer, connect it back once the player starts playing, do it every time the phone restarts
4. It takes about an hour and a half, but if you are lucky like me, you can get it taken care of.
The product worked
5137	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I purchased this for working at home, communicating with customers. This is exactly what I needed and my life has improved drastically since I purchased it. I have had no sound complaints from the other end. I have found that I cannot even leave the room without the handset without hearing loud static, so I make sure to keep the handset nearby or clipped on. I also notice a very small amount of static (on my end only) when plugging something into the wall or using the microwave. The batter lasts me about 8 hours, so if I work an exceptionally long day, I have to find another source. Overall, this works exactly as I need it to. The headset is so comfortable I barely notice it, and I have never been able to wear over-the-ear headsets comfortably.


Next up was Metro, it too didn't offer a solution.  I was bummed and had finally given up when I was driving and saw a random hole-in-the-wall cell phone place. I figured one more [final] try can't hurt.  Walked in and immediately, him:  "oh you have a Firefly, I haven't seen those in years."  It felt like I heard angels singing and bright lights shining down on this young man.  Me: "I love you!"  lol

Music stops when I get a text, but won't start again until I get my phone out and look at the message (or tell my phone I don't want to look at it now) -- I find this to be the biggest bummer, but I don't know if it's just my model of phone.


1670	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This unit works! I had 2 Motorola bluetooth headsets and I was about to give up on bluetooth headses altogether. This one sounds good in the car for both the listener to whom I am talking to and for myself. In fact it actually sounds better than pressing the phone up to my ear. It can be loud as well which is good and bad. The good is when you have a lot of background noise, this thing can be heard. The bad, is it can be really loud!


-  Sometimes turning on the laser pointer instead of turning off the device is little bit confusing.
I have left my original review (of a defective unit) below and original update below for transparency.
- Needs at least 1 gig of internal memory - the current version is woefully underpowered.
9666	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	New old stock (circa 2015) but not too old ... works fine ... cheap price ... package says made in USA ...

Seems well made.
8410	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I RECEIVED APPLE PHONE HOLDER THANK YOU BARGAINCELL FOR HAVING THIS ITEM I REALLY NEEDED I PUT ON MY CAR AND IS HANDS OFF MY PHONE.

7466	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	have used this product numerous times with computer to connect different devices. would recommend to friends and family, good customer service
446	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I drive a company-supplied vehicle, so alterations to the dash are out-of-the question.  As long as the cord is not interfering with gravity (run under the bean bag) this will hold up for all but the most extreme driving.
There's no flex in the thing.  I can practically sit on it.  I think I can bounce it off a marble floor too.  I also like how the keypad is covered so I don't mind replying to messages while my hands are dirty.  I highly recommend this to anyone that works in rugged environments.  If you're in the military, law enforcement, a contractor, even just in a sports recreation environment like camping, mountain biking, climbing, etc, I highly recommend this Otterbox case.
FAIL

Pros:
- Wished the buttons were on the bottom part of the phone instead of on the cover. Though if you put a lock on the ring settings you do not have to worry about hitting the keys by accident.
1075	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II. I So love this phone. There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.
Installation: There are three recommended ways to install the "outside" antenna: (1) inside of a window (there are suction cups), (2) attached to a pole, ideally on the roof, and (3) attached to the building's rafters. It comes with detailed instructions, but there are a few things that are worth knowing about before you purchase. The "outside" antenna needs to be connected, via a cord (included in 20ft and 30ft lengths that can be connected for a 50ft length, if needed) to the DT, which needs to be connected to the "inside" antenna, which needs to be plugged in to a surge protector. The "outside" antenna needs to be at least 20ft away from the DT, and the inside antenna needs to be at least 18 inches from the DT.

8049	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Looks Nice, its a little difficult to put it on the phone but protects it good. I can recomend it.
4) Minimalism:  There is a certain sexy minimalism about a sleek black phone that doesn't do *anything* except make phone calls.
Summary:

1768	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This headset fits so comfortably on my ear and I especially like that I can use either ear. I can hear so much better with the Jabra than the expensive Motorola headset I had that was always falling off my ear.  In fact I was using the Motorola talking with my son, in a lot of pain and needing help.  When I turned my head, it fell off and out of reach.  My son called an ambulance when he could no longer hear me. My elderly Mom says she can hear me better on this headset too.
Not as much volume as the Moto.


Jawbone-the best one yet- can't wait until the next generation comes out.
My first power test showed a weak result, but I think that is not unusal for the first 1-2 times you charge most portable batteries.
7176	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	works great

2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own.
On one hand, it sounds pretty good. The speakers get plenty loud. The microphone was outstanding. People I spoke with claimed that they couldn't tell I was using a speakerphone, even when I was driving 75mph on the highway. And I have a fairly loud exhaust system, so this is impressive.

A HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER.



3742	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works great so far after 1 week.  Came with instructions how to hard wire.  Btw: white stripe is power lead.


Solid construction; not cheaply made
6496	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	We were told that signal boosters would help connect the cell tower's reception and bring it right to your living space.  We have majorly horrible reception where we live. At most times, we would only have 1 bar and there were many times where it would even show "No Service".  In fact, the booster did a quick analysis and showed that we live in a dead zone, which why we have bad reception!

Not enough juice to charge power hungry tablets to full
Another personal gripe can be the size.  For what it can do, this is very compact, but I look at my wife's slim phone and often get jealous.  Of course, hers doesn't do have the things mine can do.  But keep that in mind... be prepared to be carrying around a small brick if you pick up this phone.
6707	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Does it work?  Yes. Does it work as advertised - yes.  I can count on one bar in the house without the Wilson, using the Wilson, as advertised, I get 5 bars.  The key is AS advertised........ this is not going to be used any other way. The location of the recieving antenna and the transmitting antenna is CRITICAL!  You need to be fairly close to the recieving end of this  and everything pretty  much needs to flow in one direction.

The 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life.  The quality of the audio I hear is very good, and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good.  However, the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers, which wasn't the case with my prior 510.  I assume this was just a defective unit.
I recently took a trip where I had a almost 3 hour plane ride. I was watching movies the entire flight and before while waiting to board. I had the screen on full. I didn't have to worry about my battery at all. It lasted all day and I still had plenty of juice when I was ready to settle in the hotel room.
- No modern bells or whistles
1831	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the best cellphone I have owned to date and I've owned a lot of them. The RAZR does everything I want it to do yet the form factor is so thin and it looks so beautiful that I can hardly imagine it actually being any better.
The phone paired with no issues to my E815.  I also tried pairing to an iPhone 3g and it worked just fine.  Connection speed was very fast.  To power the unit on and off all you do it extend the boom, extremely simple operation.  I didn't have to mess with any tiny buttons.  When someone calls me all I do it extend the boom and start talking.

Lastly, though I do find this increadibly handy, I don't know that it's worth the asking price that's usually listed.  If a cell phone of any kind is connected to a service, the most it should cost the customer is $200 with a service contract.  There's really no excuse for charging people $500 for any phone (and I wouldn't have bought mine if it didn't cost me exactly $75 used).  They're selling you a service and making you sign a contract that they'll charge you big time for breaking, so they should take the additional expense when it comes to equiptment for for accessing services they're going to charge you or your company through the nose for anyway.
Cool Features: Bluetooth, MMC Card [16MB included- but upgradable], large screen, plays any MIDI you can drop into it, IR connectivity.
5110	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've walked about 300 feet from my phone with this and gotten reception. This was out in the open in sight of the phone though. Different story when you're in buildings. Not bad for loudness, but people can't hear above wind noise if you're in a wind. Great battery life on standby. I don't use my phone that much so I don't know how well the battery lasts for conversations.
If the phone has any problems, the motorola agents are unavailable to help in any way except to offer to maybe repair it if sent in, for more than the cost of an unlocked version.
I got this so I wouldn't have to carry a cell phone and my Palm Pilot.  Entering and viewing appointments is just average, my Palm was much better.

8750	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This phone is great at doing what phones should do best -- calling and receiving calls.  I purchased a Motorola F3 for a great price just before a trip to Nicaragua in 2009.  I purchased a SIM card at the airport in Managua, loaded minutes onto the phone, and didn't have any problems.  It was much cheaper than adding international service through my carrier in the US.  The battery life on this phone is excellent.  I'm thinking about upgrading phones to one that has better texting capabilities and one that isn't quite so old.  Overall, this is a great, inexpensive phone.  It worked great for me in high humidity and it's very slim, so it's great if you plan to keep it in your pocket while you travel.
it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed.

Bottom line, order these!!  You won't regret it.
I had SE K850i prior to N82. Camera experience: SE loses big time. I finally have no need for my point and shoot camera and am currently selling it. N82: Great photos, nice design, very nice audio quality: both from external speakers and using headphones. Wi-fi works flawlessly. So far it's working perfectly. No restarts or glitches whatsoever. Great phone! Thank you Amazon!
6237	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I recently purchased this device to replace my Stitchway iPhone charger and can say that it has been one of the better addons to my phones i have purchased. It has been able to charge my phone from 50% to full in a short amount of time without a dent in the amount of charge the unit holds. I am waiting for my next trip overseas to fully test out the capabilities of this product. I did the recharge of my iphone with no load on the device and it sitting on my desk so my next test will be to run it while videos are playing to see how good it keeps the current charge. The unit is very small and comes with a pouch which can fit the accessories making it great for a trip.

Cons:
The cable does charge the phone, and syncing works just fine. The cable is well made with strain reliefs on both connectors. The sync button has a nice click to it and the five contacts are gold plated.
There are other phones with more vivid colors or larger screens, etc., but you get so much more phone than any other is capable of today (in the US).  You can't go wrong--and it's free!  How can you beat it?  You can't.
2921	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love the mirror screen protector it gets lots of second looks. I am always asked about it and even where did I get it from. It comes in very handy to fix your lipstick or hair, just not while driving.
290	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I can go two days and more with this battery.  The black cover looks great with its design and fits perfect.  I am rewarded with a two year guarantee which I think is one of the best warrantee in the industry.  The price was a great value, and was considered very reasonable.
Realistically 4.5 stars
1283	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this headset last year and have not been entirely satisfied. It does work fairly well, but I would echo some of the complaints from other reviewers; that it doesn't fit real well on the ear (glasses or not), and the volume doesn't go up enough.
2923	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Mirror works very well but becomes troublesome when under direct light as it reflects towards you.

I've gone through three of these units from three different sources, and they all have the same problems.  So it is not an issue of just getting a bad item at one time.
503	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This stylish -- uniquely so -- cell phone from Nokia is large but surprisingly light, and the color screen is one of the best I've seen on a cell phone.  The circular dialing pad does take some time to get used to, but likely not as hard as you'd think.  The ring tones are nice and loud enough for everybody, and the built-in camera is easy to use.  But T-Mobile ranks as the worst mobile operator in the country.  The German-owned company has sporadic cellular coverage outside the New York metro area, tends to overbill its customers, and has a user-unfriendly website.  While I wholeheartedly recommend the 3650, I advise you stay away from T-Mobile.  Get AT&T Wireless instead.
4039	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this cable from SF Planet to fit a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Palm-Centro/dp/B002JTIUZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Palm Centro</a>&nbsp;smartphone for charging and synchronizing on 32 bit Windows XP. This cable should also work with a Mac. You can charge but not sync with a 64 bit version of Windows.
7931	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Didn't work for connecting a card reader to a smart phone. It was useless, but the price was so low at $1.76, so it was not worth the try to the post office.
Holds an amazing charge!
Great unit, good features and a good price!


The form factor is nice to the touch. I have not dropped the phone yet, and it has not slipped out of my hands. The buttons are easy to use and respond very well.
For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++
740	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These have got to be the best in dash cigarette sockets made. I've purchased 4 of the for different projects. If you don't like the  2 screw face plate it can be removed and use it without
I can hear clearly and be heard clearly.  It rests well on the ear and doesn't cause discomfort.  It has fallen off once as I was getting out of a car as it just slipped so I just have to be aware of that.
2626	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The headset paired easily to my cell phone (LG Venus) and performed as expected. It is fairly comfortable to wear for extended periods, the sound is clear and the controls (volume, track) are easy to operate. My only concern is whether the flashing blue light will be too annoying to others in a dark airplane cabin (e.g. at night). It is perfect to use around the house.
3116	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice product.  I have a nokia surge and film that is made for it cost so much that I had to look elsewhere. My girlfriend has a pantech crossover and needed a protective film too. So this is where I went.  They fit almost everything and do it very nicely.  They only drawback is it takes a bit of time to trim them to fit.  Great product!!

524	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Nice!

8190	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased very expensive heads set and have been quite dissapointed with those purchases. My brother bought this product a while ago and recommended it to me to try it. I have now used it with my iPhone and it works pretty good. The reception has been far better than my other Jawbone and Motorola H700 series. I love that it also cost me a lot less. It feels very comfortable on the ear, I usually forget I have it on after a while. Nice volume too. The controls volume are a bit akward for me to up and down the volume, but I use my iPhone for that instead. Overall, I am pretty pleased with this purchase. My next bluetooth, will be another from Jabra.
Cons:
8270	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I ordered an Otterbox Defender series case from amazon.com through the marketplace. It actually came from pushcartdeals. The shipping and price were very much a great deal. But, the case when I recieved it was missing the screen protector and keyboard membrane. I sent pushcartdeals an email and recieved nothing in return yet. Everything else was just fine except not recieving what I paid for in full. The case itself is great, at least the pieces I have protect the phone very well.

2. The charger lights do not go out when the device is charged.  I can see how you might overcharge some devices because there is no automatic circuit that detects when the battery is fully charged.  Such "battery full" circuits are almost always present in chargers made for specific devices.
-the keypad and phone itself (except for the screen) doesn't attract fingerprints as much as the N75
Pros:
things on or off. The iTorch also comes with two charging cables, a USB
Stylish outfit, with a LED light built-in, which can function as a flashlight. Can charge iPad& Galaxy Tab, they need a higher current which other brands doesn't have.

5653	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got a newer version of this tip which is better than the picture. Looks and fit better than the original I had from the shack.
- Bluetooth (works with headphones and car, not with PDA)
5496	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	AMAZING JUST AMAZING I CANT WAIT TO USE IT!!!
3) it can charge from many sources. I use the adapter for my motorola phone and share the chatger. A big plus for me.
was able to fully recharge my Android (less than 10% battery) and
The other battery I bought about a year ago and they don't seem to be in business any longer.

Almost everything
Range was fantastic also (100ft).
5022	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have a charger case that was not compatible with the ear buds that came with my iPhone. Point blank, they wouldn't fit. This product solved my problem and worked well without any problems or shorts. I do recommend the purchase of this adapter for it's price.

8709	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Fits and works perfectly.
Called Wilson "Tech Support."  The gentleman suggested that I return this product and get a 'more powerful / better unit.'
4114	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The Samsung WEP210 may be the worst bluetooth I've tried.  You can barely hear the caller.  It doesn't want to stay in the ear at all.  Most importantly, the call quality was terrible.
Summary


First off, the design of it looks a bit off-putting.  It uses military-grade noise reduction technology and the look of the headset makes me believe that this particular headset may have been originally intended for such use.  It's not exactly the most attractive headset out there - definitely not the most feminine.
7820	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	No complaints.  Works!
84	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3.
4658	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good case.

You set up the indoor part where ever you want to have your cell phones signal amplified at. An office or living room makes a good location since you want to use a place where your okay with anyone going there to make cell phone calls, and also you want to use a room with a coax cable. If you set it up in a bedroom, you'll find everyone (including guests) will have to go in there just to use the phone.

5487	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great Product! Just as I expected!

- Both phones have ringtones are loud enough to be heard
Music stops when I get a text, but won't start again until I get my phone out and look at the message (or tell my phone I don't want to look at it now) -- I find this to be the biggest bummer, but I don't know if it's just my model of phone.
2.  Weight: It is certainly one of the heavier phones in the market. So if you are moving from a lighter instrument you might want to consider this issue.
3981	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	SO far I really like the bluetooth device. It easily connects to my phone every time I turn it on. The only thing I don't like about it is the lil mic that pops out but that does serve a purpose in case you decide to use your sun visor. The speakers on the device are crazy loud and you won't have any trouble hearing the person on the line. I gave it a 4 cause I would like the device to be smaller but it works great like its supposed to.
3799	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Got the product, plugged it into my car, everything worked.  Good news so far.  The second time I used it, the USB ports didn't work.  Maybe I blew a fuse on it, except the 12 V sockets were working.  Just a defect in the USB ports.  I got a refund, so the seller was great about it.  And I know manufacturing is never 100% perfect, but I wasn't willing to try again.  Bought something else.


I would have returned this immediately, except that only "non-opened" items can be returned.
8347	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It's made of elastic. I was expecting something a little more durable.
6586	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This does boost the signal. I went from zero bars to 5. The only downside is that I have to be within about 2 feet of the indoor antenna for it to work.
lacking small size silicone earflans
2236	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This device is a small attachment for any of the Navigon 2100, 5100 or 7100 series GPS.

I would also like to see a built in outlet charger, although I love the smaller size of the product.
3: wait about 20 seconds.
1803	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I needed to replace my old surround sound stereo because it lacked HDMI inputs so I put it to use as my audio stereo only problem was no input for a turntable which is why I bought this phono pre-amp. It was very easy to hook up and have noticed no difference in sound than with my old receiver which had a dedicated phono input. Its small enough to sit on top of my receiver while in the cabinet so its out of sight. Its getting harder to find stereos with phono inputs and for those of you that already have a surround system without a phono input this is a good solution. You can spend alot more on one of these and maybe the audiophiles of the world can hear the difference but for the casual listener this should work fine.
3098	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Awesome product. Fast shipping. Item as advertised. Thank you
7422	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is my 2nd Blue Parrot i still have the first one and its still going strong this one is better it has longer talk time 10 hrs. This is really a noise canceling headset. the microphone is right by your mouth not by your ear where it can p/u other noises. Those of you who ever owned a noise canceling mic for you cb know you have to have the mic close to your mouth for others to hear you while it won,t p/u other noises. This company also stands by there products should you have any problems.comparing this to like a jawbone there is no comparison i have friends who have them both and you can hear the difference. Many other friends all share this opinion even those who don,t own one can hear the difference. The volume for what i hear is loud and crisp that i have to actually turn the volume to medium .The only other headset that can compare somewhat is the one by motor trend.

The pluses: Good reception for the most part; great speaker phone (better than my wired office phones); good display.
1459	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am replacing my old Plantronics Voyager 510 with a new Voyager 510.  I plain wore out the last device.  I work in an outdoor service environment, requiring I wear hearing protection.  This requires me to frequently remove it from service and put it in a pocket or the console of my vehicle.  It took quite a beating over the 2+ years I had it.  I bought my wife one for Christmas when a hands-free device in cars became law in this state.  It does a good job in volume adjustment and has very good clarity.  The earpiece inserts gently into the ear, making it easier to hear the person on the other end than other units that "hang" over the ear.  It also keeps the unit comfortably in place.  I appreciate the noise-canceling feature as well, which is a big plus in noisy environments.  I also like the rechargeable litheon-ion battery technology: I can use this unit for days between charges.  Unless they can improve on this headset, I hope it remains in production for a long time to come.

I'm turning off my phone today...
But would I buy it again? Yes. There aren't many neat phones like this and if there's another one with quad band GSM too I didn't find it.
Now, there is a way to get around menu access problems without doing a reset of the phone. Go to the offline mode, and try accessing the menus.. It works!! Now when you come back to the normal(online) mode, they are still available... as long as you don't restart the phone! Also, the menus will work only once you actually access those menus from the offline mode, and later come back to online.

2723	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have dropped my phone on concrete from above my waist. The phone bounced and landed fine. It is "grippy," fits the phone perfectly, NFC works while case is on, doesn't dramatically change the phone's size.

The biggest problem with this headset is the volume. I cannot hear the person talking with the volume up on the phone, and on the headset, when I am in my car on the interstate, with the windows up and the air conditioning on. If I turn off the air, I can press the headset against my ear and then I can hear. I have normal hearing and a quiet (fairly new) automobile.

The battery lasts about 3 hours after fully charged... good enough for me.
The battery life for playing music is poor: perhaps 3 hours, about the same as talking on the phone. If you play a lot of music on a flight, you won't be able to use the phone when you land.
Will order another one for the second bathroom.
6573	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I originally installed a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wilson-Electronics-Mobile-4G-Vehicle-Cellular-Signal-Booster-Kit-Retail-Packaging-Blue/dp/B00JG9O2P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wilson Electronics Mobile 4G Vehicle Cellular Signal Booster Kit - Retail Packaging - Blue</a>&nbsp;in my truck and rated it 4 stars (maybe 5). It does what it is advertised to do, but my experience with it only produced marginal improvements. So why the 4+ star review? Well, if you're in an area where you have only 1 bar and you get an additional bar, that could mean the difference between a call staying connected and a dropped call. Also, the booster (I'm no electrical engineer) seems to smooth out the signal (so whatever bars you have are also more consistent (? Again, I'm no engineer). Other reviewers noted an increase in data speed, but that's something I have yet to notice.
CONS:
Buy one now, you know you need it.  Save yourself from that feeling of haplessness that comes with forgetting to plug your battery operated electronics in.
The sound is great but like others on here the fit leaves something to be desired.  This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with.  Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop.  I realize that all ears are different but I've had cheap headsets that fit great because the engineers did not try to over-engineer the fit process.
I have chargers for my iPhone when I'm at home and in my vehicle - I'm hoping that I can put this in my purse and for those times when my iPhone is dead or almost dead, I can plug the IMP52D in and use my iPhone until I get a chance to charge it -
Overall, the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly, it will crack. However, we all want a lightweight headset...so maybe I shouldn't complain. The Scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the # on your cell phone. However, you have to press the button on the Scala after picking up incoming calls. This results in a 2-3 second delay...an eternity if you've got another person on the line saying "hello? hello?".

6597	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this because cell phone signal was bad.  This works great for one room.  I upgraded to larger one.  But if you have small house or just service bad in part of house this should work for you.  Trust me it works.

I ordered some other items from other vendors on Amazon.com. I received this product first actually two days ago. I am still waiting to receive anything from the other vendors. This does not mean their service were exceptionally slow. The service @ MyGearStore.com is just exceptionally fast. The lowest price I was able to find plus the fastest service. I am a customer of MyGearStore.com who will DEFINITELY be looking to do more business with them in the future. Thank you for your valued service.
I ordered mine with not just a custom wiring harness for my 1998 Accord EX, but with a custom wiring harness which includes prewired mute configuration (quickconnectproducts dot com).  I was dreading having to run the wiring for power until I realized I didn't have too!!  The power is also automatically taken via the wiring harness from the power going to the radio.  I installed it myself in about 1 hour.

9991	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I am very happy with this battery for the Razor phone. Definitely a must if your battery cycle life is down.
And, here's what I did to "repair" them:
I have tried so many bluetooth head sets, spent hundredths and hundredths and hundreths of dollars (plantronics discovery 645, the jawbone, motorola and on and on) but the scala units are by far the best.
3961	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Overall, I really like this bluetooth speakerphone. But, I have had problems with the slide-out microphone not going back in after use. I actually had to open it up and glue the holding latch back in place twice now. A pain? Yes. But not too much to stop using it - the sound quality is the best I've used so far.
I've been using the Trent external charger for over a year now, especially on international flights.  Absolutely wonderful!
Cons:
- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.
A neat function that the nuvi200 has, is the capability to add additional POIs from external sources for free.  All you need is an Internet connection, a USB cable and a computer.  By searching the Internet for nuvi200 POIs, you will be able to find some neat stuff like free POIs for restaurants, state parks, red light camera locations, etc.  You will also find that Garmin and other companies out there offer additional POIs that you may purchase and load into your device.  I was able to acquire (for free) a POI for red light cameras for the entire US.  This feature comes in pretty handy, especially since I live around the DC area where there are cameras almost literally at every corner.  Once you load the red light camera POIs into your nuvi200, the system will give you a warning beep and display a message which informs the driver that there is red light camera up ahead.
I would rate at at 4 stars FOR THIS PRICE POINT.  At the price, my only real complaints are that I would like more characters on the screen and would like better support for handsfree.

Now the true test, and see if this little booster could deliver signal in the RV.  I plugged it in, wired the antenna to a high spot on the roof.  Low and behold, I had 1 Bar of signal.  Tried to make a call, no dice.  I tried moving the antenna and was able to find a better spot on the roof that gave my phone a much better signal 2-3 bars 4G at -98dB.  Now that is pretty good! Then power-cycled cell off/on (Airplane mode on/off)  I saw LTE pop up at -107dB.  Took my phone out of the weBoost cradle and immediately dropped to 1 bar -119dB, then NO SERVICE.  Back in cradle, and like magic, got a signal.  I tried calls, data, etc.  everything worked flawless.  This booster worked beyond what I expected or hoped for.  For the first time in years, I can relax on a remote camping vacation knowing I can take care of work related issues if they arise.  I then tried tethering other devices to smartphone and we all had respectable data coverage, enough to actually stream video at night.

7347	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great phone. You can use it in other countries as long as you get a sim card in the country that you're in. I had this phone for 5 years before it stop working. My husband used this phone when he was overseas in Iraq for 2 years. He never lost a signal.

2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products.  I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls.  Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints.  Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but few past 10 feet without the call degrading or dropping.

Next up was Metro, it too didn't offer a solution.  I was bummed and had finally given up when I was driving and saw a random hole-in-the-wall cell phone place. I figured one more [final] try can't hurt.  Walked in and immediately, him:  "oh you have a Firefly, I haven't seen those in years."  It felt like I heard angels singing and bright lights shining down on this young man.  Me: "I love you!"  lol
2895	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	First of all, let me state that I have a degree in electronics engineering and many years of experience as a communications engineer; so I do not come at this thing as an amateur.
The aliph seems to have a limited range of about three feet when paired with the Samsung and starts to have static when moved farther away. It is probably much better to have the handset far from the head while also having a weaker RF energy from a less powerful bluetooth device next to the brain. An apologist would call this a "safety feature". (deduct one star for limited range)

IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.

With the flow restrictor out and my other shower head going, I can run it out, so either I need to run one or the other, shorten my showers, or put the restrictor in and see how well it works with 2.5 gallons a minute.  It isn't as classy looking as many of the shower heads I've looked at or owned, but damn.... it feels good.  Excellent coverage and just drenches you like a warm monsoon storm.

If you wanted to do all three at once, I'm not sure even the expensive gear could solve that problem...



Get one, you'll be glad that you do.
*UPDATE* It's been about 3 weeks now since I first tried this headset out and I take back what I said about it. I have used it almost on a daily basis (when I'm indoors) and I would occasionally ask the people I'm talking w/ on the phone "How do I sound on the headset?" and they were quite surprised to hear me ask that because they told me it didn't even sound like I was using one. So after my little "INDOOR field test" I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to dive into the bluetooth technology pool. Please note that I have only used it indoors...
2375	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Never have a problem with dropped calls.  The ear hook took me months actually to figure out but I face the loop up with respect to the unit if I hold it horizontally (90 degrees to the unit) and it stays in perfectly and comfortably.  My only issue is that if there is too much noise around me I cannot hear the call, but except for a piece that plugs into the ear any bluetooth will have this problem.
OVERALL RATING 2 stars (average of my phone and mp3 ratings)

Just a stupid phone
The qwerty keyboard is as nifty as it is handy to use and the screen has nice colorization.  The battery life is really good. I absolutely love the backlighting and 1-touch and voice activated dialing features.  The internet works fine - though I'm too cheap to use it often (LOL).  I do have to confess I've downloaded a ringtone or two (OK, three) as me and my kids really love that feature.  The camera works OK - pictures could be clearer, but then again, I use my digital camera - rarely my phone - to take pictures.

I love this case.
8612	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Cellet is the best quality cell phone products. Whenever I need something I check first to see if they make it.
First I tried -- and wasted thirty bucks on -- a pair of no-name cheapo Chinese buds sold by an Amazon third-party vendor.  BIG mistake -- the buds wouldn't pair with the Ariaz, and the vendor ducked my questions about his return policy.  Grrr...
7962	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I rarely got the product to work - it would connect and then disconnect. When it did work, the audio quality was terrible and the volume too low. The menus were too confusing - couldn't figure them out (and I'm an engineer). I tested it with my Verizon XV 6800 Pocket PC phone - and later found from a friend that this company's products have problems with HTC produced Pocket PC's (which manufactured the phone), and this is according to their own technical support people.
7469	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this cable is the easiest way to transfer music, photos, and videos from your computer to phone, and vice versa. cheap and fast shipping. excellent product.
The iPhone fits perfectly into the holder and the aux cable is nice and thin. I actually used the phone in this setup when I wanted to have a conference call and the other person's voice coming out of the car stereo worked great for that purpose.
The keyboard is goofy, but gets a lot of looks.  The only caveat is to be sure your employer allows camera phones before buying.
The Jawbone noise reduction works in many situations that all others do not.

1260	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this for some members of my family. All of them love theie headsets. When I speak with them while they are using it, there is little to no background noise. the headset isn't to bulky as others are and youget about 6 hours of talk time. It has been connected to Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung cell phones.
5673	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This headset was very statiky and did not work well.  I ended up returning it.  I purchased a few on-line which did not work at all.  I would stronly reccomend buying a product like this from a brick-and-morter store.  It might save you a lot of hassle.

I orginally bought two of these at a mall kiosk before I found this on Amazon. Paid $30 for two and when my wife misplaced hers, I found this gem of a price on Amazon.
5. Very good audio reports from those I am talking to. No one has yet detected that I was even using a headset.
1. If you can, it is better to try on or look at a headset in real life before buying it on Amazon. All of these headsets fit differently. Or else you return it if it does not work well for you. (I did not buy this from Amazon for myself due to fit but I bought it as a present for my brother from Amazon).
Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.
My iPhone 3Gs needed a new battery.  I researched all the options and videos about how to replace it and decided that this product would satisfy my needs for now.  My internal battery lasts about 4 hours and then I have to plug this in to recharge it.  My battery has such little reserve that this product charges it in less than an hour.  Typically, I don't even have to use the phone during this time, but if I do, the cord is no problem to have connected.  I can charge my phone at least 3 times before I have to recharge this product.




I got the good stuff from Amazon.com !!

However it does not like hubs, at least the unpowered one I plugged it into, thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars.
4149	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	After trying several other bluetooth headsets from the likes of Plantronics and Motorola, I tried the Aliph Jawbone.  After having two of these fail after less than 6 months each, I have given up on the Jawbone.

That rattle at higher volumes?  Kind of annoying.



8869	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I like the size of this battery.  It is easily pocket-able and feels sturdy enough to withstand the occasional drop.  The flashlight is a nice touch but it would be nice to see a dedicated switch for the flashlight.  The surface of the battery is very close to a matte black finish that helps with not showing fingerprints.  The battery seems to charge my iPhone without any issues.  It's nice that New Trent has included a charging cable with the device so you can just use your iPhone wall charger or PC for charging.

2920	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This screen protector looks awesome, don't get me wrong - but it's completely impractical. It's really hard to see through in normal light and almost impossible to see through in sunlight/outdoors/bright lighting. Too bad.. it looked super awesome on the iphone :(

9394	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	At first we weren't sure if this was going to work. We put both the Booster and the outside antenna in our windowsill (inside), connected the cable to the inside booster, and tried to figure out if we were going to get better cell service by watching the little antennas on our phones. But that proved impossible. The real test came this morning when I went into the kitchen and made a call, and it was strong and dependable. I then walked throughout the house on that call, and it stayed strong. So I can honestly say this thing works. It is also extremely easy to set up. The only tiny negative is that you have to have a place for the inside booster, and you have to hide the wires. But if you need stronger cell service, this works.
7244	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I am 72 and wanted JUST a good phone but felt I was not ready for a "senior" phone and definitely did not want a smart phone.

It is a super phone...great reception, well made, takes photos (not great but good enough for wallpaper), and does not have all the junk that I did NOT want. I am thrilled with it...if what you want is just a great phone then go for it! It also has darn good battery life. Before I put my sim card in it I had transferred all my contacts to the sim card and presto when the sim card went in all my contacts where there. By the way the phone sent to me was definitely new and not refurbished. Thanks Amazon and Motorola .

5288	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	this did not have enough tension on the hook when I first tried it.  bending it down fixed it- it is a very cheap and flexible plastic but works when you bend the hook down, needs occasional assistance but at that price I'd buy a few, expecting to get a few months out of each one.  works better than the unit that clips the middle of the top- most i580's break there
reads the manual, no one would know how to do it.
Also, I found the description of a couple of Virgin Mobile's monthly plans a little confusing - especially the whole "cash balance" part.  However, when I called customer support they were very helpful and informative.


Pairing with my Razr was very easy.  I tried with a V600 as well and again no problems.  Call quality is good and I can walk into the next room and still have no problems with the call.  Haven't tested the max effective range, but I can walk around the aparment and it does seem to meet specifications.  My Razr is impossible to hear in a noisy environment but if I use this headset I haven't had any problems.  Seems to be ok on the other end as well.
  highly reccomend this

The customer support said that this is a known issue and that they are working on it to provide a firmware update which would be sent to the phones. They said they do not know the release date as to when it will be available, and we could know more in the coming weeks. It might go more than one month, as it is still in the developmental stage.
3944	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this headset to use with my Motorola Q to replace another headset that simply was a piece of junk. The BT5010, which has Version 2.0 Bluetooth, initially was uncomfortable but after I finally figured out how to make the adjustments it is comfortable enought for me to keep on all day. It paired up very easily with my Q without error. I have had it now for a month and overall I am still very happy with the headset. The sound is clear and the sliding boom is a feature that I very much like, it makes it very easy to make and answer calls. You can also wear the headeset on either ear. I must admit that the vibrate in the ear for incoming calls was something that I had to get used to, but I can assure you that you will never miss a call. I would highly recommend this headset to anyone, overall this headset was a great choice and one that I would make again.

5672	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have had a number of other Motorola headsets that I liked, but the batteries quit charging making the headset useless. So, a month before I bought this one, I bought a higher-priced Plantronics bluetooth headset. The Plantronics did not work 5 feet from my iphone and had very poor sound quality. So, after reading more reviews, I decided to try this Motorola. I am most pleased with the amazon.com price, with the distance this headset works from my phone, with the length of use time between charges, and with the size and design that are attractive and discreet. I can see how people with smaller ear openings may have a problem with the ear bud fitting well. It fits into my ear opening and is comfortable to wear for hours. Last night, I did not notice that I still had it on three hours after returning from work. Now, we'll see how long it lasts before the batteries no longer charge. I am so pleased that I am planning to by another to use while this one charges. I have owned at least ten other Motorola headsets. This is the first for which I would like another of the same model.

The window mount is not at all intuitive but works well once you figure it out.  You have to loosen it all the way then attach the suction cup then tighten it.  It's all very strange but it does work.
UPDATE - Jan 08, 2007: the Treo750 (windows mobile) has come out in the UK with Vodafone, and here in the USA, the Treo680 (Palm OS) has been announced with Cingular.  In forums on the internet, people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the Treo faithful: slighly thinner (a modest few millimeters), internal antenna, better keyboard, volume-too-low issue "sort of" resolved, better mp3 player (pTunes instead of Real), more memory, improved phone interface, EDGE instead of GPRS to double the data speed.  Unfortunately, the camera has the same resolution (640x480) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery.  Treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life (1 day or significantly less for power users).
First, they claim that this unit will cover a home of 2500 sq ft. LIE.
Crappy Universal Adapter Cables
I would recommend comparing this to newer quad-band phones since they will probably fall within the same price range.
I used to put the set in my pocket between calls.  Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.  I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead.

5253	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a wonderful organizer for all the rechargable items in your life. I have 2 phones, bluetooth headset, my digital camera, & my handheld organizer in my organizer; always ready to go and in one spot so I don't have to remember which room they're charging in. The brown faux leather looks really nice and blends in with my furniture so it's not an eyesore.
I had a faulty one, which was quickly resolved by Amazon. Other than that, the products work perfectly.
Be ready to spend some time figuring out the best location for the unit and the antenna. A lot depends upon where the nearest tower is and what kind of obstructions are between you and it. I put mine in a couple of different windows before I hit on the one with the best reception. Then, you need to place the antenna at least 10 feet from the window where the amplifier is. That entails figuring out how to run the long antenna cable so that it isn't in the way. Right now, I have the antenna attached to the glass on some artwork but I will probably glue or tack the suction cups to the wall when I am sure I like where it's located.
Pairing is a piece of cake.  Except for needing to do the initial charge I was up and running in a flash.  Open the beam and you're connected, close the beam and it's turned off. I use this with a BlackBerry Curve.
Now it's March 5th 2011 and 3 phones later this bluetooth still works great and holds a charge for about 2 days now instead of 3 days. I can't believe the price listed @ $119!! I paid $59.00 I am pretty sure.

6354	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this product based on the raving reviews that it received on here. The product looked sturdy based on the images here as well.

I only use the product 5 days a week and there's not much to mishandling except for, strap on in the morning, strap off at evenings when I get home from work. Surely, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless I received the wrong casing as described by other reviewers. To me, disappointingly, I've got to give this my first two star rating.

I did call their customer support, twice actually. The first time I got a very friendly girl who unfortunately didn't really know what she was talking about and seemed generally unfamiliar with this particular model. She told me several incorrect things and I found myself correcting her and reading parts of the manual to her, so that was a bit useless. I sensed I'd get better results with a different person so I called back later and got a young guy who was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He's the one who suggested I try and put the antenna and booster at the same general height as each other, and he also told me that the slightest angle can make a big difference, so I stopped moving it from room to room and instead tried changing the angle ever so slightly before ruling out a location. He also helped me understand my dBm readings, I understood that lower is better, but I was confused by seeing multiple network types, 4G, 3G, 1X, etc with varying dBm readings for each, and wasn't sure which one I should be "aiming for", so to speak. He helped me a lot by saying I don't really need to worry about the 4G, if I can get the 3G in a good spot that's all I need. So that simplified my troubleshooting a lot. This may be a Verizon-specific issue by the way, I'm not sure.

I must say that it does take longer for the iPhone 4s to charge all the way to 100%, but the Trent external battery does charge while your iPhone/iPod is still turned on.
Update 6/14/07

The headset would not accept a charge after about 3 1/2 months of use (light usage at that). It also seemed to have a mind of it's own when it came to staying connected to my phone, constantly having to re-boot phone and device in order to get connection (used with a Samsung cell phone).
This is the middle level Plantronics Bluetooth headset, but that being said, sound quality is about the best I've heard, and I've had three previous headsets (including the 510). Excellent sound quality, both for the owner and his/her callers.
Let me know if you have any questions, I'm happy to help.  I know I was super skeptical about the purchase given the horrible reviews, but I also noticed they were from 2008.  The purchase was the best investment for my sanity, and it will be for yours too.  I promise!
Great charging options!  Charge from AC, USB or AAA battery right out of the box, car charger is available.
decent length; since the device is portable a long cord isn't necessary.
2867	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great, works as advertised.

3139	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	If the phone width is more than 2.5  inches, don't buy it, it won't fit even the tab is adjustable. I have a Samsung S4, do not fit in.
Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it.  They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear.

I've read that the USB connections go bad on these phones and when my Blackberry Curve 8300 stopped charging, I believed it.  But I loved it so much, I bought another.  I checked out the new Bold but was unimpressed by it's bulky size and the flat keyboard (makes it hard to type) - this phone is MUCH better!
multi-function button easily reached with your thumb or forefinger.

It is tiny and extremely convenient.
5922	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I don't know what revision/version I have bought since I bought mine in September of 2012, so probably not the latest version being sold.  The one I have has given me no problems to speak of it charged my Inspire 4g while out camping or sleeping out on a boat.  Temps ranging from 30F (super cold for Florida) to temps probably over 100 while down in the Keys.  Has sat in my truck in the summer where temps can easily hit over 120.  Nice compact size and the flashlight while not super bright is sufficient to respond to the call of nature while camping in the woods.  Downside would be it's only 1.0A output which was fine for my Inspire 4g but can't put out enough power for my Oppo Find7a and it's bigger screen so the phone discharges while in use on this battery pack, albeit at a slower rate of course. I didn't take a star off for this because the product clearly states 1A output.  Durability wise it's been dropped and tossed around and aside from some of the wording on the back coming off it's fine.
Pros:
978	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a mid-priced phone, with solid features all-around, including bluetooth, good reception, nice compact size, and good battery life.  If you buy it with those expectations, you'll be very happy with it.  Compared to the higher-end phones though, it has some drawbacks.
Save yourself a lot of money (and time) and buy the best, the first time.
Also, wish it came with USB or car charger, but the battery seems to last quite a few days before needing to be recharged.
Ear "plug" does not fit well enough, should be made of that sticky rubber stuff like jabra and plantronics.  I'm going to try one of the jabra earpieces as others have suggested.
Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.
Excellent product




The eartip that goes into the ear has a poor design in how it is attached.  You have to turn it *counter*-clockwise to mount it and that's opposite of everything I've ever seen. I damn near broke the ear tip thinking I had to turn it clockwise (like everything else in the world!).  The volume up/down buttons seemed loose and were also very awkward to adjust with the headset on your ear.

2502	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Motorola puts out some very good products, but this one (Motorola H500 Headset) was a real disappointment.  It is compact and easy to sync to a phone.  But the volume is way, way, too low to be useful in most stituations, particularly traffic.  I have adjusted it a number of times to the highest setting and it is about half the volume of other bluetooth ear pieces I have.  Good price, poor buy.

1643	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My first BT headset was a Motorola HS850.  Worked well until the recharge plug snagged on the socket and parts of the socket came out with the power plug.  So I replaced it with the Plantronics 510.  I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago.  I sometimes am in noisy environments and the "lay on the ear" type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises.  The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times.  Not so with the Plantronics, at least for me.  It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications.  The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume.  I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times.  Remember, I'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls, but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor.  The clarity of the sound is excellent.  The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.
880	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I've owned 4 pairs of LG Tones, and was hoping these would be a competitor. If sound quality doesn't matter to you, these are good headphones.
I am tempted to buy extras, in case they discontinue the model.  This is the only headset I ever want to own.

9478	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Honestly, I didn't read the product description well enough when I selected to review this booster kit. I was thinking that this is something I could walk around with to boost my signal. It is not. This kit is meant to be installed in your car. Installation requires running a wire through your car and out the door to an antenna on the roof. You then have to place your phone in the holder attached to your dashboard for the system to work.

Con's: The button feels kind of cheap. I, personally, would sacrifice the flashlight (or laser pointer) space for a better switch like a toggle or slider. The indicator lights on the top are somewhat confusing. 4 lights, 3 show capacity 4th is if unit is charging something. They're placed together as if they are charge indicators. I would separate the 4th a bit, maybe put above the 3 and center the three left to right. On a user note, I'd change the order of the flashlight and laser pointer in the turn on sequence. I'll use the flashlight more. (Not necessarily a con, just an observation)
5929	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This battery is amazing.  My daughter charges it and keeps it in her purse so if she's out and her battery on her phone is low, she can plug this in and recharge it.  Her friends will even come to her for its use so their phones don't die before they get home.  Well worth its price and it'll completelly recharge your iphone in about 20min to a half hour.

Although the Jawbones are highly marketed, there are innumerable customer complaints over the Internet about how poorly built these headsets are.  Aliph seems to turn a deaf ear and seems to feel it is their due to gimmick poorly designed, ill-built, over-priced dross.

Overall, I would recommend this product, if only for peace of mind.

This things shaft is barely thicker then the male plug end that plugs into the phones headphone socket, so easily reaches thru the obnoxiously THICK phone cases outer wall! Problem solved, and works perfectly!

I have found I can get 3 full charge cycles for the iPhone 4 before the IMP500 runs out which is quite impressive.  As I indicated above, I only just recently purchased the iPad 2 so I have not yet tested to see how many cycles I can get from the IMP500 but plan on testing it out this weekend.

4) A second cable, about 4 feet long, also plugs into the booster unit and has a USB connector on the other end.  You get a gadget with a USB port for the car lighter socket so you can use that for power, or plug it directly into the USB slot in the car if you have one.  It can also be plugged into a computer USB port or port in a household outlet although I found it runs hot if plugged in directly.  I use a USB extension and that seems to work better.  There's another USB port on the side of the booster which I assume is to plug your phone in so it can charge if the booster is using the car socket.  I haven't tried that though.

1186	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Maybe I got one that was made poorly, but it didn't fit the phone at all. The quality of the material was pretty good, though.
Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used.  I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity.  I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker.  The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset.  However, it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320.  I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so.  I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality.  Finally, the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it.  Don't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire.

The battery pack itself is built quite well and looks great.  It's solid, feels good in the hand and is straightforward to use.  Just hold the button to turn it on, plug the USB connector into the battery, plug the other end into your phone, and you're good to go.  Compared to the battery in my phone, this IMP500 gives me almost 4x the power, which translates in to hours of calls, texting, surfing the web and whatever else the phone does.  Perfect for long outings and emergency situations!

3588	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	At the time when I purchased the Nuvi200 had already returned a Mio and two Megellans looking for a decent GPS unit. The Nuvi200 is a keeper. My only problem with this and most difficult to understand is WHY WHY WHY they couldn't have taken the extra step and make a allowances for categories. I guess they think that your entire database of special stops and personal points of interest can all be shoved into one category called - Favorites. I'm amazed to find that the only one making allowances for this was one called a Mio that you couldn't hardly see or hear and was the reason for taking it back or I would still have it, even over this Nuvi200, it even had better maps. The Mio was only $179 and you would think for twice that price Garmin could have made allowance in design for extra custom categories that users could make. They have this thing where custom POI can be developed and inserted but this not what I'm talking about.
I'll not be buying from this seller again.

3263	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this because of all the positive 5 star reviews. This case is nice and slim and is cheap. The big problem is it makes using the phone so much harder. A normal press of the buttons does nothing. You have to push really hard. I guess all the 5 star reviews have never used the phone with a case with cut outs.
**UPDATE November 30th, 2007**
2. I've had no problems with the antenna. However, I can see that it may be susceptible to breaking if you're not somewhat careful when turning the unit on/off. I suggest using two hands when your turning it on/off. Slowly push the antenna in all the way until you hear a click sound and then you're done.

=============================================================
[Final?] Update - Sep 2010: They keep breaking in new places. After the sixth break in the headband today, I've given up trying to repair it. So, I found a pair of headphones that I no longer use (traditional over-the-head band), and took the earpieces off. Used Gorilla Glue to blue the Samsung earpieces on. Now, the fit and comfort issues are gone - and they won't break again either. But, the cable between the 2 earpieces isn't long enough - so, right now I put that behind my head... I am thinking of cutting the wire in 2, and splicing/sodering a piece of cable in so they can go around the band over-the-head - altho will require some skill as the wires inside the cable are very very thin.
Cons: Card slots initially very tight. (a little elbow grease & patience is needed)
While I found it to fit easily onto my ear and hold well, my boyfriend who has his ears more flat against his head had a hard time hooking it on his ear and having it stay there without much adjustment needed.  Also, he said that it was too bulky for his liking, but I like it just fine!

When I'm listening to music I have stored on my X60 it plays the music well and the controls all work with Windows Media Player. If I get a call, the music will pause and I can take the call on my Treo. When I end the call, the music resumes. The sound quality is decent. It's not audiophile quality, but if you want that from a $70 wireless headset, your head is screwed on wrong. It's certainly good enough for what I want it for which is casual listening while I'm working.
Here it is:  First create your music clip from a song you like.  To do this you will need software (ie. Roxio) that allows you to edit sounds.  There is a limit on the size of the file you can use.  From what I have figured out it is about 10 seconds at low MP3 quality.  Once you are done, save the clip to your Mini SD card.  Put the card in the phone, open your sounds and send the file to your cell phone.  Once you receive the file, you will have the ability to save it as a ringtone.  Someone may have an easier what to do this but this is the only way I have found that actually works.

It's thicker that some of the thin, flimsy protectors I've seen.  That's why there's only three in the package.  Be careful applying (clean the screen before hand as recommended) to avoid dust or dirt under the screen.

There are a couple things that annoy me about this phone and keep it from a full 5 star rating.  First, the stupid Palm connector at the bottom.  I've always hated the Palm connectors.  Why the company can't switch to mini-USB like the rest of the world is a mystery to me.  The jack isn't the easiest to pull out, it's big, and I have to buy all new car chargers for it.  Also, there's no cradle.  My previous Palm devices have a cradle and I miss it, although this is cheaply remedied with some poking around the internet.  The stylus is also very thin, lightweight, and cheap.  As a result it's doesn't provide enough tactile feel and weight to effectively use the touchscreen.  I had to purchase a replacement metal stylus to bring the touchscreen use up to par.  Again, a cheap fix, just a little annoying.  Even with these shortcomings I would still be inclined to give the Centro 5-stars except for:

It fits nicely in the palm, has a single button on the front, and a bulb on either side of the input and output ports on top.

It has great battery life, along with a feature that will automatically power the unit down if it loses pairing with your cell phone for more than 15 minutes. This is a great feature, since it means you can turn it on once, run many short errands, and never have to switch the unit on and off.  It also means that you can't deplete the battery by forgetting to turn it off when you leave your car.
8974	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is a lightweight, small-sized power source that carries a big charge. Perfect for commuters, students - anyone not consistently tethered. The iTorch has power to spare. Especially useful for users of power-hogs like video and/or game apps, the iTorch provides multiple full charges for mobile devices. This is a product that does what the manufacturer specs say it will - and then some. Here's my benchmark test: from a full charge, I let my iTorch sit unused (unplugged) for 3 weeks. I then used it to charge my iPhone 4S, iPad 2 3G, iPod Touch 4G, Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, and New Trent IMP38B Bluetooth keyboard/case...and the iTorch still isn't drained.

I bought the cell phone thru Amazon and not from any of the other parties that offer the same phone.
- Can recharge using a PC, so no need for the AC adapter when traveling with your laptop
If you have a Samsung phone, this headset probably provides the best performance possible in this price range.

Tips:
Pairing it with my cell phone and my laptop wasn't too much of a hassle. I, as well as any future buyers, may be glad to know that this device supports the A2DP protocol (audio transfer), which means that you can listen to music on your laptop with your headset (although it is less than desirable quality), and if you get a call on your cell phone, you can hit the call button once to disconnect yourself from your laptop to connect to your cell phone, then hit the call button again to answer your phone. All without touching either device. =p One minor gripe, however, is that it's not very convenient to switch back to being paired with my laptop, since I have to pair the headset with my laptop again. Maybe there's a way for my laptop to "call" the headset so that I can switch connections the same way I did it for a phone call, but I'm not sure as to how to do that.
the cut.

The camera is only marginally useful.  The 15-second video is even more useless.  The quality is poor, expecially in low light.
  4.  USB plug enables charging of any device
For some reason, the buttons won't work when I set my phone to locked keys. -- as if the Jabra keys get locked too. So I can't use the key lock on the phone, which is a bit of a bummer, but I'm just mindful of which pocket the phone goes in.
The major shortcoming is that you have to completely turn off the current device (or its bluetooth radio) before you can switch to another device.  This makes no sense at all, since the Z9 has a button control for disconnecting from current device.

Attention designers... enough with the flashy blue lights.  If you are going to use blue LED's please tone down the intensity or give me the option to disable them.  Only con I have is that the buttons are very stiff to press but that helps prevent inadvertent presses.  Hopefully the buttons will "break in" over time.

The good news is that you can hook it up to an unused coax cable (if you have multiple lines).  The unit ships with 50 feet, but no need if you also have a room with coax and you know where the line comes out of your house.



4290	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have tried over-the-ear blue-tooth devices, my phone's speakerphone, and wired speakerphone devices to make hands-free calls in my car.  There was always too much background noise or my voice sounded too muffled or tinny to be heard.  I researched several blue-tooth speakerphone devices on-line, this one always seemed to come out on top.  I have not been disappointed.  I have used this in my vehicle for a over a year without complaints from callers that they could not hear or understand me.  The one-touch answering and calling makes it simple to use while driving.
6458	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a great phone but there are certain qualities to it that may make it a hassle.


The alarm clock and address book applications are fine. The included PC software works, albeit with a non-intuitive interface and text and help file written by someone who does not know English very well. The Multimedia Manager takes much too long (average 2 minutes each) to transfer mp3 files to or from the phone.
I would of gave it 5 stars but I want to use the holster function.

Of all the various options I found to add power ports to the tree stands that I looked at this was by far the easiest I could find.  I was easily able to splice two of these into the 12v power line I have coming off the battery and then use a couple of pipe straps to hold them in place.  It may not be the prettiest piece of wiring ever, but hey I have power in my tree stand now.
3390	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I purchased one of these component cables to improve the quality of my Wii on my Hi-Def Television. The cable had a defect in the "red" component (one of the three colors output), hence it had no red and looked terrible! Hard to believe that the cable passed inspection, but I assume that it sometimes happens, so I returned it and ordered a second one of the exact same type. It worked perfectly as it should. I'm satisfied now and the seller sent the replacement cable quickly.  I'd recommend one if you are looking for a slightly better picture from your Wii. It seems that a number of other customers had the same bad luck on the quality of the cable that I initially had. YMMV!
The musical part is well done (the mobile even comes with a pair of small loudspeakers which is a very nice idea in theory but nothing very practical in everyday use) and I can't help but appreciate the handy controls on the outside. This Nokia basically made my ipod a fashion accessory - why carry a mobile and an ipod if mobile offers most of ipod's functions?

Obviously you will want to purchase some higher grade velcro if you are using it in a similar application.
+ the processor is extraordinarily fast compared to anything from Motorola (including my wife's RIZR).
The sound is clear on both ends of phone calls. However, in windy condition or noisy areas, the sound quanlity suffers a lot at the other end of my connection. I think this is not suitable to use around crowded areas like the city streets or the malls etc. But it performs perfectly when used in the car while driving or in a relatively quiet setting.


The phone is blue tooth enabled and comes with a usb cord, ear plugs and an adaptor piece.  There are many other features that I don't understand, but someone who is good with technology would have no problem understanding.
I really don't want to return this (what a pain!),  but I probably will.  Just too many problems.  I don't understand why some of these problems are reported by some users and not others... maybe because it has something to do with the underlying service?  I have a Cingular Treo 650.

Finally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.

First of all, if you wear glasses, this is not the headset for you. I tried not wearing my glasses, though, and still I could not get it to comfortably stay on my head. It came with four ear buds, and only one performed moderately--again, it would not go on my head comfortably nor in my ear. I tried using it without the ear loop, but the bud was not sufficient to hold the unit on my head. I watched the advertisements for it, and saw how lovely the Noise Shield should be, but when I tested it, the performance wasn't too different from other headsets. Others told me I still sounded like I was on speaker-phone. It too was troubling having only a volume up button. Sometimes it was too loud, and I had to remove my phone from my pocket while driving to turn it down. But, didn't I buy the headset so I wouldn't have to use my phone? Very disappointed. I would recommend the headset to people with very large ears, who don't wear glasses, make no facial expressions (smiling also moved the headset off my ear), and make minimal head movements.

I bought this unit and chose to do a soft install using the window mount. With the booster in place, I can now get that same 2 bars at about -85db in my office. It only functions for about 10 ft or less from the desktop booster, and the tuning is a bit finnicky, but I am able to maintain service while near the booster. From there, I'm using my phone as a Hotspot for my laptop. I've noticed, however, that the 3G service I'm getting indoors encounters a lot more packet loss than what I get outside. So yes, the signal is just as strong, but it makes for a mediocre Internet experience. Speeds I get range from 50-300kbps with ping times between 150 to 3000.

I previously (from another source locally) purchased what appears to be this exact case, knowing it was vinyl since I looked at it in person, and purchased it since I couldn't find one that fit my phone as well as this one in leather.  It lasted about 2 or 3 weeks and the belt clip sheered right off of the case and dropped to the ground one day.
Not having to work in all the other gimmicks (camera, MP3) allows more focus to be placed on basic phone feature quality.
5911	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I had this little guy for roughly a month now and it's working great.  I'm using it to charge up my nexus 5 and it does the job.  It's small and compact so it's a perfect fit in my bag and I would carry with me all the time in case I ever run out of battery.  The best part about this is that it can charge up to 2-3 full charge.  I remember I was hanging out with my friend one day and I charged up her iPhone 4s and then my Nexus 5 the same day and both phone got full charge.
I got the Nokia 6102 about one or two weeks ago. I have to say while it is a good deal for the price I just didn't like it at all. So I returned it and got the razr. I spent a bit more on the razr, but it was reasonable. (...).

but not too heavy, and that suggests that it is a well built product. I often make presentations and use a laser pointer, so I appreciate an appropriately sized and multifunctional pointer that isn't cumbersome during presentations and takes up less room in
6110	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I never tried one of these portable batteries before, so this was a pleasant first for me. I received the iTorch right before leaving on a business trip, so the timing was perfect to get to test it on the road. While this product was packaged nicely, I will say the picture instructions/illustrations were a little confusing in that they showed an AC adapter in the picture instructions but there was a small note saying an AC adapter was not included. No matter for me, since it still came with the USB cord which I was able to plug into my own USB wall adapter. The other thing the instructions didn't indicate was how long I should charge the battery for the first time and for each time thereafter. However they did indicate what the 4 blue lights would show to indicate battery life. I plugged it in and noticed the 4 blue lights blinking in sequence, and over time they would each incrementally light up solid until all 4 were lit solid, indicating that it was fully charged. The first charge took about 3 hours to get to all 4 lights lit solid. I thought it was a nice feature to have both an LED flashlight and laser pointer built in to this device, though I didn't think I'd be getting much use out of them - however the flashlight could serve well in a pinch such as a power outage when you don't want to burn the battery of your cell phone by using its flash. While on my trip, I put this battery to the test: with one charge, it fully charged by iPhone 5, my iPad 2, my iPod, and charged my Blackberry Bold twice. Once it finally died, it only took a little over 2 hours to recharge fully again. I happened to be traveling with my boss, and while we were at the airport for our departing flight his Blackberry battery died - instead of hunting around for an unoccupied outlet I pulled out my iTorch and let him charge his Blackberry on it with his USB cord. He was pretty impressed and said he's going to order one for himself. Score.
there is a bit of a learning curve on this phone, particularly the touch pad. i had heard that the touch pad was annoying and was predisposed to dislike it. at first, it seemed like it was buggy. but then i found out that you get used to the touch pad without even realizing it. i still accidentally touch the wrong buttons now and then, but i've only had the phone for 2 weeks. every day it gets easier to use.

I was to say the least, disappointed, and ended up removing the case after a few days and re-buying my previous case.
Overall rating:
The negative: I have had two units that just quit charging. I suspect the copper charger contacts corroded. In both cases Plantronics replaced them incredibly fast and with very little hassle. If you perspire you have to clean these contacts quickly. They should change them to gold contacts.
Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.  I think you'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end.

[4 years later: This "off brand" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington "round mound" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]

4027	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this case to fit my iPhone 4 with a Otterbox Defender case. I liked that it had a loop in addition to the belt clasp. I used the loop for about 2 months before it broke loose. The phone fits nicely but the velcro flap is now not staying closed. I improvised the loop by using a key ring on the belt clasp and then a carabiner bewteen my belt loop and the key ring. Overall I'd say the quality is typical Chinese.

1663	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've used this headset for 5 months now. It comes with a variety of ear tips to help fit your ear. Spend some time with each of them to find the most comfortable. Note that with the non-round ones that you can insert them in 2 directions and no one's ears are the same. The tips can be inserted 180 degrees opposite, then you still get the extra rotating "play" they leave you to fine tune it after inserting. I ended up staying with the round one, which is comfortable and yields the flexibility of use on either ear, although I almost always wear it on the same side. I have nearly forgotten it is there and worn it for many hours straight with no discomfort. I will never go back to holding a phone to my head again. When I had a wired headset, I would only ever put it on when I was going to be in the car for a while; it stayed in the car. Now, if I'm not already wearing my headset, I will answer a ringing call with my phone only long enough to get out the headset and punch the button to bring the call to it. My wife thinks I'm weird for putting on the headset to make a call when I have to get my phone out to dial a number anyway (and actually the voice calling works really well on the Samsung!). The fact is that it is so much better sound and more convenient than holding a phone to the side of your head.
lots of features
--the calendar is very usable for tasks. In one push of a button, the entire month is displayed nicely with mark on days with impt appointments and to-do's. The week count is also indicated--useful for us in manufacturing, who counts workweeks.
Overall, it is very good but not perfect. If it weren't for the over-the-ear comfort issue, I would give it a 5.
126	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Broke within a few months of receiving it.  Not a happy camper on this purchase.  Cord is way too short.  Too much of a hassle to return it.
8115	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is not only an eye catching case but also very durable and practical. Only criticism: it is easy to get the 'watermark' or dust under the screen protector but that is a small price to pay for the protection. I also do miss access to the mute button but can work around it using settings.
My main objections are two. The voice dialing function in the LG is markedly INFERIOR to the Samsung. The old phone almost always recognized my instructions and the internal voice responses were clear and useful. The LG has difficulty recognizing my commands, even after training, and it's internal voice responses are very hard to understand. This may be minor, but after knowing how well the function COULD work, it's a disappointment.
Longevity: My warranty is now expired, and I never had to use it.  Owned for 14 months and no issues with my pair.
5258	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The price was cheap and the shipping was great, the item arrived on time. However the item did not work with my phone, the adapter was not the right fit for the phone. I might of recieved the wrong item because it wasn't the one for the phone I ordered

7887	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased this item and it would not work when the headphone was plugged in all the way...the sound was muffled.  But it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in 3/4 of the way.  Eforcity sent me a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement doesn't work at all.
Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures.

* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a "WYSIWYG" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year old&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Motorola-A1200-MING/dp/B000SZOKN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Motorola A1200 MING</a>, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).
2186	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I'm very dissapointed... install the tool but it does not recognize my K1s... reinstall, install, try to update it and the K1 is not in the list of compatible phones for this software... waste of money... it should come with the phone... at least I can use the cable to download pictures, songs and movies to the memory card. Make sure there is an update for this software about the K1 before buy it.

5134	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Received this holder quickly. It is fine quality and is just as described. Hard to believe it is so cheap. The only complaint I have is that the belt attachment seems to make the phone stick out too far on your belt. That's why I need a clip, not the fancy one this comes with. But, this only preference. It's a fine product.
1740	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	For those palm treo 650 on up users, if you need a hotsync/charger that you can take with you when you travel this is defintely the one to have.  Its a no-brainer type of accessory and it DOES do both charge and hotsync your palm treo device on your desktop or laptop computer.  I got it because I travel a lot and don't like disconnecting the cable from my desktop just to take it with me every time I head out of town.  That is the convience of having such a good accessory as this combo.  I would have given it a full 5 stars accept that it did not have a hotsync button directly on the cable itself.  You have to go directly to your device and use the hotsync application on it in order to do the hotsync; which is ok but having the button on the cable itself would have been a plus.  Other than that This product is excellent.
- the media player is choppy at times and I will have to assume that this is a bug.
I highly recommend this item.
2. This is more an issue with Notes and IntelliSync but syncing personal Notes contacts with my BBerry was a pain. Intellisync crashed when exporting my contacts initially. To get them all over to BBerry I eventually had to export them from Notes to Vcard, vcard to outlook express, and Sync Outlook Express to BBerry via Intellisync. Also, because I use multiple Notes address books (the contacts list on the client and the company address book on the server) I'll never really have a sync'd list.

624	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I need to charge my AA's for my 3 Canon Speedlite flashes before each wedding. I use Sanyo Eneloops and also some older Duracell rechargeable. I was impressed how it could take old batteries that wouldn't recharge in other chargers, and it completely restores them to working order! The 16-bay charger makes it so easy to just dump all the batteries in over night and be ready in the morning for work! I highly recommend this to every professional photographer.
Comes with a cloth pouch to store the battery pack, but there was no way to include the charging cable without scratching the battery pack's glossy interior. Which now brings me to the biggest issue with the product:
All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use.  The is sound quality not worth the pain.

Update 9/29/09:

The magnets that connect the earpieces to the headset is really good. They have not fallen once so far.

Features: SE wins hands down. Read the features at each phone's respective website; I won't waste your time here. The LG Shine is the most basic of phones. The only thing its got over the SE is 3G. The Shine is all looks.
The size of the unit, awesome. I really like how it feels, very well constructed. I also like how easy it works with all of my devices. Flexibility is a real selling point, I love being able to use it on so many devices.

4080	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The phone is scratched, they were advertising it as new but looks rather refurbished. It is okay if they advertise it as a refurb phone but they created false expectations .


4701	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought this to use with a RC Heli I got from Asia.  This adapter allows you to use pretty much any countries specific plug type.

-Awesome camera resolution. Really digital camera-like. Even the indoor night pictures w/ flash came out great! Most people think it's a camera because of the way it looks and they give you that weird look when you ask them to take a picture of you ... and you hand them a phone!

3311	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The plug won't even fit into the back of my LG TV.  The diameter of the outer ground ring is too large to fit.  I'm sure the TV plugs are standard, so this cable obviously isn't.  Very disappointed that we couldn't even try it out because it won't fit.

4202	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This headset works pretty well with good noise canceling, but it won't stay attached to my ear so the part that rests on my face loses contact.  At most it will stay on my head for 10 minutes. I find myself repeatedly twisting the thing back into place.  The second one I got (the first was missing parts) came apart when I tried to unplug it from the charging cable. Jawbone does not seem to offer any other buds (not even spares) so I just ordered some Acoustibuds in the hope that I can actually use it. If they don't work I will try a hack I saw with a Jabra eargels product - that involves cutting up the supplied earbuds and gluing the eargels to the locking piece. I will update this review once I get it to work (or not)
I'll be getting another of these cases and I know my friends who have seen it want one as well.
The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red "jewels" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.
5857	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is Motorola's phone designed for emerging markets.  A great value for the price, it's a durable, reliable phone, but it doesn't do much else.  I bought this to ride out the last two months in my AT&T contract, and it has worked fine.

1)Small and cool looking. Most people who have seen it seems to be enamored with its design and form factor. It is definitely an eye catcher.
Overall, I am very impressed with the iTorch IMP52D and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a USB Battery Pack.
8141	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Very light and kind of flimsy.  It keeps my cell phone and remote organized next to my bed, but you can't run the charge wire through is as if you pick up the phone the whole station comes with it.
2141	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very strong and absolutely waterproof box. It's somewhat heavy but that speaks quality. You can run it over with a car and it won't break. It's not very big so if you're planning to put a camera and a phone in it, get a larger one.
3377	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this for my wii and it is a great cable. Lets you play your came in HD so the picture is crystal clear. You can really tell the difference in HD and regular wii cord.
8331	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought the n82 a month ago. It's a good device,
At home in Alaska, the 3 1/2 hour trip from my home to Anchorage normally has a number of holes in service where my phone is not operational. While using this booster, there is only one short space where I have no signal at all, and that is at the bottom of a canyon and is to be expected. Having this booster makes me much safer when traveling alone, and much more productive when riding as a passenger.
Currently this is not the best cell phone on the market but this is definitely one of the best Tmobile GSM phones at the moment.  With rebates this phone will only cost $50 which is well worth the price of cancelling your old account and starting up a new one.

There is only one super-small issue that shouldn't be a big deal and might happen with other phones too - when someone texts you, and you don't reply but you DO see the message that was sent, the phone acts like you never saw the message and counts it as a missed message.
1790	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had.  The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too.  Also beware of the so-called rebate.  If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.
7719	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Decent phone case with a unique look.  Smelled like a strong chemical when I first received it, but it wore off after a few days.  The white does attract dirt, but can be easily cleaned.  This case does not have any "lip" on the front, so it will not protect against scratches if you lay the phone face down.  It was strong enough to last a few months of moderate use before I switched to a new case.

Speaker button is great for dialing, then I switch to the headset - I don't like the load dialing tones in my ear when using the headset.
2617	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost. No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone, Sennheiser, BlueParrot, Motorolla, Blue Trek, and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser, but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.
639	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Sorry to say that the product didn't even charge from day one. It plugged in. Lit up and when I came to check there was no power. So connect to charger again and same thing. After 5 times, gave up and returned. May be I just got a lemon. I don't know but don't want to try again.

Now just so everyone knows, this device can charge ANYTHING that has a USB cable that can plug into it.  iPad's, Android tablets, Bluetooth headsets, etc.  Just be weary that this device pushes 1amp.  Some devices only need 500ma, or others need 2amps.  Keep that in mind in the speed that your devices will charge.  Also know that if you have a device that only takes 500ma and you plug in the 1amp, you run the risk of damaging the devices battery (not the iTorch) and/or the device itself.

having your cell calls automatically come onto the phones is like magic, and these worked from 2 rooms away from the transmitter.

The battery comes with a few adaptors so you can use it with Android or IOS based devices, assuming the Android devices are using the standard micro usb plugs. It does require that you use your existing cable from your iDevice so don't be peeved when you don't see one in the packaging.

8445	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My stock battery was really becoming a nuisance. It wasn't even lasting two hours. Additionally, there are supposed to be 2 points of percent battery charge to give you fair time to be alerted and plug into power. First you're supposed to get a Low-Battery Alarm at 10% followed by a Critical-Battery Alarm at 3%. At the Low-Battery Alarm, I have a wav file which gives me a clear indication I need to head to a power outlet. One would think I could get up out of my chair, walk into the next room and plug in. Wrong! My old battery went into total nosedive mode and I hit the two warnings Bang-Bang and laptop was dead. Now this new battery provides over 3 hours worth of power. Tonight I've been using my laptop for 1.5 hours and the battery icon says I still have 68% or 2:15 hours left. Wow!! I really hope this battery maintains this trend! It gets my vote!!!
I wish I had known the Jawbone was all utter hype before getting fleeced by Aliph for $149.50!  This earplug is extremely difficult to get on the ear. I had to fight with my Verizon UT6700 to get it working and most of all the sound was little better than the UT6700, which is disastrous!

It was between the Treo 755p and the Centro.  Went with the Centro for the smaller size.  I was able to transfer everything over from my Treo and with only a couple of problems. My Real Estate program had to be updated. Everything is working properly now.  Kinoma on the Centro is a nice program with the EVDO network. Check it out to make your new phone a media playing machine.
The first is powering on. As others have noted, there is a bit of a "thump" sound through the speakers when the LiquidAux finishes pairing with my phone.  The louder you have your stereo turned up, obviously the worse this is.  But it lets me know that I can start my phone playing.  Of course, I can also have my phone playing through its built in speaker when I get into the car, and as soon as power-up/pairing occurs, the sound will automatically start playing through the speakers.  There is also a slight thump between tracks.
It has been a life saver on campus when I don't have time to go back to my dorm to charge my devices, iPhone, iPad etc.. Really recommend it.
There are negatives of course (two major gripes: short battery life, hangs sometime at menu button), but again, it's 5 stars considering price/functionality. Id be willing to buy it's next incarnation even if only the hangs/bugs (firmware update is useless) and some hardware (processor, battery) are improved, and everything else stays, incl price, the same.

5208	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	UPDATE: i was able to connect this device only to the Sony ericcson phone and this device has failed to connect to any other phone after that. I have tried multiple brands of phones like Nokia, LG etc but none of them seem to connect to this device even though the phones seem to support this device. So, this was a complete waste of my money. I have not used this device in 2 years because of this issue. Infact i have a similar problem with my other Jabra Bluetooth headset. It connected to my Nokia E71 and refuses to connect to any other device!

Very much worth for the amount you pay. This is a very good product.
With all of these caveats, you should note that you will absolutely be able to get usable cell data in places you normally would not. The cradle is also very easily portable from vehicle to vehicle or to take hiking. weBoost has excellent support for their products if and when you need it. Just go in with realistic expectations and understand that different carriers have different coverage areas.

5125	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Small, clear video, great audio quality. Phone doubles all Tracfone purchased minutes and bonus minutes will be added to that (i.e. purchase a one year 400 minutes card with a 200 minutes promotional code, and you'll have 1000 minutes to use within one year - longer if additional time/minutes are purchased). Easy to add phone book - can store multiple phone numbers under one contact name. Easy to take pictures, but have to use the web to email the pictures to store on your own computer - no direct connect to a computer. Battery was properly charged and drained several times, but even in standby drains fast, only having 2-3 days standby time. My replaced Kyocera (provided free by Verizon) provided strong standby power for more than a week; You have to use a Tracfone phone with Tracfone. Activate phone with Tracfone online and receive 20 initial minutes. My minutes were not applied automatically, as expected when  activating online, but I had to call tech support. Tech support was called several times, for both pre-sale and after purchase support; there was never a wait time and the personnel were excellent. I had 1st ordered the phone direct from Tracfone and then found that Amazon gave a better price. I called Tracfone to cancel the order, and although it had shipped, they gave full credit - all I had to do was refuse the phone when delivered by FedEx. Once upon a time I made good use of my Verizon plan, but for a long time had little and seldom need for monthly use. For several years I paid Verizon $30 a month for a few minutes used over a year's time, and incurred roaming charges. With Tracfone, I purchase minutes per year (1000 for $99), no roaming charges, and none of those phone charge taxes that can increase your bill 20% or more. An assortment of cards for various minutes/time are available. Tracfone buys minutes from all the major cell phone networks like Alltel, Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, so I expect to be able to use my card while on vacation in Anchorage without incurring roaming charges. This is a single rate phone: This means that roaming, long distance, and even International Long distance is the same rate, one unit per minute. Tracfone seamlessly  managed the cancellation of my Verizon plan and retention of my cell phone number. The phone is full featured - free caller id, mailbox, minutes available. I'm only disappointed with the short battery life. As I don't use the phone frequently, I only know that that standby time is short, and do not have experience on how long the battery performs during talk time. The phone advertises talk time over 2.5 hours and standby time up to 250 hours. I need to check the warranty for battery replacement. You'll find more information about TracFone at [...]

I also want to mention that originally I though the light and laser pointer on this device were pointless, but just the other day I used the laser pointer for a presentation... it actually came in handy.  As I use the device I will add updates to the capacity of the battery and if it deteriorates or not.
This is a standard procedure you have to do with any BlueTooth earpiece device. So no difference.
The only thing that takes a little getting used to is when you receive a call, you hit the button on the Bluetooth headset and you have to wait a fraction of a second for it to beep, then say hello.  I found myself saying hello a couple of times at first but now I am used to it, that is a small difference between Bluetooth and a wired headset.  As I said before, the battery life on this unit is amazing, yet it is extremely light weight on your ear, with  above average call clarity, that alone lets me award this headset five stars.
I was able to clip the speakerphone onto the visor OVER the CD wallet thing.  The clip is very flexible.  The face of it acts as a universal button for power on/off and making/ending calls.
Overall, a great product and worth the price I paid for it.
On the other hand, there is a convenient configurable menu on another button from which you can select the features you actually use. That does soften my complaints in the previous paragraph - except for the AT&T logo button starting the browser.

excellent sound for both voice and music
This phone does have a 40 chord Midi capability which means you can download some good songs.  For the tech savvy there is a program called Easy GPRS which can be downloaded from Samsung's European website. This program will allow you sync up your phone with your pc.  The other program which I like is called PSM Play which allows you to edit midi files and convert them into mmf. files.

Bulky:  Looks like a mini-laptop but won't fir easily in your pocket...Case/Belt Clip is a MUST
I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.  Not the smallest/best coolest phone, but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO.
1551	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is my first Bluetooth headset.  I purchased it because it seemed to get the most positive reviews out of all that I looked at.  It has performed very well.  People say they can here me as well if not better than when I use the phone itself.  I would recommend it.
Start > Settings > Personal > Today -- change this to Windows Default.
Note: neither procedure is explained in the manual for the headset which came with the unit (or the downloadable manual from the Jabra website for that matter. That is inexcusable in my opinion. The manual on the web should be made up to date by a manufacturer at the very least).
Some have complained about their systems throwing up a flag/ warning that it is not an OEM battery--- for me when I installed Windows 7 it got rid of all of the bloatware that comes preinstalled, including some of the Lenovo utilities that are not needed. So with that, I do not get any messages and this is the first time in a long time that the battery will show "plugged in, not charging" as the battery has held a charge nicely. If it can stay this way and I even get half of the life as I did my original--- I would give it ten stars as for under $30 it in a matter of words "made my day".
The 510, on the other hand, I can use in busy and very loud airports and restaurants with almost no trouble and it handles wind marvelously.
Honestly, if it wasn't for the fuse issue I would be able to recommend this to others, but there have to be better options out there for the same price.

Pros- Easy to use- Qwerty keyboard-Mp3 player-Built in Stereo speakers- Great camera for stills or movie-Large Screen- Bluetooth is painless and easy to pair.

6229	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love this little compact powerhouse.  I actually own the older unit so my review is based on that.  After experiencing my share of a dead Droid, dying iPad2 and MP3 player and at the mercy of an available power outlet, I decided to take "charge" of things.  Saw this little unit on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  As soon as I got it, I knew it would be love at first sight.  I packed it on a couple of trips I took recently, knowing that I would be out all day away from any type of power outlet.  As soon as my phone was dying, I plugged it into the iTorch and I was off to the races again.  I could utilize my phone right then and there or I could have just let it sit in my pack and charge up. Yes, you have to charge the unit up prior to use but its a small inconvenience compared to being at the mercy of a power outlet or even solar charger. If I could make this unit even better, I would include a hard case with a wider selection of plug adapters rather than a carrying pouch and a couple of adapters.
6675	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	A signal booster can, at best, act only as a signal booster. It can't create a signal that isn't there and even at its best you can't expect it to boost a barely there signal to something thats going to rival your wifi network speed wise.

Although I can't rely on it 100%, I always take my phone when backpacking in remote locations. Of course it's useless with a dead battery so this will really come in handy on future trips. I believe this is their smallest unit, somewhere around 4oz so it won't upset even my lightweight pack and gear.
battery life has been pretty decent, but what is awesome is the standby time. i rarely make calls and I get over a week on standby (in area with a strong signal). If you hold the phone by the bottom, the signal does not get lower.

Price
4. No volume adjustment on the headset; you need to adjust volume directly on the phone. Headset only has a single multifunction button (I had guessed there'd be at least 2 looking at images)


lo and behold! I have signal now, I can make and receive call, and use internet (GPRS), and I can use 2 phones at a time (both use T-Mobile)
Took a long time for earpiece to soften or maybe my ear confored to it.

It also comes with other accesories such as a 2 mg memory card and a USB cable, which is kinda cool. Most of my other hones I had never came with that cable so I would have to go out and buy it, but with this phone, it comes with it!

Most, but not all Palm apps will transfer nicely over to the Centro.  This is a huge benefit if you've got a bunch of Palm apps already, like I do.  Out of the box, you can put all those apps on it, and have a phone more useful than any iPhone or BlackBerry out there.  And if you've got a wireless keyboard, that'll work with the Centro, too, meaning you can use it for larger e-mails and working on Word documents (Oh, did I mention that Documents to Go is included in the box? :))
* Battery life is excellent!  It lasts much longer than the battery on my cell phone and I like the ability to charge it from my laptop's USB port, a car charger or from AC.

9005	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	bought this for some extra ipod time on my plane trip to france last year. gives you about 2 extra charges on an ipod and about 1 1/2-2 charges for iphone. easy to use.

6687	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have one of these units at my work and a z-boost unit at home.  To be honest, they seem to work equally well.  But, after a year and some months, I had a problem with this Wilson unit.  I called customer support and actually talked to a helpful person located in the US!  He offered to replace the main component for free even though it was out of warranty. When it came I hooked it up and everything works great again.  And, I actually got a call a week later from the same tech support guy asking if everything was working OK!

Here are my summarized pros and cons:
1. Nice design. Very stylish and sleek.
Here is what I experienced in the last year:
Very light weight, includes manual and recharge cable. Indicator light shows status of charge.
- Definitely makes the phone much more stylish.
I was first drawn to this because it's red. I'll be honest. Then I realized that it was small. And then, inexpensive. So I bought it to use with my iPhone.


* "Dual slider" design: Slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (Play/Pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).  Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.

6979	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	wonderful


Sound quality is OK- ambient noise will overwhelm it.  Wind noise makes it cut out in 1-2 second instances making it unusable outside when there is a breeze.
If you just purchased your iPhone and want to connect your old favorite mobile phone or home headset (from your previous mobile phone for example) this is NOT what you need.  Most likely, your headset has a 2.5mm plug, not this 3.5mm plug.
7300	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	there was no user guide and the phone looked like it was used. Didn't expect it to be that big and with very crappy ring tones.

Highly reconnended

5850	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This phone is great at doing what phones should do best -- calling and receiving calls.  I purchased a Motorola F3 for a great price just before a trip to Nicaragua in 2009.  I purchased a SIM card at the airport in Managua, loaded minutes onto the phone, and didn't have any problems.  It was much cheaper than adding international service through my carrier in the US.  The battery life on this phone is excellent.  I'm thinking about upgrading phones to one that has better texting capabilities and one that isn't quite so old.  Overall, this is a great, inexpensive phone.  It worked great for me in high humidity and it's very slim, so it's great if you plan to keep it in your pocket while you travel.

I asked them if it felt right to them that I paid $130 (Best Buy) for their headset and then have to bend the pieces that come with it and buy a competitor's ear gel just to make it comfortable.  They didn't seem to have a problem with it.

Con:
9605	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I read the reviews before I bought this product so I had an expectation that in my environment it would work correctly....and it did.  It's important that you can find a signal sweet spot...most likely outside of your house...that is within 30 to 50 feet of the area where you want to boost your signal.  For technical reasons you need a separation between where the receiving antenna is located and where you want to place the associated amplifier.  I was told by the tech dept you can locate the receiving antenna further than 50 feet away but there is a cost signal wise that is about 7db...appox 1 bar on most phones... for each 100 feet.  In my case the cable length needed to be 62 feet (I had to put a 12 foot extension on the 50 feet supplied) to allow my receiving antenna to be in the best sweet spot I could find on my property.  The sweet spot was a location that was between -82db and -85db which is about 4 bars on most cell phones.  The line of sight is about 30 feet away from my inside problem area but in order to run the cables I needed about 62 total feet of cable.  The end result was that although my cable needed to be longer...the signal strength at my sweet spot was way more than enough to offset the extra cable length signal loss.  The bottom line is I have a wonderful signal where I used to not be able to talk inside my house.  I placed the inside amp box near where I previously had no signal.  I recommend this product to those who have a sweet spot they want to "move" inside.  If you do not have enough signal anywhere then do not buy this product.  This product simply allows one to move the best signal to a new location...but that location has to be within a reasonable distance away.  One more note...it is very important to take a lot of time to find the best sweet spot you can find.  Most cell phones can be put in a mode where you can see the signal strength in decibels rather than bars....the lower the decibel number the better.  You need to know that it takes most cell phones 15 seconds or more to update those numbers so finding the absolute best sweet spot is not always fast.  Sometimes 1 foot movement can make a huge difference signal wise so take your time to locate where your receiving antenna should be mounted.  Also it helps to know where your cell phone transmitting tower is and point the receiving antenna towards that tower.  This might be a problem for some consumers to find but if you do know the direction of your cell phone company's tower you can fine tune signal reception in a fringe area.  I suspect that if you find a sweet spot of 4 bars or more the actual location of the tower will not be a huge problem but it certainly will help.  None of this is hard to do and it really makes a difference between getting a fantastic signal inside to just a marginal one.  The 30 day guarantee is great for those who cannot make this product work in their location.  Well worth the money.

I would like to see the cables built in like some of their other products, but love the fact that there are cables included with a small carrying pouch.

1098	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I rarely use my phone hands free for more than a few minutes and don't like the bluetooth hassles. I keep one of these in all my jacket pockets, hang one from the rear view mirror on the car and one or two around the house.  They last forever and no one ever complains that they can't hear what im saying.  On the odd time I use my motorcycle, it also fits easily under the helmet and if its a longer trip, i just take a small (easy to remove!) band aid and tape the mike to my cheek.
-It doesnt come with a wall outlet, or a cable for the apple products such as iphone which is annoying but it does work with the cable apple gives so that not to bad.
SE: 9/10 Shine: 1/10

The buttons on the side are very inconvenient.  You can accidentally press the power button, which can turn the phone off, on, or put it in different modes depending on how many times you press the button.  I had my phone in silent mode in a movie theater, but the button was pressed while in my pocket and it turned the sound on.  Very embarrassing.

One great feature that's fairly rare among headsets which is included on the H700 is "mute", which can be accessed simply by hitting both volume buttons at once.

I don't have trouble with dropping calls very often, but range, signal strength and dead zones have always been a problem. With this Drive 4G-S booster installed and working, that problem has virtually been eliminated. With my minor reconfiguration, entry into the backseat is no problem and the weBoost Drive 4G-S Antenna Booster works just as advertised. Highly recommended!
6081	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have had IMP52D for the last few days and I have to say- it's one of the best chargers I have used. The biggest thing I noticed right off the bat was how small it was. Much smaller then I was expecting. The size makes it easy to carry around in pocket, briefcase or just about anything. The size also makes it really nice to be able to have it charging a device and leave them connected in pocket without a bunch of bulk.
The microphone on this device is very weak.  Callers cannot hear me but I can hear them loud and clear transmitted through my car stereo.  I can also hear the driving directions loud and clear.  Device will mute Pandora when the next direction comes up, and then resume to the music.  All in all, I am a satisfied customer.

8771	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This product is cheaply made and TOO small for both my Samsung Intercept AND my credit cards! Therefore, it doesn't serve its purpose and is useless to me.

PRO :  new flat antenna works with phones that no longer have a car adapter
7954	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Shipping service is terrible.  Don't expect to receive your order for at least 2 weeks.  Product feels cheaply made, like the wire will snap at any moment, and above all, it does not work if you need all 4 channels.


5817	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	was looking for a replacement and was surprise how much it was going for so i had to buy two
Fortunately, I had absolutely zero installation problems and no leaks. Everything has been working wonderfully. I've held back 1 star because while the description and name of the product implies my water pressure should improve, ours did not. But water pressure solutions were not something we were looking for, but rather, a more broad approach to water coverage. And for this, the Thunderhead worked perfectly.
The unit doesn't feel cheap, is moderately weighted according to appearance, and has a really nice smell to it.
And I've had mine for over two years without any problems. I accidentally forgot I left it in my sweatshirt pocket and WASHED IT, and it still works!  I couldn't believe it.  Sure, the battery life suffers after years of use, but they're so cheap that it's no problem at all to get a new one.


Got it. It came in a plastic sleeve inside a bubble-wrap envelope, not OEM plastic packaging or anything. Still, I rammed it in, kept the phone off, charged it overnight. It ran from Thursday morning until Tuesday with low-moderate call usage when it finally started beeping at me to put it back on a charger. Now the only catch is if it will be a short-lived happiness and the battery will die out quickly. I'm going to do the proper full-charge, full-drain treatment for the first few and we'll see. I will update if there is a problem.
Flimsy, weak magnet, cheaply made, garbage at its finest!
  The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear.
Truth.

This little tool solves that problem and also ensures that I am able to safely push food stuff into the garbage disposal without accidentally trimming my nails or fingers.

This is a much better phone than any of the Treos I owned.  I won't bore you with a lot of subjective jabber, instead I will list it's strengths:

I used to own a jabra that had the bud that stuck in your ear and would hurt my ear from the direct sound coming into my ear. I have also had numerous wired headsets and my wife has the pink motorola h500 which has tons of background noise.

I called Garmin support and they are sending out a new one. Since I had it for over a year and their support is awesome I rated it 4 stars. Since it broke I couldn't give it 5.
Cost:  $25 to activate/prepay/load phone.  The $25 covered the activation and purchased her 200 minutes.  All that I have to do is add $10 every 90 days so that her minutes don't expire.  Now THAT is perfect!
6618	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bottom line: Went from a useless one bar to 4 or 5 bars. Calls would drop. G3 internet access took 2 minutes to load a page. We chose Wilson on its reputation. Now we have fast reliable access. My wife's office is 14 feet below ground, under three feet of steel beams, under a reinforced concrete parking lot. I ran 50 feet of PVC conduit and Wilson's cable above the ceiling (with owners permission) over and under the steel beams to the nearest outside wall. Outside had 5 bars. Tested unit with all 50 feet of the Wilson cable and had 4 or 5 bars on both Verizon and AT&T. I needed an additional 25 feet of 1 GHz Radio Shack low loss (7 dB per 100 ft) cable to bring the unit to its permanent position. Required only minor adjustment of the gain controls from the test positions. We have three bars out in the hallway, and three bars in the bathroom down the hallway, or almost 1000 sq ft of usable signal area. It took 2 hours to run the 50 ft of conduit through what looked like a Hollywood horror movie set, and 5 minutes to assemble everything else and adjust the gain controls. Good job, Wilson! Verizon customer service put me on hold for 20 minutes when I tried to ask permission to turn it on, as the Wilson manual required. Then Verizon wanted to get me an internet booster. No clue about Wilson cel phone signal boosters. Bad job, Verizon. The MyVerizon forum had a posting that approved consumer devices now have blanket permission. When I checked, the cel phone service at the outside antenna was great on both Verizon and AT&T. Oh, yeah. I'm an engineer, but I also have social skills, and a very happy wife.  :-)


- I have to reboot the phone 2-3 times a week on average because it would just freeze.  Sometimes it comes in clusters where I'm rebooting 3 times a day!  It almost always happens when I need to make back-to-back calls and/or when I happen to place a call at the same time it tries to synch with the server.  I don't want to have to wait 15 seconds between the calls.
I only have 1 con to this fantastic device
Cons:

I took it out of its packaging and in seconds had it installed. It fit perfect. It is a quality product. It is well designed and produced.  It is definitely an idea that achieves its intent of protection of the expensive and vulnerable product inside. It looks great and feels great. It offers no impedance of use. I am very satisfied in my decision to purchase this product.
* I was able to recharge my Galaxy Nexus 3 times (consecutive days), and the battery pack still had charge left in it (2 indicator LEDs were on, so approx. half the charge I think)
Initially the call button didn't do anything when paired with my EVO but after the Froyo update (which brought a wealth of Bluetooth stack improvements) it now works like any standard Bluetooth hands-free dialing button. The remote uses a small watch battery and I've only replaced it once in over a year of use (cost me $0.50). The main Bluetooth receiver unit plugs into your 12V adapter obviously so you never have to worry about recharging it, that's another advantage over the Scosche.
8493	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is one awesome little phone. First of all the screen is the brightest and most detailed I have found on any phone. In the store it is so bright it just screams at you. I have found that reducing the brightness to 70% is more than adequate. If you have trouble reading a phone in direct sunlight, fear no more. As for features, there are just too many to mention. I first learned about it from the Toyota website as I just bought a Prius. It is one of the VERY few phones that will integrate seamlessly with the car. It can even upload its phone book via Bluetooth to the car. Most phones (except smart phones/PDA's) will not. They are also 3 times the price. It has a great sounding MP3 player. It is stereo Bluetooth, FM radio...I could go on and on. There are some great themes free online so you can customize away. If there was one gripe it would be that it doesn't come with an M2 memory card which it needs if you are going to load up on music and photos. I can't complain though as this phone is very affordable. Some complaints I have heard are that the number keys are too small. Well, I'm 6'2" and about 280lbs. (not a small guy) and I don't have any problem getting my fingers to work the buttons. The other complaint I have heard about is battery life. Well I have talked and talked and played with this thing for 3 days now, and the battery is still more than half. I'm not sure what people think is good, but after my RAZR...pffft...this thing is great. My techie coworkers were amazed by the display and all agreed that it was unbelievably bright. I would recommend this jewel to anyone who wants a great phone that has a lot of cool features. It blows away the Samsung SCH-a737 and the LG Shine. Go to a local AT&T store and play with one. Then buy one at whatever outlet suits you.

Seller ships quickly, but there is no tracking ability, and they ship the battery strip in a standard letter-size envelope.
Hey it is a camera phone!  It does what it is designed to do.
The one I purchased at the store is a lot less "plasticky" than the one I ordered on-line.  It just seems less-than-coincidental that i recieved two in a row that were malfunctioning significantly.

I was really hoping the Jawbone would be the killer noise reducing BT headset, but it's not cancelling noise either. And yes - I have the nub touching my cheek. My wife said she could hear all the noise in the background clearly, so I had her use it and sure enough - I could hear everything.

(Bluetooth would cut out and lock up my home screen when I carried phone in back pocket. Other times it would behave ok.  Also, the Tone would not work with out going calls--I could hear the other person, but they could not hear me.) I've read about others having this same problem, even with other brand phones. And plusses of the LG over the Motorola were not worth the hassle of trying to figure out of this could be remedied. In fact, others I read about could not find a fix for the problem.
3994	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I never even bought this
Con:

However, it WILL NOT sync up to a Nokia or LG phone.  I've had both a Nokia (forget the model number) and now an LG-CU500, and neither will recognize it.  It is incredibly frustrating.




6472	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works. Keeps a call miles beyond where I usually lose calls into the mountains. A little tricky to set up the cradle
Long winded power on: This is a pretty silly preference, but they are long in the tooth when turned on.  Sometimes if I'm in mid call and turn these on, I want to connect right away, but I have to wait for (and read this out loud so you can see how long it takes), "(Bingy sound effect that plays for about 1 second) Welcome to the Motorola Buds.  Device one connected."  This power on cycle takes roughly six seconds, during which phone audio cannot be heard.
As you can tell, I am. If you are in the market for additional car charging ports - I highly recommend this.
5935	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I had been monitoring larger mobile chargers to replace my old Kensington and came across the New Trent iTorch. What grabbed me is the combination of mobile charger, flashlight AND laser pointer. You can find a lot of units with the flashlight, but the integrated laser pointer is pretty rare and eliminates the need for yet another gadget.
Pros:
- Great build quality
The Jawbone has excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. The person on the other end thought I was on a landline phone. On my end the caller comes in loud and clear. I even turned on a vacuum cleaner and stood next to it and the other person did not hear it at all. You can adjust the volume, but I let the headset do that. Somehow it senses the noise level around you and adjusts the volume accordingly for both you and the person you are calling.
just as well at home.

4522	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I use this bluetooth headset with my personal cell phone (a Blackberry 8120) and my business cell phone (a Motorola v195s).  It was very easy to pair the headset with both phones and it's amazing how easily the headset adapts to which phone is in use.  I frequently participate in conference calls using the headset and battery life is quite sufficient and the voice quality seems to be adequate.  The only complaint I've received from callers is the noise they hear when I answer calls by extending the slide piece, so I just try to answer calls by pressing the button instead.  The volume and mute buttons are easily accessed and work well.  I use the headset without an over-the-ear piece, and although it tends to "droop" a bit during a call, the headset stays well enough in place that it causes no problems for me.  Since this is my first headset, I don't have much to compare to, but it works well for me and I'm not always easy to please.
4171	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought theis headset because of other reviews and a recomendation from the salesman that sold me my phone. I have owned more than 6 Bluetooth headsets and this by far has the worst audio quality of any headset I have ever owned. The first call received was while I was at A restaurant in the waiting area with lots of chatter going on between patrons. he caller commented immediatly about the noise and I could barely hear him. I made another call from my vehicle after dining, and the audio quality at the receiver's end was so poor that the person I called asked me to get off  the headsset so he could understand me and even with the audio turned all the way up on my Blackberry Pearl, I could barely hear him.
Despite of the fact that it doesn't have 3G, I've decided to buy it and the reason is that I don't really need the 3G most of the times. Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy.

1145	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.
1. The manual was confusing. It was easier for me than some people would find it, since I have technical experience with computers, networks, etc.
-Stylish (compared to a Treo and lots of other smart phones)
And, one more thing. I am no longer bothered by what I called back in 2008 'weird format'. It's something you get used to. After all, Thinkpads were never meant to be fashion statements.


You need to be a surgeon to pull out the memory card and the sim card.
I took it on my 2-week trip to Peru: a 4-day Inca Trail trek to Machu Picchu, and a 1-week stay at the Peruvian Amazon Forest lodge, Inca Terra, and was never once disappointed. It charged my Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone, and 2 iPod Touch devices.
It sounds a little hollow though.  Folks can tell when I'm hands free.
Must to make sure it wasn't chance or error my wife and I drove the same route we get little to no signal in separate cars.  I used the drive booster and she didn't.  We did 3 trials. First just watching signal strength. Second was call quality. Third was data.  To avoid tangles with the law, my son and daughter were our lab partners.  The booster was consistently 1 to 2 bars stronger or had bars when the other didn't.  Call quality was a push and data followed signal strength.
* The multimedia software is excellent; both on the device and on the desktop. You can watch movies, listen to MP3s and check out your photos on the handset. The Music software is not as good as what's on the Sony Walkman w580i phone, but it gets the job done. The Roxio-powered Media Manager software for the desktop offers super-easy drag and drop of MP3s and movies. It even converts files on the fly so they work with the Curve. This is one of the best additions to BlackBerry. The easy to use  interface really turns this into a multimedia device.
9889	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	this screen protection is for the blackberry curve i got only 3 in the pack i only used 1 to put on works great !
Here are lesser cons that can be worked around: The beauty of these palm phones is that they're so popular; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter, and they've written software to address / fix / work around the issue.  For example, I found that the phone's volume is not loud enough.  There is 3rd party volume software to fix that, as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem for your computer.  Some software is freeware, some is shareware, and some is for purchase.  The key is that there are so many forums and resources on the Internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need, and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home PC.
4047	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was a little apprehended reading all the bad reviews but was determined to follow the good advices and it does work as designed. My unit is functioning properly upon receipt. We do not like all the wires which must be camouflaged or painted or something. I stuck the window unit from the window upstairs. The wire and antenna were dropped out and sneaked back into my first floor window where I usually use the cell phones. All windows can still be closed shut as the wire is very thin and can extend up to 20 feet. This would create the required 10 ft bettween the base and the antenna. Reception is great in our area for both Sprint and ATT except for my house. I have Sprint and we have been struggling for 7 months until I get this unit. It will go to 2 measly bars when I stay close to the black antenna and calls will not be dropped. That's all I can ask for compared to constantly dropped calls and no reception before. Upstairs would not be as bad, but downstairs greatly benefit from this unit. I was planning on getting the expensive whole house unit, but after the husband complained about "I making more work for him installing the unit", I got this small thing and did it myself. Hah! there, it works and I did it myself and it's cheap. If the light blinked red and won't quit, just unplug and plug it back in to reset. I did not expect much and therefore I am pretty pleased with this unit.
2596	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Plantronics is the best headsets. I have used their products for years and have never been disappointed with their quality and performance.

*My PC puts off a large magnetic field so I no longer have that sitting next to me.
With the a120s I get about 40 feet away line of site (cubicles) or less than 20 feet through standard home walls. With the CyberBlue dongle however, I can use it all the way into the restroom which is over 60' away & through 2 walls & a bathroom stall.

7764	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to use with my iPhone 3G. I have had a difficult time finding a device to use with my phone. Some keep losing the connection. Some won't connect at all. So far this works every time and sounds very good.
this cheap with adhesive in my $25,000 car, now this messy glue is here to stay.
5627	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very good product and arrived on time.
9533	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I purchase this booster in hopes of boosting an already low signal it made no difference. You must have a fairly good signal in order for this to work. These boosters are intended for good outside signal and poor inside signal strength due to building materials. The quality of the kit seemed to be very good if I would of had a stronger signal.

7054	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Almost the same battery life, but it did bring my old phone back to life.
small, lightweight, easy to carry with you on short trips, daily, etc.
8306	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Its a good price for a car charger for my Pearl (8130) and i love it because it is neat, and i don't have wires everywhere in my truck ^_^
The adhesive was not strong enough to  stick on to the cell phone
Using this pad to me is like using Super Glue with a release when needed.
I have been using this phone for several months now so I am over the wow phase of having a true MP3 player in the phone.  While this phone does have many unique features, the overall execution makes this just an average phone.

7428	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have had both the original size jawbone and the newer smaller version.  This original size fits my ear perfectly.  I often cannot remember to remove it when not in use.  Works well and I seldom get complaints from the person on the other end except for wind noise.

6377	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I received my phone case about three months ago and couldn't believe that it was real leather!  I kept smelling it and joking with my kids.  The clip was a little tight and fitting my LG Voyager was a little snug at first, but after a day or so of taking the phone in and out of the case, it loosened up just fine (that's what leather does!)  The fabric came off of the clip about a month ago, but it doesn't affect the performance and the case hides the metal clip, so no one can see it.  I really couldn't be happier with the case.  I bought a cheap vinyl one at a mall kiosk a year ago that cost four times more and wasn't half the quality. If the belt clip had a better cover it would be a five star rating!


All in all, price, quality and quickness of shipping, I certainly recommend this ear bud to anyone who needs a 2.5 plug for their cell phone's ear piece connector.
  Next, I tried my iPhone. It will bring an iPhone from nearly dead to full charge twice with one fully charged iTorch.

I also have 3 Ereaders in my family and the IMP500 will be used to charge those as well.  I'm planning on using it to do my Nook Color, and will also use it to charge my kids Pandigital Planets.  Update: I have now utilized it for these ereaders and it works fine.  The charge time is a little longer though.  It's slower than the original charger but when your on the road that's OK.  By the way depending on how I'm using my ereader I'll attach the IMP500 while I use it.  This way the charge on the unit stays longer and I'm sort of running of the eternal battery at the start of the day.
6511	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This did not work for my T-MOBILE NETWORK So I bought "Nextivity Cel-Fi RS2 Cell Phone Signal Booster for T-Mobile Only" and this works great just have to Google research about products that will work with your network and read product reviews
4371	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This thing doesn't even fit the Credit card slot they give you.  if you put a card in it, the flap won't button.. i don't know how this thing passed QC.  If you have an iphone 5 do not buy this as it will not fit the dang thing.
4# Because the Treo's are of the Candy-Bar style design, they are much easier to talk on. Because there is no flip, or antenna to fumble with.
But the battery on the Nokia Xpress seems to last longer. I have been using it all morning long listening to the mp3 player as I type this and it's still at a full bar.

923	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	They feel well made, though I can't really speak on the durability(I've only had them a couple days). Clean sound with nice(not too much) bass. I'd buy them again.
Thoughts about newer Treo phones:  The 650 now costs a little less because the Treo 700w and 700p have come out.  This is a good thing, because I don't see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a "must".  Other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface, and higher resolution camera, the phone's features are basically identical.  Also, as of the Summer 2006, the Treo 700 is only available on CDMA networks.  The Treo folks have staggered the release of GSM and CDMA models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity.
I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.
1) No wires, and the batteries last about 7 hours (I tried using them all day at work)
- Piano finish attract finger prints and scratches all over the body
quick and courteous service.
If it had been accurately described, I would not have purchased it!
3862	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Thank you the item was received it was 100% satisfied with the item the one that received it was very happy as well thanks
4474	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Not made anymore, so one could not buy it anyway.
7434	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	good
Things have appeared on my bill for a year that shouldn't be there. I have made 5 attempts to fix this and finally gave up. Plan on a two-hour call to get something accomplished and then prepare yourself to be utterly crazed with anger when you see that nothing was actually done several times. A lady from Sprint called me trying to sell something and extend my contract, I laughed so hard, that she actually tried to fix my problems. She said she did and of course, it's still on my bill.
3280	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Very good case fit Nexus 4 very well. The kick stand is difficult to open but works well after filing down a bit.

5) Voice memo.. nuf said
2) Volume buttons are loose and feel cheap, although the main function button is fine.
5718	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Perfecto reemplazo.

Pros:

6811	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	nice for the price
The bottom line.  Same great RAZR.  Much better built quality.  Improved sound.  2 giant screens.  You cannot go wrong with this phone.  You get what you paid for.
Pros:

3043	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This item was recommended by Amazon ad for BOSS audio, when I took the BOSS & all the other items recommended to operate with the BOSS to a Professional Installing Company whom are located Nationwide, they stated "this harness WILL NOT work properly with your 2004 Silverado diesel HD" especially if you want the volume & channel changer on your steering wheel to work..  The product (harness) needed to work with the BOSS is a SOSCHE ID#: GM1583B which worked perfectly.  There is also another wire harness needed to connect your steering wheel to the radio which is called a PAC ID#: SWIRC.  If there is a NEXT time, I'll do research in depth.  Good Luck

9075	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The IMP52D is pretty much perfect! I have recently became a huge fan of
First of all, if you wear glasses, this is not the headset for you. I tried not wearing my glasses, though, and still I could not get it to comfortably stay on my head. It came with four ear buds, and only one performed moderately--again, it would not go on my head comfortably nor in my ear. I tried using it without the ear loop, but the bud was not sufficient to hold the unit on my head. I watched the advertisements for it, and saw how lovely the Noise Shield should be, but when I tested it, the performance wasn't too different from other headsets. Others told me I still sounded like I was on speaker-phone. It too was troubling having only a volume up button. Sometimes it was too loud, and I had to remove my phone from my pocket while driving to turn it down. But, didn't I buy the headset so I wouldn't have to use my phone? Very disappointed. I would recommend the headset to people with very large ears, who don't wear glasses, make no facial expressions (smiling also moved the headset off my ear), and make minimal head movements.
And 12/31/2012 I still use same set of batteries.

7406	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was hoping my iPhone with its soft case would fit in this, but it doesn't.  Not the fault of the item, though.  I bought this to use for hiking and camping exclusively, and as such, I have not evaluated it yet.
Camera Feature- This camera is a 2 megapixel camera which puts out very decent pictures and the flash is very bright for just 1 LED light.  For the upgraded software there is a video feature for the phone but there is a problem with the feature.  If you don't have a memory card you won't be able to use the video feature because you get a message saying " To record a video, insert a formatted media card.  Then there is digital zoom in the phone which works pretty good and unlike most digital zoom out there you don't to really worry about blurred pictures if u move during the time your taking the picture.  I would give it 5 stars.

There seems to be some differences with the pictures on Amazon and the model I received.  Mine used all 4 LEDs to indicate battery level.  Power button is something I had to get used to (pressing 1 to charge, then another one to turn on laser pointer, another one to turn the laser pointer off; press & hold 2 seconds to turn power off; press & hold 3 seconds to turn on/off the flashlight).  I can see how button could break and become an issue as some people noted.  I used it just about a month, but no issue so far once I got used to it and hope button doesn't break.  USB input seemed a bit too tight at 1st, but after some use, it got a lot better.  Since it is portable, I rather it be tight than loose.
The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don't plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.

3388	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This cable works fine, and it's a lot cheaper than the official Nintendo one. Good quality. Orange and red tips are hard to tell apart, but otherwise no complaints.
6302	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have now been using the iMax Power for several months and I LOVE IT!  This was the single best investment I have ever made.  It works.  I mean, it really works!  I have had three other iPhone/iPod Touch backup power supplies and each one croaked early on (one with in a few days, one a couple of weeks, one just lost juice day by day by day).  Needless to say, each was a severe disappointment.
- Included micro-usb cable to charge



Feature-wise the Cobra does a good job of covering the basics - a full channel selection for all VHF channels, plus NOAA weather.  The squelch is not infinitely adjustable, but has a couple of "steps" controlled by a single button.  There is no scan feature (unlike the Uniden, which will scan as many channels as you choose in memory on a continuous basis).





The voice quality is good, I haven't had any complaints and most people can't tell I'm on a bluetooth.
5226	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My mom loved it.

6881	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The batteries works well, as expected.
Not the most comfortable headset I've tried. Prefer the in-ear like the Sony HBH-IV835 but I decided to keep this one instead as DSP might suck.



I would definitely buy this product again!

This has the standard 120v 2 prongs, rounded 220-240v 2 prongs as well as the 3 angular prongs. It can also accept inputs from all types of electrical cord. In other words, you can use this in any country with any consumer electronic device. It also has a builtin fuse that should, at least in theory, protect your electrical devices such as a laptop computer whenever there is an electric surge.
If you get this you'll be surprised at how useful it can become in little to no time.

The H710 is, by default, loud and clear. In normal use, you'll never have to turn up the volume. It holds a charge as well as any other I've used. I really like the little flap that folds under the ear piece when you want to turn it off. I can then put my 'beetle' in my pocket and not worry about mistakingly redial someone. Plus it saves on the battery! When I ready to use it again, I unfold the flap, it auto connects to my blackberry and I'm ready to use it. I recharge it about every 2-3 days under normal use.

7716	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I absolutely love this case.  It's super classy, fits well and protects the phone from side drops with rubberized sides.  The wood inlay is beautiful and authentic.  You can feel the grain in the wood and can see the depth of the wood when looking at the engraved Boxwave logo.  I always place my phone face down now, in public, so people can see the classy case.  Silly, I know.  It's just so nice, I like to show it off.  The only thing that would make me love this case more is if it came in Zebrawood.  Some other brands do carry Zebrawood, but this one seemed to be the greatest qualtiy case, IMO.  You can't go wrong with this case.
2734	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Bought this as an upgrade from the 650.  It is actually a downgrade though, the software from Microsoft is horrible compared to the Palm, so the 700 with Palm might be better.  When on the phone the software will 'go places', i.e. it will open up programs, when the messages or phone rings it will open the volume control, and will not close it.
722	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Item fit perfectly.  I have an older Chevrolet pickup and wanted to replace the front speakers.  This connector worked perfectly with no wire splicing.  Had the new speakers installed in minutes.
All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use.  The is sound quality not worth the pain.



Original Review:

941	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	These things are amazing. I love them! The one downside is this...if you're going to talk on the phone with these, the person on the other end is going to think you are in a train station. They desperately need noise canceling. I haven't found a single pair of bluetooth headphones yet that sound decent to talk on. I can hear fine, and the person on the other end can hear me fine....but they can hear everything else around me to such a degree that it's bothersome and distracting.

Blue tooth headsets, I found, are a very personal thing.  Some did not fit 'right' and one gave me an earache. The Plantronics 330 fits me the best and once I became accustomed to putting it on, I can do it with one hand.
4983	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I thought I would need one of these for my iPhone in order to use a headset with a normal 1/4 inch jack. WRONG! my Sony's work just fine without this convertor. Don't waste your money, not that it's a lot, you just don't need one....
2132	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The case is made of high quality leather with quality stitching.  It's the type of high end case that normally retails for 24.99 to 29.99 from a name brand manufacturer.  If you're considering this case for something other than a Palm device, rest assured it WILL fit the AT&T 8525 or TILT just fine.  In fact, if you look at the pictures, it's a perfect fit.  The shipping on this item was reasonable and quick and the price for it is unbeatable.  You can't get this high quality a case at those mall kiosks that will still sell for $12 ~ $17 anyway.
I have an RC helicopter that has a Flybarless main controller that is connected to a PC using a USB cable for programming.  It is mounted on the helicopter in a manner that makes it difficult to get to the plug when I need to adjust it.  This adapter really helps with the problem, by plugging this into the controller, and then my cable into the adapter, I can easily get to and work with my unit now.
I then at night just plug the Trent device into a PC or A USB wall charger and my Phone gets plugged into the Trent IMP500.  In the morning both are fully charge and ready to go for a full/heavy day of usage.
9645	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Batteries are batteries what else can I say, but they work.
- confusing button to turn things on
I'M ON MY THIRD DAY without recharging the unit. I use it at least 2 hours/day.
The reception on the ear piece is clear and loud. The microphone works flawlessly to faithfully relay your voice to the receiving end without little or no distortion or muffles.
The mute/power button is ridiculously small and tough to operate.
9835	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Item was exactly as described and worked perfectly with my Seiko 7N43-9070, plus I have plenty more replacement batteries for the future.  Great value, really can't beat it.

4307	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The unit came and right out of the box it had a rattling noise inside. I would've kept it but was bothering me when driving and I need to turn my head left and right.
Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.
1401	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Have many year still works great.
- micro usb charger  port


If you have a phone or any other mobile device that charges via USB, you need this!
4597	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	loved the look and specs, hated the lack of performance.  Bought for my BlackBerry 8320, blew up every UMA-based call I tried (and only BT headset I've tried that did that), marginal quality on cell-based calls, poor range.  Brilliant on/off feature, loved design and comfort, fit, just wish it worked.
1. Chargepod with 6 Adapters - No, the unit does have 6 Ports, but only came with 1 Adpater!
2772	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Does not hold a charge.  Charge gone in about 4 minutes.
Fingerprints/Scratchability: The claims that the Shine is a fingerprint magnet could not be more true. The Shine cannot stand to be touched at all. Walking around with the Shine put in my side jeans pocket for a day, the Shine went in looking stellar and came back looking pretty poor. The back plate had obviously been rubbed on, the front plate exhibited small, but noticeable scratches. I'm sure you could prevent the Shine from getting scratched by getting a screen protector and/or case, but the hassle of one is not something that I'd want to deal with (not to mention such protection would take away the "beauty" of the Shine). The Sony Ericsson, as one may predict, does not scratch easily. Same jeans, same walk, and the SE still looked great after. There was something that looked like a small scratch on the front screen on the SE, but nothing a wipe could clean off. Speaking of which, with the LG Shine, you cannot wipe the phone with any shirt; it will scratch if the fabric of the cloth/shirt is rough. A BIG reason people get the Shine is because it looks good. Well, if you don't take care of it like a newborn baby, it's going to look like **** and ipso facto, it was a poor decision to buy the phone for its looks.

1709	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Arrived damaged. Deployed and not feasible for me to return. I got it because it would work internationally, which it did...but it was still damanged.

In terms of comfort, Plantronics provides three styles of earbuds: small, medium, and a triangle-shaped larger one. After trying them all, I prefer the medium-sized bud -- I can keep the headset in my ear for over an hour without any discomfort, and sometimes I forget i am wearing it. Admittedly, it took me a while to figure out how to put in on with one hand, but I soon got the hang of it. It now takes me no more than 2 seconds to put it on. (Hint: Hold the earbud/boom-mic section with your thumb and middle finger, and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger. Place the earbud in your ear, and then remove your forefinger and let the back section naturally fall back behind your ear. It sounds more complicated than it is, but it takes some getting used to.)
Cons:
9463	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Kind of works. You have to be pretty close to the base station to see improvement. I don't really recommend
6962	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great service and great product!
9779	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Fast shipping via Amazon prime. Batteries are first rate, and work well. Super value!

1735	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone. I've owned a Timeport, v66, and v600. The Timeport was simply terrible. The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable. It's nice not having to carry around an extra charger when I'm already lugging around my laptop and its power supply.
- Very compact. Put it in a pocket and don't even realize it!
I returned it immediately, and did not spend much time with other features.  The display is brighter than the older Nokia 2610, although scan lines are occasionally visible.  The menu speed is also slightly improved from the 2610, although still slower than any of the low-price Ericsson models.

Strong tie cord.
I can't speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it's ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn't take long, either.
I previously tried the "Body Glove Clip-On" - this was a good case which adds a lot of protection for the BB, however, I found the clip on the Body Glove to be too small and therefor a major pain whenever I attempted to reattach my phone back to the swiveling detacheable clip (the clip was attached to my belt)-this was why I quit using this.  A good case would be a combination of the two - the Body Glove Case with the clip from the holster.
779	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	ok

It occasionally goes through a connection losing spat- it must be powered off for a few minutes when it does this.  It happens every few weeks and is SUPER ANNOYING. I have read other reviews that voice this issue.  The benefits outweigh the annoyance for me.  It would be a five were it not for the disconnect issue.
Sound quality is OK- ambient noise will overwhelm it.  Wind noise makes it cut out in 1-2 second instances making it unusable outside when there is a breeze.
True, they offer the Live TV and Sirius which I couldn't live without now that I'm spoiled.

578	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent fit and feel.
3. Voice activated dialing works, so it is convenient to call someone while driving.
The second flaw this product has, although this might be a little more like a double edged sword, is the fact that after 30 seconds of not using the device to charge your electronic, it shuts off. This is great as it helps conserve battery( which we all so desperately need) but in the case of an emergency in which you've managed to turn on the flash light, you will only have it on for thirty seconds. The same applies to the laser pointer.

The covers for the charging port and the head phone jack is cool. I sometimes take it off when in No danger of dropping it on a hard surface because I love the way the Nexus 4 feels without it, but when I need protection, I put it on. It slips on and off easily and had a good feel to it. Like I said before, it is a little bulky, but it needs to be for good protection. The price was awesome and the shipping was awesome. If you have a Nexus 4, this is the case you need.
1919	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	With TPU cases it's usually a hit or miss.  With this one, my Nexus 7 is a happy tablet.  The back area has a flat, slick, X area while most of the sides retain a textured area that works very well when holding in your hand.  I often surf the web or watch videos while in bed and have had no problems with the case being slippy.  For the money this is a great case and probably the best you will get under $10.

I've owned a Palm IIIxe, Palm Tungsten C, iPAQ rx4240 and have test driven an iPhone, Blackjack II and Moto Q, and a couple Blackberry models.  The Palm Centro is probably the smallest screen of them all save the Blackberry Pearl.  However, the Centro offers 320 x 320 resolution which is higher than most Windows Mobile smartphones and PDAs out there.  The result is a small, but crisp display with adjustable font sizes for most applications.  I found the touchscreen to be about as sensitive as other Palm devices in the past, which is to say it's fine (see stylus comments below).  The screen is slightly recessed into the phone which I find to be necessary so I don't hit the screen with my fat face while talking on it.
1468	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The positive reviews are accurate - this is a great product - very easy to hear and people on the other end can hear me well. The ear piece fits securely and comfortably. What more could you ask? Highly recommended.
Another minor inconvinence with this phone is the phone's IrDa capability with your PC.  As I have mentioned already you will need to download an application from Samsung Europe in order to transfer data from your PC to your Phone.  With some other phones such as the Sony Ericcson T610 you can simply transfer files through Window's default program when you match your phone's infra red port with your laptop's.  Of course EasyGPRS also have the ability to do many other things but sometimes I wish that I can transfer simple images/sounds directly using just windows.
So far, no problems, but I suspect that it will eventually wear out.

Even though the features are minimal, you can tell much thought went into the design of these features. The USB outlets are on the same side and close to each other. The product itself has a nice curve and shape to it. The power button is small but prominent - i like how it sits flush with the product so that it doesn't accidentally get pressed, but its also easy to find and press if the device is in a bag or in the dark.

9251	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have this phone and was debating on whether to exchange it or not for something a little simpler. I decided to keep it because it's that "candy bar" style, no sliding or flipping up to use and am happy with it for the most part. It took some time getting used to. I don't like the fact that there is no "back" button. I love the touch screen. I find myself trying to use the touch screen on my husbands phone (Blackberry 8110) or my kids (LG Shine). Battery life is pretty good. I had a Samsung M300 and that thing needed charging every day. I charge this about every 4 days. One thing I discovered is the my ringer volume got softer/low after about a month. At first I thought it was my imagination. I could've sworn it was louder than what it was. Even on the highest level I could barely hear it. After researching from other users, I took out the battery and re-inserted. Now that's the ringer volume that I remember having.  It saved me a trip to AT&T.

4742	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After testing and trialing so many different headsets, from Motorolas to Plantronics to Sony Erricsons to Jabras, I had a very good Motorola with great comfort, battery life, sound and microphone quality. But the only drawback was when on the highway, people heard a lot of background noise still, and I use my headset a lot like this. So when I heard from my friend about his Jawbone, and I heard him use it while in the car, and how it sounded better than his actual phone, I realized I needed to change.
I hesitated to write about this until now, because every time I talked up the greatness of a product, it literally died the next day or week.  So, now, since I have had this for almost four months, I can safely say THIS THING ROCKS!
4958	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Not adaptable for Square credit card swipe. Adaptable only for headphone. Need more information on the website guideline on this product.

5849	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got it for emergency used when I was working in a very harsh environment! The phone is basic but doing its job VERY GOOD! Battery used to last about 7 days without charging and with more than average use. Have got a small sleeve for it and it was dropped many times. Still in the drawer. It makes a good basic phone for making and receiving calls.
The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement, but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.
If the Razor had the same features, that would still be my phone.
Go for it and enjoy!

I knock off a star not for the very plausible prospect that the problem could lie with the phone manufacturer, but for the less than cordial attitude.  Refusing to even troubleshoot a product is called passing the buck.  For all they knew, it very well could have been a defective unit but they were too quick to dismiss me to know for sure.

I originally learned of the accessory power device for iPods from an ad for the Richard Solo unit - a fancy $50 device made of brushed steel with a built-in laser pointer or something. The problem with that, though, is when it is attached to the Touch it blocks the headphone port - there is no cable as it is apparently designed to add a couple of inches of length to the unit (it was really made for the iPhone, where I presume one would be holding the phone next to one's face or using a Bluetooth earpiece).

The phone stays paired until you move out of range or turn off the Jabra SP5050. The range is pretty far. I had my phone sitting on my desk near the window facing the street. My car was parked on the street in front of my house--they stayed paired overnight and drained the batteries on both devices. I now make sure to turn off the Jabra SP5050 when I leave the car. It does turn itself off when the phone goes out of range for 15 minutes in case you forget.

3601	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	BoxWave BodySuit case for Galaxy S4 turned out to be much better than I expected, especially for the price tag it has. It's not very flexible but not too hard either. It fits  perfectly to the phone with all ports aligned properly with the case. Bought another case of same brand in different style.
Audio quality is great.  First, unlike my 2008 RAV4 factory bluetooth which is very good, the Parrot is FULL DUPLEX which means both of you can talk at the same time which allows much smoother conversations.  It has the magic DSP background noise elimination so callers don't hear the road noise.  All the echo is cancelled as well, and your voice is processed to remain strong and loud despite being distant from the microphone.  Callers tell me I sound like I am directly talking on the phone and not on a speaker phone.  The Parrot audio amp which sends sound to the car speakers does have a small amount of high frequency hiss/noise in the background; however this isn't a problem as you can only hear it when the engine is shut off.
Other than the issues I have with powering on the battery pack, the workmanship and quality of this device far surpasses any battery pack I've owned previously. Its also a bargain compared to the other packs I've bought. I would gladly take this, or even 2 of these, over one or 2 of the 10,000mA ones I own. And I've already done this too :)

So you want to place the inside antenna in an area that you frequently use the phone, other than that it works as advertised!!! Clear as a bell and never have to ask...can you hear me anymore!!!

Crappy Universal Adapter Cables

While it did not come with a wall adapter, the iCarrier that I bought at the same time did and it is interchangeable, otherwise you can use your device charger and its USB cable. The product is simple and easy to use, no need to pack an instruction book, which is a bonus when you want to travel light. The added flashlight and laser pointer are just icing on the cake. I can't wait to take this and the  iCarrier IMP120D - (12000mAh) charger for a week long summer camp. I'm sure I will be supplying energy for my entire troop.

Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes.  This turns the headset on and off after pairing.  You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off.  If you don't wait for the flash, this will happen.  I've also heard this reported during pairing, but that shouldn't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off.  Finally, the volume buttons are easy to use.  I only use the headset on my right ear so I can't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.

Conclusion:
There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.

4041	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters, and I have to say, not one of them is worth a dime.  Do they boost your cell signal?  Maybe...a little....sort of... not really.  Yes, the bars on my Sprint phone do jump a tad when I turn this on, but it's barely noticeable and certainly not worth the exorbitant price.  This one just feels like tech snake-oil.  No, moving to different locations made no difference.  Nothing did.  This thing is just a placebo.  Don't bother.

1441	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I read a lot before buying this headset and was kind of nervous because some bad reviews I read but I must say it was worthy because this headset is really good, I can hear perfectly when using it, it doesn't hurts my ear or anything, I don't use it like everyday so the battery has last for almost a week so far. I have a samsung captivate and didn't had any problem pairing it and using it.


3289	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Fits perfect!
9999	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	good oem battery. There are some replacements that don't last. I'm happy with this one.
9690	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	great all around
I have been using PDAs and smartphones for almost 10 years, and always have used screen protectors whenever available.  This is simply the worst I've ever purchased.
The bad:
6815	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	They work like they are supposed to.
Nice to use, but directions could be better.  I figured it out quickly, but with the cost of ruining the inside screen protector.
I've made up my mind: with bluetooth headphones, you get what you pay for. I'm going for a Jawbone 2, spending the extra cash on it, and I have no doubt in my mind it will be everything the reviews say it is. Enough Samsung garbage. Should have known. There are no other Samsung products in my home, and nor will there ever be.
The battery is small enough (~1.5x3.5 inches) to fit in a small bag on my top tube along with my phone, energy bars, gels, etc. The matte black finish feels clean and helps me keep ahold of it even with sweaty hands. I sometimes ride at night and, while I have my own headlight, its nice to have a battery with me that has its own light. I'm not sure how I would detach my zip tied on light if I needed to change a tire, but the battery flashlight is more than adequate for that.

 - 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)


The microphone is not great, with low volume and average to low sensitivity.


The LED's (BB logo and LED inside pod) stay lit as long as it is plugged in and they DO NOT change colors when the phone is charged - they always remain white.
Ironically, the one thing that could have been better was call quality.  It's not terrible, and many would say it is just fine, but a higher-end phone like this could be a little better.
6272	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	It comes with a few adapters and will work with the iPhone usb cable. It is good for multiple devices where a single device power case will not work.
9237	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to put my cell  phone in to cover it up from the sun when I am at the pool. So far it has done the job.

Sound quality as well as volume is clear for both myself and the person on the other line.  And it looks great...not as bulky as the "over the ear" headsets.
 -Camera with video, even though with 3.2Megapixels, is easily usable in the same way as the N95.
7000	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I hate scratching,dropping, or in any way damaging a new phone! This product is straight from the God's and CHEAP!! Best money I've ever spent to protect my phone.

* Support for nearly every Bluetooh profile in existence: A2DP for stereo audio, DUN for tethering the phone's internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use), OBEX to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer.
I haven't tried the IM or Bluetooth features yet.
7307	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	As always this flip phone doesn't fail. Phone was brand new and works perfectly. Fired right up once I had to fiddle a bit with the sim card. Older sim cards are a bit thin I think so I just placed a thin piece of cardboard to wedge the sim card closer. Works great.
5024	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	don't waste your money
Well worth the money.

7753	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Many other folks have talked about all the different features of this unit, so here's my concise list of what I like about it:

The Jawbone CAN be a good and comfortable fit, if the anatomy of your ear agrees with it. I was lucky that way, it was actually the most comfortable headset I have used. Even for me, though, it was not "instant love", it took a bit of training to learn how to put it on correctly in a hurry (i.e. when receiving an incoming call). The ear loops (4 different ones included in the package) are very stiff, and I can see how they would easily break after a while. The sound quality was excellent while in my car driving - even across a noisy concrete bridge there would be no way for the other party to tell. Also, incoming sound quality was great - the volume adjusts based on background noise, and the ear plugs are rubberized and block most other noise. It is also a good-looking headset; it matched my phone (a black Nokia N95 8GB) quite well. My main two issues with it were the charging connector (a proprietary one, and only a USB charging cable was included; also not that easy to plug/unplug), and the fact that the power-on time (from off to connected) was a bit too long (timing it, I got anywhere from 9 to 13 seconds..). I prefer to keep my headset turned off when not in use (battery life, connection-time issues.. etc.)
Unfortunately, moving the antenna did not change anything.  The quick-start installation instructions say the antenna must be mounted at least 6 inches from a window; the user manual suggests 8-10 inches.  Within those parameters, the antenna is as far from the unit as it can be while still being mounted on the roof of my full-size car.
4924	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	A bit too tight for use with a Mophie iPhone case.  May do better with other cases as a headphone extender.
7026	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My husband loves these batteries. His old battery would only last about an hour. Since buying 2 of these batteries he is never off the phone. He can text and talk forever. Loves these batteries. lol...... Great price.  Worth every penny. Batteries last all night with serious texting and picture mail.
The device will easily last 3-4 days in standby mode with average usage.  The sound is excellent, and people who listen think I'm talking on a normal phone.  The range is great.  I can be about 50 feet away without a problem.
Thank you,
--the steel is the body and thin contruction is truly attractive and durable (so far). The thin-ness makes it perfect fit even in tight jeans, so helps you prevent losing this phone. No excuse to your boss for not carrying it everytime as well. If I am an IT director, I would be issuing this phone rather than the N95 that I see with our plant managers.
1372	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good customer service. never any issues. great about upgrades. Simple and Easy to get and new phone mailed and have simple instructions on how to setup your new phone.

8628	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Thank you do much for this belt clip replacement. Me and Mt friends clips Brooke and desperately need a replacement. And low and behold I found it here at Amazon. Thank you.
9185	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The IMP 50D from Newtrent is an excellent backup battery for my iPod Touch 4th gen 64gb It's well-built, solid construction, it's easy to use, charges quickly enough, it has excellent attachments for all devices. Customer service from Newtrent is the very best! I'm very pleased with their service. I can't say enough about how excellent their customer service is! They have spent many emails answering my questions and advising me on which battery would best suit my needs.  Shipping was lightning fast! The imp50D charges my iPod Touch three full charges on one battery charge!!  I would highly recommend their products to anyone needing a great backup battery at an affordable price!! These batteries a must for traveling or as a backup when an outlet isn't readily available. 5 stars!
Better that the other cheap tiny earpieces, but would pay what he did for it.
The other issue, that I have gotten used to, is the very tight fit for my iPhone 6. When putting the phone in the cradle, I have to push hard to get it to go in, while pushing up on the cradle from the bottom, being sure to not put pressure on the cables. When removing the phone from the cradle, I have found that I can pull the wings out to the side a little, giving more space for removing the phone.
I can't believe a company built their earlier reputation with a junk product such as this.  It has been fully replaced once, back to the store we bought it from at least another 4 times - and it just is no good.  I can hear callers fine but no matter what we do with the microphone, moving tweaking gain, even hanging off the visor in front pf my face, my callers hate it for all the background noise, tunnel sounds, static - the mike sucks on this thing.  If I wish for a conversation of any sort, I have to turn it off and put my phone to my ear as callers just can't understand what I am saying.
5263	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this for my mother who ONLY uses the phone for emergency calls.  It lasted her 3 uses and I had to buy her a replacement due to cheaper than dollar store quality.  I guess yiou get what you pay for :(
I have finally lernt my lesson>!
There's also an awesome camera. This phone was built around the camera. It's a 5MP digital camera, and like the Prada, has Schneider Kreuznauch-certified optics. For those who don't know about Schneider's optics, think Swarovski, Leica, Minox, Steiner, and Carl Zeiss, and you get an idea of the quality. the pictures came out great, and the video recording is some of the best I've seen for a camera phone, besting even some camcorders! Some have said the camera isn't that great compared to Sony Ericsson's or Nokia's N95, and if you don't know how to use it, it's not, but there's a lot of adjustments you can make to it to improve picture quality.
1. Haven't really found any yet.

*** 9 months later, as much as I love the features and looks of this product, I am more than surprised at having to replace it due to a malfunction. I looked for what failed and found the plug used to plug into your vehicle power source had failed internally. A broken solder joint inside the plug was the issue. I considered repairing the plug but it's not possible without removing the seal around the cord where it enters the plug. I guess you could cut off the plug and wire it directly if you wanted too, BUT that's a pain! :(

So when I found out that the Kindle 2 tip was a MicroUSB tip, I decided to give it a try.

3338	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works perfectly to hook a Wii U to an old CRT TV via component.
Excellent product and great price too.



I offered to buy one for my wife, but she doesn't want to lose her cute pink case (for her, form tends to outweigh function - pfft). So while she wears out charging cables (and then taking mine - arg) fighting to keep her battery charged, I just go about my day, smug in knowing that I'm fine with whatever charge I have until I can manage to get to a charger later in the day, or maybe even tomorrow.
1) Some people have complained that their phone won't activate touchtone menus.  My phone will activate touch-tone menus, but only in speakerphone mode.  When I'm not in speakerphone, menus won't recognize my tones.
1926	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I guess I would have rated this if I would have received the right product. Instead of getting the Nexus 7 Case, BoxWave sent me a case that looked like above, but was fitted for a Samsung Galaxy SIII Cell Phone. Clearly, someone just looked at the picture on the invoice and guessed at what product was ordered. Won't be ordering from this vendor again. I'm still waiting for my refund... And I'm still without a case. :/
The quality is great as it doesn't feel like cheap plastic. It has a nice solid but smooth texture to it.
5914	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Not much to say but that it works well.
I have the Plantronics Voyager, as well as several other headsets by BlueAnt, Jabra, and Motorola. I bought the Plantronics 925 and received a BlueAnt V1 after the Jawbone dispatched itself. The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Plantronics-Voyager-510-Bluetooth-Headset-with-Multipoint-Technology/dp/B0009B0IX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Plantronics-Discovery-925-Bluetooth-Headset-Black/dp/B001630QZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset (Black)</a>, the Jabra are much better quality head sets and  work distinctly better. I haven't tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BlueAnt-V1-Voice-Controlled-Bluetooth-Headset-Silver/dp/B001APH9GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BlueAnt  V1 Voice-Controlled Bluetooth Headset (Silver)</a>&nbsp;yet.  None of the headsets are any where near the "SHABBY JAWBONE" Category!  Aliph owns that one!
Lastly, the incoming voice quality is good enough for me. I mounted the LiquidAUX on the lower portion of the center stack, just above the cup holders and gear shift selector. It points towards me. I mention this to give you an indication of the mic's orientation. My voice is also a projecting one, so it helps my situation. I believe that coupled with the lower mount (decreased road and ambient noise) and my voice, people hear me fine. Again, this solution isn't aimed at voice calls in my opinion, and I would pay an extra $20 for a wireless mic that I can clip on my visor for a more robust voice call experience.
Overall I will never purchase from mobilecityonline again!
7798	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this ear piece and then read some reviews saying it was terrible.  However, I love it and I've had no problems with it.  Take these reviews with a grain of salt.  I like the fast quick-connect to my phone and the small compact size that allows it to fit right into my shirt pocket.  The ear piece is a great improvement over it's predecessor.  I recommend it to everyone and this seller.  The product was just as advertised and works wonderfully.



 I was EXTREMELY PLEASED with this item, because this is very helpful  for replying to e-mails on my iPod Touch. My fingers are large and a bit clumsy, and I used to get pretty irritated hitting the wrong keys all the time when typing. Dragging items takes a slight bit getting used to, because the key is TO NOT apply pressure, but lightly touch icons, screens, etc.
Overall, this is a good phone, if you have small fingers. The size of the keys and the layout make the phone a complete pain to use. Other than that, its a decent phone.
3395	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product, price, delivery time.... You do not have to spend $35 for a Wii product when you can spend at least 65% less money and get the same results.  I will buy from these guys again...
4978	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a no frill basic adapter that allows you to use a normal set of headphones on the 1G iPhone.  Don't expect too much, as it's a basic black cable, nothing fancy ... but it gets the job done.  The best part is that it's ONLY $3 and some change (includes shipping) versus some of those $10+ cords / adapter out there.
My wife could tell that I was calling from my car, but she didn't notice a difference between normal road noise and the Bluetooth reception.
  Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection.
393	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Really cute case, but extrremely hard to take off. I guess its a good thing that it secures the phone in case I drop my phone. Its cute but its also a struggle.
1084	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I couldn't be happier with this Blackberry. Cingular service is clear and I live in an area that all cell phone companies have reception issues.  I setup 4 email addresses and I receive mail from all 4 accounts seemlessly.  What a great invention especially for those of us that need to be in email contact for business reasons.
I had NOKIA and SONY ERICSSON before and used them for at least 2 years with no problem.

1879	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is the 4th Body Glove "cellsuit" case I've owned, not because any of them ever wore out or broke, but simply because I've bought them for four different phones.  I bought this one for my Motorola Razr.  The fit is perfect, all cut-ous line up with the phone ports, speakers, etc.  This phone actually fits the Razr slightly better than the Body Glove I use for my Motorola V551.

The music player is the big seller on this one, and doesn't disappoint. The 1GB card that it comes shipped with (installed) is enough for me right now, but I can tell I'll be upgrading to the 2GB card (about $24 on sale...) soon. Connecting to your PC through the included USB cord is simple and with XP, things pretty much recognized and synched without a problem. If you've navigated a cell phone menu and used a PC before, this shouldn't be a problem for you. Exporting video, images or music from your PC to the Nokia is very quick and easy.

6513	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I live in an apartment complex and a friend recommended this to me when I was having issues with my phone reception. after I hooked it up, my reception was greatly increased and no dropped calls!  This is definitely one of the best boosters available
6183	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The iTorch is a fairly compact battery pack. the package contains a velvet like bag for storing the iTorch, a microUSB cable, and a USB cable. along with a small instruction booklet.
5075	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This case fits the Navigon 7100 perfectly which is what I would expect since this product is from Navigon.
6060	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the iTorch as my sole means of charging a few separate devices since I received it. Namely, an iPod touch 5th Gen, a Verizon MiFi Jetpack, my Blackberry Curve, and an older iPod Touch (2nd Gen). The iTorch has delivered exactly what I was looking for in terms of allowing me to not have to find an outlet to recharge any of my devices. The capacity of the iTorch completely recharged my iPod 5th Gen twice, as well as recharging the older iPod Touch completely, and the iTorch still had some power remaining. This is more than adequete to get me through the day.
1438	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	He was a good product but first time problem in the installation until you hear the pieces and then solve the problem
3249	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have been searching high and low for a quality case for my note 2. This case seems flimsy and the design just dose not impress me. May be a personal thing however I discontinued use after one day.
1. in ear design(no hook) - I always hated having to wear a hook over your ear because It gets in the way when I wear my sunglasses

Here are some of the other features I really like:
5645	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This product fits the Igo exactly as it should and works as expected.  I have used Igo since before cell phones (except those from Apple) standardized on the micro-usb.
I have recommended this to other friends and co-workers as well to get rid of extra cords from the aux port.
Its a must have.

The camera (with built in steady flash-light) is 2.0 megapixel which is more than the 1.3mp Verizon version of this phone.  Highest resolution is 1600x1200 and I think the pictures look good for a camera phone, but of course it is not a digital camera substitute, though for me, it was my substitute for when I was in Europe and I'm happy with all pics, even at night.
2679	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I Love it! It's the Best!
- Sound quality is unparalled.  Compare it to other BT headsets, and you'll agree.
2) Moto Phone Tool software could not get the driver download.  I spent a few hours on the phone with Motorola support trying to get the Krzr driver download, so that the Moto Phone Tool would work with this phone. They say Moto had released 4.3 Phone Tool software, we spent many hours with Motorola support engieers and mangers, get the software updated to 4.3.5 but still no driver, I can not sync the phone book into the phone. Motorola support engineers suggest to pay Verizon $50 per month to enable the Internet, then sync the phone book over the Internet, instead of USB cable. We are not ready to do that. Even with level 3 support engineers and support managers, they can not provide a URL to download KRZR driver, or email us the driver.
- accessories (pouch and cords)
Pros:
If compact size is important to you and you have a smaller device that only requires a 1A charge, this is a very practical mobile charger for you.
5224	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	a great way for everyone to charge their items when visiting-can have al items organized back flips open for a multiple line  charger
1497	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I always check Consumer Reports for ratings before purchasing goods. They rated this bluetooth as a "Best Buy" and it was rated excellent for sound quality. I figured that to be the most important feature in a bluetooth headset, so I ordered one some months ago from a seller on Ebay (for the same price as the 2 I bought on Amazon). I LOVE mine...so, for Christmas I ordered one for my husband and one for his daughter--ad they both LOVE them, too. If I have any 'criticism' whatsoever, it is that the headset is easily 'bumped off' the ear by a coat collar, etc., but its not like you wouldn't notice it ;-). The sound quality is excellent--so much better than trying to hold a rigid cell phone up to your ear to try to hear someone talking. My husband has diminished hearing and this has been wonderful for him, as he can adjust the volume accordingly. In short, we think these are great! Not only that, the price on Amazon is less than 50% of the manufacturer's website price. It is an excellent buy in my opinion.
883	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	These are my wife's so my review is just from talking to her - not actually using.
This does come with a bonus Screen Protector, which is nice as a package deal.
Overall, I'd say wireless on a treadmill is worth the ear bruising. I can't count how many times I've accidentally hit the cord with my arm and sent my iPod flying across the room. I like to watch videos on it while on the treadmill and the bluetooth headphones make that a pleasant experience instead of constantly trying to watch the cord. People with larger heads need to know in advance that these will be tight on your ears.
This is not a phone for people who use it for work
4819	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Decent phone case with a unique look.  Smelled like a strong chemical when I first received it, but it wore off after a few days.  The white does attract dirt, but can be easily cleaned.  This case does not have any "lip" on the front, so it will not protect against scratches if you lay the phone face down.  It was strong enough to last a few months of moderate use before I switched to a new case.
7897	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	good item
* A 5MP camera with autofocus, LED flash, and VGA video recording, Carl Zeiss lens, and a 1/2.5" CCD (same as in most compact digital cameras).  Various shooting modes (macro, night, night portrait, sports, etc...), ISO control, flash control w/red-eye reduction.  Immediately send pictures via bluetooth, email, MMS, etc.

5101	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have the Samsung Blast and just as advertised this is the cord only and does not come with the software. I went to samsungs website and downloaded the PC suite in less than 2 mins I was transfering files from my pc to my phone. I've made 6 ringtones so far.
but this one has the latest 4.x firmware, which is pretty good and stable I think
2849	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Do. Not. Buy.

I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop.  I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear.
The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, "With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.


4513	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My Samsung SCH I760 easily links up with this device.  This revolutionary headset has attributed to me setting aside my mp3 player.  While the sound quality is good, but not great, the functionality to discreetly listen to music while on my break and being able to talk handsfree has easily made this bluetooth stereo headset a winner with me.

7413	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for my husband as his job sometimes is a hazard to his phone.  This case will hopefully negate those issues.  The phone fits quite snugly (it's already in an Insipio casing), so there's no worry about it rattling around inside the case. It's still possible to hear the phone ringing, but it's quite muted even on full volume. If the phone is on vibrate you will not notice calls/texts/alerts at all.  Headphones (the ear bud kind) store well inside the case, and the headphone jack makes them easy to use.  The little storage pocket also works well for holding cash or ID. The case is rather bulky and won't fit into a typical pant front or back pocket, and it can be a snug fit inside a leg cargo pocket.  The carabiner clips allow attachment to a belt, but that too can be awkward.  The screen is easily visible through the cover, and of course you can't get to any of the phone functions without first opening the case.  This case makes great protection (and added piece of mind) if your phone is going to be exposed to any less than friendly conditions.
If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.
Sincerely,
My Nokia N95 works like charm with this headset. This product changed my opinion about Motorola.
930	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Surprisingly comfortable. You can measure the reception with a broken ruler, though. If I have to hold my phone next to my ear to keep the audio from dropping, then you've failed at being wireless.
2454	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	These are part of the V-Cast Music Essentials kit and are are worthless if you want to use them anyplace that has any ambient noise. They seat in your ear worse than iPod headphones, which makes it impossible to use them on, say, the bus. What they were thinking, I'll never know. Somone is going to make a mint making in-ear adapters; Motorola would be well advised to just offer a microphone/clip thing you can plug a pair of decent in-ears into.  In the mean time, save your money.

2. It took some time for the case to charge the phone but this is my first charging case I have no comparison for this.
The way Aliph markets the Jawbone and at the price, no one should have to tweak one thing to make the headset work or fit.
2.  Poor outgoing sound - Everyone I talk to while using the Jawbone complains that there are echoes, and that I sound like I am talking from the bottom of the well.  This is exasperating.
Life for the past several years has me on the go daily.  It seems that Im always on the edge of no power with my Apple iPhone 5 battery.  I had just sent back the second bad external battery from a big external battery company called Anker and decided to go small.

Cons: it looks like 1980's costume jewelry, so forgeting that I'm wearing it can be embarrassing. It is costly, but worth the premium (tho I'd have a hard time justifying more than $90)

There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:
The good:
7755	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've had several bluetooth hadsets, several brands including other Motorola, but the H710 is the best I've used.  The sound is loud and clear, it is super easy to use and it doesn't cause the phone to call by itself.  Best of all, it is so comfortable I forget I'm wearing it!  I'm thinking I may give one as a gift, I like it that much.
+ Minimal bling appeal (blue light is not obtrusive)
Note 1: I initially questioned the need for a laser pointer in this battery charger, but I actually had a presentation that I had to make a couple of days after I got this charger, and luckily, I happened to have the charger in my laptop case - perfect! It made the presentation a little easier. Is it essential to have the laser pointer? Probably not (for most users), but for the ones that could use it, it is a good aide.
956	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	For years I have watched my husband struggle with his earbuds cord while cutting grass; which is why I decided to get the wireless headset.

One final question, does anyone know if these units have issues with being battery drainers? Seems I read that by a reviewer some where. Any comments would be great.
- The speaker on the SE kills that one which is on the Shine

5136	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Very handy.  The earpiece is comfortable, works even several rooms away, and voice quality is good.  I haven't yet checked the range of the handset, but it's probably even greater.  The number buttons are very small, which took some getting used to. My only gripe is that if you keep the earpiece on long enough for its battery to run down, you have to re-sync it with the handset by first deleting the earpiece from the list and then re-syncing it.
2500	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love this headset! As stated above, I returned the Plantronics model that everybody was raving about. The only model more archaic than the Plantronics 510 would have to be one of those hideous Jabra models :)

Con:

Blackberry Pearl 8130 Desktop Charger comes with an AC adaptor, a docking cradle and an USB data cable. It allows you charge your cell phone on the cradle with the USB data cable, and charge the extra battery with the AC adaptor. The USB data cable can sync info between your PC and your Blackberry cell phone as well. 3 functions in 1
2970	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The WEP200 is a great earpiece. My family is very hard on earpieces and we've broken units from several manufacturers including Bluespoon, Logitech, Motorola, Plantronics and Scala. After my wife's Plantronics earpiece died from a quick dip in a puddle, I started looking for a replacement. The Samsung was on sale and had decent ratings, so I thought I'd give it a try. After she'd had hers for a few months, I bought the red one for myself.

9110	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have the older version of this charger, which is a little larger and holds slightly less charge. I absolutely love this thing. I can't tell you often it's gotten my phone through a long day, either when I'm traveling or just out for the day and unable to get to a wall outlet. This battery can charge my phone three times (your mileage may vary) and I've also used it on flights for my ipad. Definitely a must have item if you'd be lost without your phone!

pressing and holding the button for various lengths of time to turn
3024	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The phone design, interface, features and voice quality are above average however, its an entirely different matter if you want to use this phone as a personal or business instrument.  Unless you use Windows, you're out of luck.  The only application made in the universe is one created by Samsung to sync up with Windows Outlook users.  Of course we all know that on the 8th day, Windows was created however... for those of use who oppose the assimilation and choose to use tools that improve quality of life, we're out of luck with this phone.
Other than this problem, it is a very nice looking case, very comfortable to hold, not bulky but protective--and great price.
The company has been very accommodating in the return.  The return has been smooth and I WOULD buy from them again.
3d games are great, this cell has an 3d chip, even quake has opengl acceleration, but there are few games that use this
9	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Another great product that my daughter she use it for a long time but now she has the iPhone 5c. Transaction went well and fast.
8039	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	First the phone could not connect to its own headset. Then it started missing buttons when dialing. Finally, it has stopped recharging the handset.
- Small, compact, and lightweight. Perfect for travel and everyday use.
3604	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I didn't feel that this was a very sturdy product. It felt very flimsy but I tried it and was afraid to drop phone.
BTW, you can multi task with PTunes.  It allows you to play music in the background as you play games, make notes etc.  Sprint and Palm get a bad rap, but this is a nice little device for the price.
3697	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Excellent headset.  Quick connection every time, clear reception and people tell me they hear perfectly when I'm talking.  I highly recommend it as a great headset for all day use.

833	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have owned LG HBS 700 and HBS 730.  As far as sound quality (earbuds and mic), comfortability, and water resistance (somewhat) Motorola Buds has the 700 and the 730 beat, they can not hold a candle to the overall qaulity of the Buds.
2397	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this for a friend of mine that has a Motorola KAZR phone.  It works great with the phone and he his pleased with it which might not seem too impressive but this is a very picky person!  I have a couple of Scala headsets (500 & 700) and he didn't like those.  I showed him several others and he was always saying they are too big, didn't look right or some other problem with them.  He saw this one and decided it was the right one.  I ordered it for him and help him set it up with his phone (pretty easy setup) and he's been enjoying it ever since.

i would like to review another review unit.
I have not had the battery long enough to speak to its power and life. If it fails me or does not deliver the powder advertised I will be sure to update that review.
I believe blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicate the charge available - when I first received the IMP52D, turning the battery pack on displayed blue light 2 - after about 3 hours of charging, turning on the battery pack displayed blue lights 2 & 3 - after about 5 hours of charging, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 illuminate when I turn the battery pack on -


Also unlike the 500, this was quiet and difficult to hear or be heard.  The 500 was loud with the jabba gel.

What we found is the coverage for both units is the same, one room. The number of coverage bars and dBm's were also the same, but for some reason the Wilson Electronics unit achieved higher data rates using Speedtest.
7052	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	price was right and works great....not for a cell phone but for another rechargeable battery use.  nice compact package for 1000mAH
6342	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I ordered 2 of these.  I bent the clip on mine the 2nd day I owned it, and I use it on a belt.  My wife uses hers to clip on the edge of her pocket and the clip wasn't strong enough to hold.  Neither case would hold a Samsung S3 with a cover on it, and I'm talking only a MyBat cover, not one of the bulletproof Mil-Spec ones.  If you're using a smaller smartphone, or don't mind removing the protective cover, it would be an OK case, but even then it would have the crappy clips.
682	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After buying a few of the cheap pads and being disappointed with them, I bought this. It is worth the money. It goes much longer between having to wipe it down. But yes, like any of these pads, you DO have to wipe them down because eventually dust will cling to the surface and you won't be sticking your device to the pad; you'll be sticking it to a layer of dust.
Cons:
3199	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	AGood stuff great quality s
Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.
794	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for adding a 12V socket inside the console of my 2007 4Runner. Found some nut online that gave step by step instructions with pictures of how to take it apart.
The directions in the Manual are easy to understand.  I like that it came with a carry pouch.  It fits into my purse or even in a pocket. It stayed charged for over twenty hours while running several devices. It was still charged when I went to bed.  The pointer worked great it has  good range.
- the only REALLY dissapointing thing is battery life, way under average for a Nokia (i charge it at every other day or more often).


iPhone next to inside antenna:
687	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	ok
5445	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very handy product.  I keep them on hand as there seems to be an unending number of uses for them.
Only 4-stars due to the whole Spanish manual/language thing.
It was working fine until a couple of days ago I hit a bump on my road bike and (as some else mentioned) the little circle part cracked. So every bump home would knock the unit out. However, the wrist strap saved it from hitting the ground!
Bluetooth
1. Its internal memory is only 64MB, which may be a problem for users who tend to upload too many third-party applications on their phones. I have about 7 third-party applications yet I have 17MB left which is quite impressive so for average or slightly heavy users (like me)memory shouldnt be a problem at all. For photos and videos the OS 4.3 of this phone can support upto 8GBs of external memory (microSD card). I use 4GB and its fantastic...I've managed to fill only 500 MB even after uploading several MP3s and a few videos and photos.
I like that it covered the providers logo at the bottom. So I basically debranded my phone! Yes!
1330	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've been using this phone for about three weeks on the T-Mobile system within CT and while travelling. It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.
I only put 4 stars because it does look a little cheap looking, but what do you expect with this much bling. ;o)
Not only is it designed well and fits great in my hand, but it has performed as necessary. My iPhone 4 is topped off very quickly and I no longer have to worry about using it too much during the day. The included charging cable works great and I normally charge it from my laptop while working at the office. The laser pointer is adequate, nothing special.
5606	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Background: Over the past two months, I have spent a great deal of time debating between whether to get the Sony Ericsson W580i or the LG Shine CU720. After making numerous threads at various forums regarding this question, reading countless reviews, watching many videos, looking at hundreds of pictures, and mapping out the pros and cons of each one multiple times, I have settled on the Sony Ericsson W580i. Since my family just got a family plan with ATT (3 lines/550 minutes shared) and one of my sisters got the Shine, I was able to do a comparison between the phones.
3247	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Holster does not hold phone securely.
thats it! or at least all I can think of

If you call them today, July 15'th 2008, you will get through the prompts until you are given a wait-time and then the systems tells you to call back later and hangs up on you. I'm not surprised at all. They got rid of 80 % of their customer service workforce.
GOOD QUALITY AND GOOD PROTECTION WONT FALL OFF THE ARM-BAND! :D
8483	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This radios work great and make an ideal back up to full power radio. It works as backup and something to carry around the boat.
4569	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Ended up throwing in to the garbage. Waste of money. Cover is very thin. There is no way to avoid having bubbles. Not recommended.
RESULT - installation was simple
The Plantronics was also great with respect to sound quality; I would say though that it did not quite beat the Jawbone while driving in a car.. (I did not try either one while walking outside in wind though). I did not quite like the large size though (my pockets are full enough already with my cell phone, keys, wallet...), and as someone mentioned, it would seem that it could easily wear out after prolonged pocket-use... Finally, I did not like the proprietary charging connector. (Give me standard mini-USB please; or else micro-USB will work too).
-Incredibly small and light-weight.
6460	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Pros: Size, color, US 3G, excellent reception, crystal clear calls, Nokia maps, Google maps (downloadable), bright large screen, large easy to use keypad, 5mp camera is excellent.
2383	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This Bluetooth is Very Good,
This device also includes a carrying case to keep the device protected when not in use.

The button on the top of the unit has multiple functions which include turning it on/off, turning on/off the laser pointer and turning on/off the LED flash light.  It is very handy to have a laser pointer on the device itself just because if you need one for a presentation or something its right there and you don't have to worry about caring yet another device, the size of the device as well makes it very comfortable to hold for a presentation or something.  The built in LED flash light I found VERY helpful for finding stuff in the dark or getting your way around in the dark. I have to admit it is a little cumbersome to turn on just because you can't actually turn it on while the device is on or charging a phone/tablet. To actually turn it on you have to first turn of the battery pack by holding the button for 3 seconds oh and  if you time this wrong you will turn on the laser thus having to start the process over again. Once you actually have the device off then you can hold the button for 3 seconds and it will turn on the flash light and to turn it off simply hold the button again for 3 seconds. As far as the amount of light it outputs, well its decent nothing to amazing, but it is enough to see where you are walking or find something in the dark.
The good:
-Very affordable
annoying confirmation screen after sending text messages
There are 10 different ringers also.
1) The Clip is SOOOO hard, you you to really struggle to snap it on your belt.
8891	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Love this product, its affordable and it charges my phone really quick. I use this mainly when i travel so i won't have to deal with finding an outlet in the airport.
Just flip the little mouthpiece back on the earpiece part to turn off.
9445	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Can't say it helps much. Had two bars, still have two. We may have slightly clearer sound. If it had been $50 would have felt better about this purchase.
As far as performance, I'm not sure I'm really seeing it. That's not because the booster isn't doing anything, it's more the result of my cell phone provider finally adding 4G to the nearest tower (and with the provider finally making good on the years-ago promise to get the part of the county I live in 4G covered). Had I tested this a few weeks back I would be able to report a more accurate result as I was definitely living in a 4G fringe area. So I'm going to have to wait a month or so until my next trip out to the "boonies" to see if this works as I expect it to.
8605	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Too big

charge my gadgets. But there's more to it than just accomplishing it's

All I was looking for was something small and light for one complete charge on my iPhone 5. So far, this charged my iPhone from 1% to 100% TWICE (once while phone was on, once while off for about 80% of the charging). I still have 1 light on the battery pack, so I bet I can get at least another 50% charge out of it.
3143	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The clips, which are made of plastic, are very fragile. They broke the first time I tried to remove the mount from one car to another.
2875	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	First things first... I did not purchase this through Amazon, but direct from Schiit.  But I'm anxious to leave a review and since I'm an Amazon Prime member AND Amazon sells the Magni 2 this seems like the perfect place to leave a review.
The audio seems a to have some static and the mic doesnt transfer you voice clearly.

* Convenient controls for volume, play/pause, track selection, EQ.

This is a pretty good case with an extended battery for the Galaxy S5 phone. This case replaces the back cover of your phone, and replaces the original battery with a larger one. At first it seemed to be off and not working as far as the percentage indicator goes, but after several days of use, it was clear that the battery was definitely lasting a lot longer. I can pretty much go double the time that I used to with the original battery, and on power save mode, even longer (even though the remaining battery life estimate may not be accurate).
3855	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great price, quick delivery.  Fits great.
341	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Battery charger up really nice used it at work all day long and at end of the day still had 70 percent left great cover also I would definitely recommend it
522	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	didn't work for me at all on my IPhone 5
4304	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a fantastic headset for use with a single device (phone, laptop/Skype, etc.).  It is better than all the others I tried, both in fit and sound quality.
3947	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is the second Scala 700 set that I've owned. The first one developed a crack right on the seam after less than a year of use (I didn't drop it). I tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working.



Compact and capable of recharging my iPhone multiple times. I no longer have to search the airport for power outlets.
- superb coverage: I travel coast to coast and even get service in the backwoods of rural Alabama (Costa Rica too)
1456	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this due to the law changing to hands free in my state.  I am not a big fan of bluetooth but I saw the writing on the wall so I read the reviews and picked this one.  I am glad I did! This was very very simple to set up and charged very quickly.  It synced easily with my android phone.  I like that it comes with various sizes ear buds so you can get the right fit. It stays securely on my ear and I never feel like it is flapping or going to fall off.  When I make calls, the person I am calling says I sound like I am talking directly on the handset so I am pleased.  I have not tried any of the voice command features yet so I cannot comment on those. Overall, I am pleased and would definitely recommend this headset!
9773	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	great deal-great price.  I am not sure what my husband wanted them for;however, he was satisfied-and that makes me happy.
CONS:
Pros -
3970	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Does what it is supposed to do. Wife loves it. Would be my second choice to a bluetooth stereo setup.
-has a high capacity for its size
4026	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is the right size product for me.  It will hold a nexus 4 with a slim case on it with no problems.  But, I like to hook my phone into my front pocket of my jeans and the clip was not attached very well.  Would like to see a better quality case to hold my phone without worrying about it ripping off when I'm working.  The belt loop may work, but I never tried it.
1278	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have Sony Ericsson W600i/S710 and HS850 works great. What we love  is folding boom, which saves lot of cell phone battery (fold it and turns off) When you get call just open boom and you are talking on headset. Voice quality is great in car (windows down) no background noise. It is best compare to Motorola HS801, HS820 and Tekkeon headsets we used in past. We just love how it is easy to turn headset off to save battery life of both devices. If you have problem with voice or connectivity you check your cell phone conversation volume (just press volume key when you are talking with someone to increase conversation volume just another way..)

Pros:
No regrets.
-Average call quality

3694	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My son really like this case he keepsit on his phone all the time. He wants all the characters.  Love the case

iTorch provides 5V/1A output and is compatible with most phones (I used it on Note 2, DroidX, BlackBerry Bold, & iPhone4).  It also works with tablets, but tablets usually require 5V/2A input and takes longer with 5V/1A (1st gen Kindle Fire took over 4 hours to charge from 30%).  I tried with AC that provides 5V/1A output.  Difference was about 10 mins.  iTorch seems as nearly efficient as AC.
Only complaint I have is that the iPhone has to be placed in a specific direction in order for the headphone jack to be useable.  I wish it was constructed so that the jack could be used no matter which way the iPhone was placed.
There are 2 versions, a 1900/850mhz version that will work IN THE UNITED STATES ONLY with a GSM provider like T-Mobile and AT&, and a 1800/900mhz that will NOT work in the US, it is meant for use in countries that use those frequencies. If you are dumb enough to purchase the US version and expect it to work in France or whatever hell hole you visit, you deserve to lose the money.

Then I remembered Otterbox from storing my camera gear.  I went to the website and sure enough they made a case for the BlackBerry.  I promptly ordered it.  I also pre-ordered a case for my iPod Touch.

4)Comes with more than basic ring tones. It comes with several (around 12) musical ring tones. Better yet, the ring tones comes out in a full stereo mode (or at least sounds like it).
6039	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Another solid product from NewTrent - I currently have the IMP1000 for comparison, even though the battery is not as large, I do enjoy the size and portability of the iTorch.  Right off the bat I am impressed, even the packaging looks solid.  Modern style with a fold out flap to show the true size of the product.  Even though I think most of their products are sold online, they don't skimp on the packaging; this is definitely ready to display in any retail store.
349	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	holds a charge and keeps my phone working all day long.  I would have given it 5 stars but the case is very slippery and I have already dropped it a few times.  I am looking at getting some grip tape or something to make it a little better.
Inside the box are 6 pieces of gear which must be set up in a specific sequence for the units to work properly.  The main unit, the "booster" is designed to sit only in front of a window.  It's a bulky unit weighing a few pounds and the size of a large hardcover book.  Depending on whether or not you have old windows with old glass or new "low-e" glass you may or may not be using the exterior antenna which is connected to the booster via a cable.
Same Palm interface
However, the Jabra gets one more star than the Roadster pro for overall features because it has a built in FM modulator allowing you to use it to transfer audio, be it a call or music, from your phone to your car audio speakers.  That being said, the Jabra FM modulator really only works if you are either in the middle of no-where or standing still because the FM channels all around you will overpower the Jabra as you drive along if you are anywhere metropolitan.
2693	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love this case.  It's not only rugged and durable but also very affordable.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs something sturdy but affordable.
- Good published battery life
The one negative is that the Jabra, like many other Bluetooth speaker phones, doesn't come with a wall charger, only one for the car, which I find inconvenient and clunky. I solved that problem by purchasing a PowerLine 12-volt DC-AC Power Socket right here at Amazon for $11.08. It performs very well. Though I wish there were a wall charger included with the Jabra, it wasn't a deal-breaker for me. For the money, this speaker phone has met all my expectations.
6262	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I highly recommend this product in terms of battery power versus the competition. For the size and price, this is the best extra battery on the market. However, the cable/cord and adapter provided with the product are substandard. The adapter piece does not fit in the phone port tightly, so it slips out when joggled. This makes it inconvenient to carry in one's purse or pocket while charging. It forces you to charge the phone out on a table or desk, which defeats the purpose of having a mobile battery. Eventually, the cable/cord I received with mine stopped working entirely. The company suggested I use my original iPhone cable. I needed that one for home AC charging, so I purchased a new iPhone cord from Apple to carry with the phone and battery pack. The Apple version is high quality and long lasting, but expensive and not as convenient to carry because it is not retractable. This would be a perfect product if a higher quality retractable cord and adapter piece came with it! I also would recommend that New-Trent consider offering this unit, along with the retractable cord and adapter piece, in different colors. They used to have it in white - now it appears to come in black only. With all the cool cases and colors people put on their iPhones and iPads now, the battery packs should be available to match.
Update:  2.11.15

3978	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The Supertooth Light is an incredible product! It just works - easy to pair, automatic connection when I turn it on, good sound quality. The battery life is terrific. I charge every week or so, but it has never run out of power. I use it every day. Went on vacation recently without a charger - no worry, it never lost power. The magnetic mount is great - when you flip the visor down to block the sun, you can just slide the unit around to the other side of the visor and keep on talking. I have a Blueant Z9 (great product) but rarely use it any more! Let's hear it for those Aussies!
* Good sound quality on both ends.
9355	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Became so hot it burnt my hand.  Don't think that's safe.
Soft, but hard. Thank you
8836	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Can't go wrong with tossing this is your bag before a trip or a conference where you need juice! Laser pointer is fun to mess with the cat with but the pack itself is too bulky to be used as a dedicated laser for meetings, etc. I guess it would work as a backup in a pinch but don't buy this for the pointer. The same can be said about the flashlight. The battery pack works great but you need to make sure your phone is good enough on 1A. Otherwise, this pack will drain faster than it can "re-fuel" your device. If that is the case, like say for my ATT S4 which needs 2.1A to rightfully charge, the best way to use it is with the phone turned off and charging, say mid-flight. Worked much better back on my S2 or my Fiancee's S3 (no our last name won't be Samsung).
2109	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	July 2007:
For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception, I don't think you can go too wrong with the V330.
For me its no problem after I figured this out, but as I said before I'd have to give it lower marks for being so sensitive over such small issues.
6226	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have a hobby as a podcast co-host/blogger with the subject in and around the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, CA.  Being in the parks all day covering news, photos, and sending messages over social media, such as Twitter, I would find that my iPhone battery would drain about halfway through the day.  Not good, when newsworthy stories happen all day long.
Bottom line, do a lot of signal monitoring with your cell to see if you can even use this device. If you decide it's a go, follow all the instructions and you should be fine.

The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.
I highly recommend this (1900 version) for T-Mobile users

Who designed the power/mute button?  Seriously?  You just about need a hydraulic press to turn the thing on.  The button doesn't "click" down very distinctly, so you have to just squeeze hard and watch for indicator lights to know when you're turning it on and off.  One other review stated that it's virtually impossible to turn on and off when it's on your head.  Truer words have never been spoken.

At this point, if it works as well as Wilson products have for me in the past, I pretty sure I won't be disappointed. At $200 it may seem a bit pricey, but for a business person, farmer, or builder (etc.) who depends on cell phone connectivity I think it's not too steep a price to pay.

The call quality is as good if not better than verizon (here in SF bay area) with fewer dropped calls.  The speaker volume is also really loud.  The screen is amazingly bright, much better than my Sony NX70.  Although resolution isn't hi-res, the quality is still surprisingly good, for pictures and video.  Email and web access is very fast on the sprint network, and the PDA seems very stable.  With the rebates, it's an awesome value.  Now that I have all my contacts accessible, I keep in touch with people more.  Get it.
It is a little difficult to use, but once it is on it is very comfortable. However you have to take it on and off to use the ridiculously small on/off button. Not good for anyone with large hands. The battery could last a little longer too.

Stuck them in a drawer, cuz I could not bear to throw them away as they were all over $200 each.  I bought a watch tool from Amazon and took the backs off of all of my SEIKO watches, tried some batteries I had (not correct size) and they all worked.  Now, all my watches work.

Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.
If you are just looking to connect a regular set of stereo headphones or computer speakers, try just plugging it in to the iPhone first as most of them work without any adaptor at all.
2940	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	While this product does charge our BB 8703e it does so in a flaky way.  You need to insert/remove the plug several times before the unit will start charging.
Think about it.  There was a time when phone companies were much more heavily regulated.  Then congress passed lots of new laws to change phone company regulation and allow more competition.  These laws are extremely complicated, and the congressmen needed help writing them.  So, the phone companies came to the rescue with teams of lobbyists to help write the new laws!

As for the Kindle - it has a great battery life, but it is great to have a backup should you forget to charge it. I read about this trick on a Kindle blog - and I bought the USB Sync Charge Cable (for Palm Zire 31 72 Tungsten E) and I now use this adapter cable to connect to the battery pack and it successfully charges my kindle!

After searching around the web for a while, I found that there's no "best choice" product for iPhone car mount. Even brand such as Kingston have people liking it and hating it. Knowing that they don't cost cheap, I looked for a cheap alternative. This one does the job well. Construction is not rock solid, but after you mount it on the windshield and you have your iPhone mounted, it holds pretty solid. It has cushioning so it won't scratch your gadget. The suction cup holds very well. I use it with Tom Tom app, Google maps, and to make hands-free calls. It makes a whole lot difference!

2738	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	It suppresses vocals but not completely. On some songs it suppresses upto 80% but on most of the songs its not even 25%. It feels as if it dims the vocals and amplifies the music a little bit but this product is USELESS to be used for karaoke. The worst part is I can't even return it.

To fix this problem I put my Creative Zen Vision:M 30gb mp3 player to stretch the leather out and let it sit there inside the leather case for 2 hours(you could also use your ipod or something similar in size just abit thicker in depth to stretch the case). Now your iphone 3g could easily come out of the case with no hassle.
SHAME on putting video on a cell phone that can't handle it, Motorola! If only you had "done the right thing" and kept video capability off the Moto Z9, I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ANY EXPECTATIONS THAT IT SHOULD WORK!!!


- Visit Palms Support Forums and educate yourself before you buy this phone!
The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because between the ball chain and cables it gets a bit cumbersome putting it on and taking it off but I might work a system out that might be better. Right now I actually just loop the cable for the right earbud down and feed the cable through so all I have is the loop of cable to put over my head.
Pros:

If you are in a hot state, as I said, avoid it.
1097	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Pros
I bought this unit and chose to do a soft install using the window mount. With the booster in place, I can now get that same 2 bars at about -85db in my office. It only functions for about 10 ft or less from the desktop booster, and the tuning is a bit finnicky, but I am able to maintain service while near the booster. From there, I'm using my phone as a Hotspot for my laptop. I've noticed, however, that the 3G service I'm getting indoors encounters a lot more packet loss than what I get outside. So yes, the signal is just as strong, but it makes for a mediocre Internet experience. Speeds I get range from 50-300kbps with ping times between 150 to 3000.

There you have it.  This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes.  I'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them.  Also you can do this (and I strongly suggest you do) to a set that has not cracked yet, because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do.  Just do it exactly in the middle of the band.
2417	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I must say I am very pleased, the headset is very small along with the volume being good as well. The clearity is good and you can even put it in your top pocket until your phone ring and it won't bother your at all. Surprisingly I have no problems with the headset staying in my ear. The one negative thing that I would say about this product is outside it picks up all the wind, but if it's not a windy day it's no problem but I think the pros far exceed the cons.
I have this Voyager 510 paired with both my Treo 650 and Skype on my laptop (using the Anycom USB 250 I reviewed previously) The headset picks up the call from whoever rings first every time. I love it!! Skype call comes in, and the headset rings - call comes in on the Treo 650 and the headset rings. What's not to like???
1013	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Totally a scam.  Never worked  and I should have known better, don't waste your time just get a better phone or service

4156	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	the charger "stuck" to the unit and I had to almost pry it off.  Then the housing on the earpiece came off.  The company basically told me to fly a kite.  No wonder the price has consistently gone down down down.  Apparently the company is having a hard time unloading these.  I'd never do business with this lousy company again
Functionality is where this unit takes a hit. While the 200, and nearly every other headset out there, use a single button press for accessing voice dialing, the 410 uses that press for redial; the 200 used a 2-second long press for redial, where the 410 uses that for voice dial. However, it's not that difficult to get used to, and it makes an audible sound when it's redialing so a second tap can hang that up quickly. Like the 200, the 410 doesn't play your ringtones, instead it has its own simple tones for incoming call and text message.
Even with the drawbacks, suffice it to say this has been in constant use on my desk for well over a year, and it's not going away anytime soon. I would recommend this hub to anyone.
I really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.
Because of the Marantz I at least had an expectation of what I hoped the addition of the Schiit equipment would have on my computer listening habits. (FYI: I'm using iTunes with ALAC encoded tracks)  My thinking was that there was a clear difference in sound quality when I listened with my HD600's on the Marantz CD6005 vs. listening straight from the headphone jack on the back of my iMac.  Even with ALAC files the sound in my HD600's was thinner everywhere, and spatial separation and location of instruments was muddied compared to CDs played in the Marantz.

When I bought the phone it came with the USB cable I mentioned earlier, as well as a stereo hands-free headset with a detachable mic, and, joy of joys, a 1 gigabyte memory card! That's a really nice thing to have! I've got quite a bit of music on mine and it isn't even close to being filled. Tiny card, too. About the size of a fingernail.
6099	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've had the pleasure of using this products for a view days now, and I really enjoy using this.
6172	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a solid unit, compact, sleek. It charges with a  micro-usb plug common to most non-IOS devices these days (rather than the older larger mini-USB). Oddly, it features a 1-LED flashlight and a laser pointer as well. I suppose these could come in handy while camping or something, but since all 3 functions are operated by the same single push button it can be tricky to activate the charging rather than the laser or the light (which is activated depends on how long you press the "on" button). I'd prefer a separate switch for the laser/LED lamp.
2. Ear bud coated with very hard rubber; not the most gentle on your ear canal

IMP52D is a great back-up power source for my IPhone. I also need the short USB lighting cable but it is no problem. Great design, integrated flashlight and laser pointer big pluses.
9. Once paired, both headset and phone remained paired in future use, all one has to do is open the boom mike and automagically the link is made. (assuming the phone has BlueTooth turned on).
Avoid this manufacturer
I am happy with the adapter, I can get more out of my iphone.

I have since used it a few times, and find it quite effective. One set of AA's was able to add at least a few hours to the Touch's video time, and I have not yet had the occasion to require changing batteries (though I always carry an extra pair just in case). I can recommend this unit.

I like that it is very easy to change ringers, from silent to normal to vibrate.  The camera is just ok, but I don't really count on my phone to serve as my photographic equipment.
Cons: Sometimes volume could be louder in noisy environments, easy to lose the foam mic cover. buttons are hard to press (on/off) but not too bad.


For a total of [...] bucks plus shipping, I'm willing to be a little careful!  :)

1600	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I finally purchased a bluetooth phone (Samsung A900) and was pleased to find that the headset was easy to connect and works better than expected. Now I don't have to be jealous of other nerds who walk around with things sticking out of their ears.
Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a "US" vs. "International" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.

My only dislike is that they bounce around if you run with them. In winter (now) I tuck them under my jacket, but in summer they bounce and are annoying, but still usable. In summer I use 2 large safety pins to secure the ends to my shirt to keep them from moving around on my neck.

The bad:


7583	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Other reviewers were for and against this pouch. I was hoping to have better luck than most but that was not the case. After 10 days of wear it started to separate and droop where the vertical belt clip is attached. I am able to get by for now because of the way the pouch is made...using scissors I cut the metal belt clip section off and now wear it horizontally on my belt. Horizontally takes up a lot of room on your hip, but I will get by until someone makes a better vertical pouch for Samsung Galaxy S4 and hopefully one with a magnetic flap closure rather than the noisy Velcro type.

First, the good.  The sound from this headset rocks!  The noise mitigating technology is great.  I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates.  The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.

-*Can't use own music (on SD card) as ringtones,
I was hopeful when I saw that I could rate each song as it was playing, but this feature is useless. I played two hours worth of songs and rated each of them. The ratings are available on the phone, but I can't transfer the ratings back to my mp3 library with any of the three mp3 transfer mechanisms - Windows Media Player, the included Multimedia Manager (which has a column for displaying the rating but apparently no way to set it), or the mass storage USB setting using File Manager copy.
3298	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased 3 phones for my family... a V3xx, a Nokia 6126 and this KRZR for myself. It was the only one that was DOA right out of the box. Okay, not a big deal, one defective unit. I sent it back and received another one. This one worked great... or so I thought. But a week after having it my wife called on my land line and said she was calling and calling but I wasn't picking up my cell. I checked, and it had no indication of any calls. I tried calling out and it wouldn't dial. It was frozen... sort of. So I thought, maybe it needed a reset. I powered down, powered up, and it worked fine the rest of the day. Okay, it was a fluke. But then it did the same thing the next day, then the next. It sure is a beautiful and compact phone and I'm going to miss that, but I'm dumping it because I need a phone that works ALL the time, not just part of it. Sorry Motorola, I've been a loyal customer, but you blew it with this phone.
This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn't buy another one.
As phones go, it is good enough. Other reviews complain about durability and battery life. So far mine is not broken, and I agree that the battery life is short. That will put me in the habit of leaving it connected to the computer overnight to recharge (using a USB cable). It's nice to be able to charge it from USB rather than carry an AC charger when traveling. Indoor use is better than my previous phone (Sony Ericsson T610), which did not work well in my home.

2641	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was concerned after ordering this device, when I read many reviews that said this device was a cheap piece of plastic that didn't fit into their ear properly. When I opened the packaged and first put it in my ear, I thought "oh no - they were right!"

4220	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	So far I've had this Jawbone for 5 months. I work in a factory where noise is a mayor factor. I had one of my co-workers call me from the company shop to see if they could hear any noise going thru the phonecall, he was so impressed, the next day he bought a pair.

1579	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I like the product, it works very well. The only thing that is a discouraging factor with this  product is I have small ears and it is very uncomfortable for me to wear. I have a motorola bluetooth and it is much better.  Other than that it works very  well.

As per my major purchases I will list the positives and negatives of this device
8995	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Gt the product for free, basically purchased the larger charger and received this guy as a free gift. Well, it's junk. Device doesn't charge. When plugged in the charge lights come up for a few seconds indicating its charging than the unit shuts down. Like many other posters, mine probably is defective. Anyhow, my advice is to avoid.

I LOVE this holder!
2. Should come with the ability to charge using the USB Cable (Hope Nokia fixes their darn old habit of not allowing the phone to charge via the USB cable.
3.  Design is almost perfect
I docked the unit a star because I find there is little adjustment in the volume level but, having pushed it to the max, I can hear fine on the highway-- with the windows closed and AC or heat on. Also, sometimes it picks up hands free but sometimes I have to manually press the green connect button on the unit. None-the-less I am very satisfied with the product.
1650	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have used a number of Bluetooth Headsets, and I've been very impressed with the versatility, function and voice quality of this device.
The We Boost unit is slightly larger than the old sleek, but most of the phones people use today have gotten really big, so it would have been smart to make the cradle even larger than it is. And I do have a much bigger complaint, as well as a suggestion for the manufacturer. On the next generation of cradle, make the bottom pegs adjustable in length to accommodate tall smartphones. I had to cut them off so I could slide the phone down where the internal antenna would be in the right place. I only got a slight improvement in signal until I moved the phone down so that the top of the phone was even with the top of the cradle. I now get a nice boost, but it forced me to make my own bottom piece to rest the bottom of the phone on, and to keep it from sliding out. A piece of sheet metal bent at an angle, trimmed in the center for access to the charger port, did the trick. I had to tape it to the cradle to avoid drilling and putting screws into the plastic. Adjustable/extendable arms on the bottom would have made such modification unnecessary. The phone now sits close to an inch lower than it did before trimming off the pegs. After reading many of the questions and comments for this product, and also several reviews where the reviewers said theirs did not work, I'm convinced that had they been able to move the phone lower in the cradle, they likely would have seen the signal gain they were hoping for. Please fix this guys!!
4482	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is possibly the best bluetooth I have ever owned. It can function as a standalone headset while still playing wireless audio or you can add the attachment for wireless stereo music. It comes with multiple ear attachments to fit different exterior ear shapes and interior ear sizes. Very durable which is what really amazes me. I inadvertantly dropped this thing in the middle of a snow storm at my home and thought, "Oh, crap. I just lost $80." I waited a moth later and I found the head set after the snow melted. I charged it, used it, and it worked just like new! I was amazed at this little things hardiness considering it also takes daily beatings from my 1 and 3 year old.
5677	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this product is the best. definitely a 5 star because works well and is very easy to use. excellent product as well as the price
The phone is ok for basic phone features. With the exhorbitant price of data plans, if you're going to pay that much monthly, you should invest in a phone that can make better use of the data features. The crippling problems in the MP3 player render it nearly unusable for that purpose.
1967	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Was a perfect match, price was great. Used in a home system and is still going strong!! You cannot go wrong!

2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.
8108	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	UPDATE: i was able to connect this device only to the Sony ericcson phone and this device has failed to connect to any other phone after that. I have tried multiple brands of phones like Nokia, LG etc but none of them seem to connect to this device even though the phones seem to support this device. So, this was a complete waste of my money. I have not used this device in 2 years because of this issue. Infact i have a similar problem with my other Jabra Bluetooth headset. It connected to my Nokia E71 and refuses to connect to any other device!
the headphones is comfortable and firm (earpieces may be kinda tight)
highly recommend this.
- On the upper right hand side near the LED the casing seems to be loose.
agreed about bad for music, plan to use it for skype away from home but haven't tested the quality of the mic.

5959	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great size for the size of battery you get. Charges devices fast. Very convenient to toss in a bag in case you are somewhere that you can plug in to charge. Would definitely recommend.
The phone arrived much faster than I expected (especially given the awful weather we have been having in the USA). It is a more compact model than I expected, which is nice.
(But I like that one too)
1081	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Its a nice phone. I have had a 7230 for years and thought that this would be a nicer screen etc. But, the screen quality was the same, so it is quite a small upgrade really.

After a disappointing experience with the Nokia 6126, I was a bit hesitant to buy another Nokia but with this phone, Nokia has definitely redeemed themselves in my eyes!

9847	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Many people would want to avoid this product for fear of cheap quality related to the price.  This would be a mistake.  The film feels very a little thin at first but offers very good protection for the price.  I would not recomend testing the protection by dragging your keys across the screen, but it fairs well in the pocket.  Another pleasant surprise was the ease of installation.  The procust came with a lint cloth which removed any trace of lint and dust from the screen.  I have had screen protectors in the past where it was impossible to remove all the bubbles, but this one applied with minimal bubbles to begin with and they smoothed away easily.  I can say this is one of the best protectors I have purchased
6207	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I was really, really frustrated with my phone and Bluetooth earpieces dying on me with no access to a power source. Found the iTorch and it has saved me! Pros: it's very lightweight and fits in the palm of my hand. The charger cord is a retractable so I can stick it in my purse and it doesn't get wrapped around or start dragging. The cool thing about the cord is that you use it recharge the iTorch and then flip it and use the same cord to charge the phone/Bluetooth. It can charge a cell phone and a Bluetooth completely with one charge. Cons: it comes with 2 charger tips, which are about 1" x " and can easily be lost. It would be cool if there were a little storage drawer at the bottom of the device for the tips. It has a superfluous laser pointer, which I have not found a use for. Also, you can't just plug it in and assume your phone is charging - you have to click the button to start the charge. Strike that - you have to click AND HOLD the button to start the charge. If you just click it, the laser pointer will turn on, not the charger, and your co-workers will freak out because they don't know where that red light is coming from. Bottom line: Love it, love it, love it. It's small, easy to use (once you get that click-and-hold habit), and does its job. Highly recommended!

* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to "geotag" pictures with your location as you use the camera).
While there is not much obvious difference (other than price) between replacement AC chargers, the iGo AC adapter/charger for mobile electronics, the iGO has unique flexibility that make it worth considering over others:
Highly visible outside screen (even in bright sunlight)
8881	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Like having an outlet in your pocket wherever you go!  Very handy.  High quality product, I've used it dozens of times/charges now and it's still going strong....

5207	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Just as advertised... Easy to use and intuitive. I had it up and running in five minutes. I use this to listen to my MP3s on my Nokia cell phone(3555b). I turn it on and it automatically cues my phone's music player and starts playing without me having to touch the phone. When I get a call it is very nice to be able to talk using the built in Mic and the ear buds block all background noise allowing good conversation. Music automatically resumes when I hang up.
Originally, I have got it for my Nokia Xpress Music 5310, with which - surprisingly! - the device was incompatible even though the model is specifically listed as a compatible one. Mine said "device is not supported" - bummer! But, interestingly enough, I have switched to a different provide' and got Blackberry Bold - which perfectly recognizes the hands free - so, I am happy.
2786	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Thanks! "There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love." 1 John 4:18

3972	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	If you are looking for an inexpensive but effective way of hands-free communication with your bluetooth-enabled cellphone, I highly recommend this product. It is easy to set up with your phone and works reasonably well and is attractively priced. Voice quality is very good and battery life is exceptional. I don't do much talking on my cellphone so that might add to the time between charges, but I easily get a month on a charge leaving it on 24/7. If I turn it off over night (if I remember to do so!), I can go about 2 months between charges. And the little blue flashing light to let you know it's alive is most unintrusive.

I purchased my Moto Q (Q9H) online and received it in 2 days right before Thanksgiving and had the chance to use it in Europe (voice and data) with no issues recently.  I live in the Dallas Texas area and have had no issues in this area, nor most of the major cities in Texas I've been to, plus the driving duration.
  The description says it can be used to charge the iPad 2, so that was the first thing I tried it on. For not being specifically designed to charge something with a ten hour battery life, it did amazingly well. The iTorch adds another five hours screen time to the iPad 2.
I decided to give the Jabra a real-world torture-test right out of the box. We recently purchased a new smart fortwo -- the European micro-car that has just gone on the market in the USA. It is definitely much louder inside than our other cars, as the engine is directly behind the driver's seat and these cars have very little sound-deadening material.
3. Call quality is good and clear, no issues with volume.

4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.

Now for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't "see" any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better. Caveat emptor!
2737	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this is one of the best cases I have ever had for any device.  It fits perfectly and came 100% as advertised.  No build disappointments or surprises.  Love the clear/frosted back as it lets the ceramic white show throw.  This case looks/sits like its OEM.  All the ports and buttons are accessible.  Didn't add hardly any bulk to the phone.  My only even sort of complaint is that the buttons are covered instead of cutout and require more effort to push.  That being said, it can be considered an asset too because it prevents pocket button pushing.
It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode.
Note: it needs to charge overnight for best results. Love it!

364	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Quick charger, got it for someone else. Their old HTC charger would not charge quicker than the phone discharged and this one does. Also came with laffy taffy. Banana flavored, mind you.

The battery life is good for a product of this size. It charges my devices quickly, and the device itself does not take too long to charge.
Kensington has worked around this with their universal holder (works for iPods and iPhones also)...you hit the button on the back, and the arms of the holder slide out so you can position your iPod/Zune/what have you, and then you just pinch the arms closed around your device.  The holder is padded, so it securely and safely holds your device.  The suction cup is the best of any device of it's type (MUCH better than Griffin's WindowSeat).  It has a nice, long gooseneck which allows for a multitude of mounting places; the holder can swivel to landscape mode as well (for watching movies, videos, etc).
CNETs review of the speaker phone is accurate:
The ear buds themselves seem to make this product for me.  If you do not like bud earphones you will hate this product.  Being a big fan of bud earphones I find that these lock out even more noise than normal.  (They passed the spouse/kids test)  This was a bonus when I cut the grass.  I didn't have to raise the volume very much to hear my music and block the sound of the mower.
Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter "A" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.
3: wait about 20 seconds.
I am pleased to testify that this 9-cell will outlive my T60. It's almost as good in January 2010 as it was in November 2008 when this review was written - still giving me about 2.5 hours when fully charged. In fact, as I am upgrading from a T60 to a T400, I am keeping this 9-cell as a backup/extra battery for my new laptop.
8234	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	My old Nokia 6101, which is almost three years old, has served me well and still works like a champ.  The only reason I even considered getting a new phone was because I wanted Bluetooth.  The 6263 seemed like the ideal replacement for my trusty 6101.


9661	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good buy.
The thing I hated about this headset was the soft touch button on the headset. When you walk around with the headset in your pocket, the soft button will get pushed automatically and you'll be making prank calls (by redialing the previous number) without your knowledge.  After a few such prank calls, this one ended in the trash.

recommended accessories: music essentials kit, bluetooth headset (though i wish i got the bluetooth ear buds instead of the headset, since you cant listen to music on the headset), microsd card, and the only cases ive found that don't hinder looks or functionality are the snap on hard plastic ones, they're less than 20 bucks and come in lots of nice colors and designs.
8644	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great screen protector.  You get one for the inside and outside screen but I prefer to just use both for the outside since there is little risk to hurting the inside screen.  One one goes I'll have a back up.  Can't beat it for the price.
5410	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The idea was great but it is junk it does not charge and does not retract once you pull it out-don't buy it you'll waste your money!
1636	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone.  People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and cannot tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone.  That was not the case with the first one. I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods.  My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on.  The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing.  I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket.
I find that I often have to turn the volume down on the headset because it's just too loud even while driving with the windows down. People I talk to have said that they don't even notice that I'm using a headset which is important to me. I hate when people use headsets that make them sound far away or like they're standing in a silo. One time I was standing outside and it was getting ready to storm and the wind was blowing like crazy. My friend did say he couldn't hear me well with the wind blowing that hard into the microphone. Makes sense.

8905	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have purchased the iTorch and I LOVE it.. it works perfect and it is small and compact, comes with a nice carrying pouch.  Universal so I can use with my I4 and I5 phones.  Love the light, that really helps at night when coming home late. So far nothing I don't like
7152	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product and perfect price.
Usage - The iTorch works as advertised but this is where my only issue comes in. To keep the device simple and elegant I understand the reason behind only placing one button but you are essentially controlling 3 functions with this device. (Charging, Laser Pointer and LED Light) A single tap of the button lights turns on the device for charging and shows the amount of charge by the number of lit LED's 1-4. After about 15 seconds the unit powers down automatically. To use the LED Laser Pointer you double tap the function button. Once to turn on the device and again to turn on the red laser. Another tap will turn the laser pointer back off and then the unit will power down itself. In order to use the White LED flashlight you need to hold the function button for 3-4 seconds while the unit is in its powered down state and to turn the flashlight off again you need to repeat the 3-4 seconds. Not a deal breaker by any means but possibly one additional function button to control the lights or change the single button to work with taps (1 Tap Power, 2 Taps Laser 3 Taps Flashlight) This would be a faster way to turn the unit on and off as needed.
448	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	As long as there are products like this available to hold the portable GPS units I would never pay the price for a built in GPS on a car as an accessory. Fits anywhere,stays in place.
6726	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	What ca you say about batteries? These work as expected. I bought them to replace the dead batteries in a couple of watches and they work fine. I recommend the batteries and the vendor.


8/1/08:  Two more things: I downloaded Opera Mini and it is far superior and faster then the built-in web browser.  Secondly, you can take the phone off the cell network and just use Wi-Fi, which is great when I am home because the cell signal is weak in my house.
1. Charger connection is micro-USB. You either have to carry another charger (the one supplied), or get an adapter cable from Mini-USB > Micro-USB in order to use your existing charger.

3012	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Functionally, as good as any other blackberry holster. However, my perception is that it is "cheap plastic looking" because it is shiny. It has a sheen that may need a little sandpaper taken to it.


The only instructions are on the back of the box - just 3 steps. Personally, I would have appreciated a little more in the way of set-up and troubleshooting instructions, hence my 4 star rating.

Best of all, it is a great PHONE.


8573	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This headset was very statiky and did not work well.  I ended up returning it.  I purchased a few on-line which did not work at all.  I would stronly reccomend buying a product like this from a brick-and-morter store.  It might save you a lot of hassle.

Just incase you're not entirely sure what this does...  In some vehicles (I'm not sure exactly which ones so you'll have to do your own research), the factory installed radios control various other functions such as the chimes.  In my 2004 Envoy, the radio also stays on after you turn off the truck until you open a door.  This feature and the chimes are lost if you remove the factory radio without using the GMOS-01 adapter.

9093	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The IMP52D battery is about the size of a small cell phone. When you take it out of the package, you see only a nice cloth bag for storage, a micro USB charging cable for Android smart phones and a USB cable about 6" long used as an adaptor for charging a Samsung Galaxy Tab and a small instruction book.
I usually only purchase items online or in the store if I am able to get real reviews from Amazon.com
6369	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	First of all, it is great value that I got two of them - the previous one I got broke on the belt clip part, so I think I will get two of them just in case that happen again. It fit OK with the MyTouch4G phone - just a little tight.
So that is how it performed for me and here are my pros and cons:
363	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I was measuring about 0.6%/min with the original charger and about 0.8%/min with this one. I'm inclined to knock a star off because after just a week of use my charging port stopped working. Upon closer inspection it looked as though the pins were damaged. Considering how tight/snug the micro-usb sold with this charger fits, I am pretty certain this is the reason the pins got damaged.

7417	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have 7 or 8 Pelican Micro cases already and love them.  This case for my ipod touch is a nice addition, but it needs a little tweaking in the details.  First, the storage for the earphones is awkward.  Having to remove the ipod from the case to get at the earphones (they coil up beneath the unit around a central rubber "core") is not only awkward but also somewhat defeats the purpose of having it in a protective case.  It also doesn't hold onto the ipod well.  When closed, the ipod is held quite firmly, but when opened, the little rubber "fingers" do not grip it tightly enough to prevent it from falling out if tipped upside down.  The cord which plugs into the earphone jack to allow you to plug in your ear buds from the outside does in fact allow the use of the microphone on your earbuds so that is a nice feature.  All in all, a nice protective case, but I have to carry my earbuds externally to avoid the juggling act required to carry them "in case".  One more thing, be sure to apply one of those clear protective films to the outside of the "viewing panel" molded into the case or it will quickly become hazed with scratches.
Everything about this headset is great, except everyone wishes it wasn't so bulky. But I found a way to not have to use the ear hook by using one of the multiple earpiece inserts it comes with such that it stays very, very securely in my ear.

Pros:

Update- I dropped it in the parking lot, someone ran over it.  Apparently military durability does not include the ability to withstand crushing forces.

I'm not sure why this phone isn't much more popular. I feel so much more at ease now that she has it, with a firm understand that it is for emergencies only!  *So much so that when I was calling her, she told her sitter she wasn't going to answer since it's only for emergencies. lol
the screen is nice, but since this is small, that I have hard time tapping with fingernails
I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.  I'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you won't find a better BT headset for the 650.

It actually out lasted to sets of headphones. lol

7729	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this product with high hopes and high expectations. After a few weeks, it started having alot of static, battery life was terrible, and the range was terrible. I am trying to return this product right now. I am very dissapointed.

One of the best options (I know several phones don't have)-I turn off my phone for the night, but alarm still wakes me up, and Nokia asks for snooze or for switching to phone on mode. Awesome-it saves battery and no text or phone calls can wake me up).

9224	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I was initially disappointed that the case did not have an actual belt loop, since in the past, these things would managed to fall off the belt when I got out of a car, or carried bulky items on my left, etc.
Save on Connector Wear and Hassle by Going Wireless
OTHER OPTIONS - WINDOWS MOBILE OR APPLE OR PALM: No other operating system offers as many downloadable apps as the Symbian systems. This means you can download Symella and download music, video and files to your phone like LIMEWIRE. You can download Handwave and direct your phone w/o even touching it. You can download Nokmote, Rockandscroll or Rotateme and direct the N82 by motion. There are countless more free apps available. It's just more expandable than any other operating system.
On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on "write on screen" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.
I would of gave it 5 stars but I want to use the holster function.
bottom line, this device works well and the audio quality is fine.
I am not as impressed with the 3rd generation as I was with the first generation. This phone is a lot slower than my old, and lags quite a bit. I also cannot connect it to my Linux laptops like I could with my other. I believe it's because the phone mounts the disk, and it cannot be unmounted. This is probably my biggest problem with this phone. I could do this with the first phone. I have had times when the phone does stupid things like shut itself off. At first I was worried, but the alarm will ring even if the phone is off, so I have reliably used it as an alarm clock when I am on the road.
4710	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I own a much more expensive Tumi version. This one is not only 1/3 of the price, but it also works almost as well. The main drawback is that prongs tends to get stuck while moving back and forth. It will take some hand dexterity to move them.
And I received it short enough in time.

2 powertips are included (ipod and micro-USB) ... I prefer just to use the normal USB cable supplied with whatever device I'm charging. Note that on occasion when charging my Blackberry the unit produces a "Device can't charge
Cons: the battery strength indicator light system can be confusing at first. Also, it's very easy to accidentally push the laser button (not that the cats mind!) or the flashlight button.

It's not just the flash. It's not just the 5 megapixels. It's not just the lens cover. It's a lens that can handle the megapixels and an autofocus that makes it worth while. Most of us aren't trying to take poster-sized photos. For best results, I reduce the initial size of the photo (to 5x7 or so) so it doesn't have to be edited down.

It was returned. Not recommended.


5187	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The case is cumbersome and you cannot dock the phone without removing the case, which is difficult because it is in three peices.  Customer service is a joke.
7127	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This battery was for an older LG phone. It was the same battery as the original and a LG brand. Works well with phone and the phone works like new. The battery arrived about four days earlier than estimated arrival date. My origianl battery can no longer hold a charge. This battery resolved the problem.
Aside from being good-looking, the handset is functional. It's got a lot of useful features, and none of the complicated and superfluous bells and whistles of the Windows Mobile of Symbian smartphones (the VIEWTY isn't classified as a smartphone). It's got a 3 inch touch screen, so you can use a finger to navigate (LG includes a stylus that looks like a mascara tube, the stylus pops out when you pull off the cap) so you don't need a stylus. There's a multimedia player that handles several file formats, organizer, calender, planners, a virtual (landscape oriented) QWERTY keypad, T9 keypad, predictive text input, handwriting recognition, and photo/video editing utilities.
7452	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really like these headsets and am thrilled I can still get them at least online.

I make most of my phone calls on my commute to and from work, and being on the road for up to 2-3 hours a day (and living in a HANDS FREE only state) with out a BT (blue tooth) headset I can't make any calls.  I have been using Etymotic products for the past 3 years (ER*4P, ER*6i & their ear plugs), and can't get enough of them.  This BT headset continues the trend.  Driving in my car with my windows down, music at a relatively loud volume, and traveling around 65, I was able to use the voice operated commands to place a call, and when my caller picked up, they commented on how clear the conversation was...they were convinced I was locked away in padded room!  Not only were they able to hear me, but with the noise isolation earphone (my preference is the foam insert) I was able to hear them crystal clear while having all of the ambient noise around me at a relatively high dB level.

Great operation with my wife's and my iPhones as well as my Moto Razr phone.  Pairing is a piece of cake and the feature of the phone re-pairing after being turned on works flawlessly.  The battery saving feature where it shuts off automatically also works great.
Inbound sound quality: B-, volume is improved and adequate, but could be a bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but lack bass. Minimal static.
3. The face is too flashy for my taste.  I wish it had a more matted finish.

6598	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	After careful research I ordered this product only to find it wasn't all I expected.  Our reception is marginal and there is one place in the house where I can make calls, the signal is usually about -102 at this location.  I connected the device and mounted the antenna on the roof where the signal is about -95.  everything seemed to be connected properly and my phone signal actually read as low as -59 with the transmitter touching the phone.  I called customer service several times for help.  They told me that my signal was not strong enough to make the unit work, but if i wanted to trade it in for a more expensive model this might work. This made no sense to me as I could make calls direct from a weaker signal of -102, but the amplifyer won't let me make calls with a signal of -95? I felt they gave me the run-around just so they could sell a more expensive model.

Cons:

Sprint coverage is better than advertised as long as you use a good phone. Customer service is not as great as it used to be, but it's still better than Verizon.  I'm switching friends off of Verizon to Sprint. Believe me, if you have bad reception, you have a bad phone and it's time to use that warrantee. With this phone, I've had to go back to the Sprint store countless times to get them to swap it out.

3) The clip on the dog tag does not work at all. I never got it to stay clipped on anything for more than a few minutes. It's really annoying, because the chain isn't really the ideal solution for running either, unless you enjoy something constantly banging you in the chest.

I really like this headset.  I just wish that Jabra had engineered the shape and the earhook a little better.

1907	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I just got this headset from Best Buy. I paid a little extra there because of the counterfeit scare in the online world! However, I just love the sound. Specially the bass. Most of the ear-bud style headphones suck at reproducing bass. My T-Mobile MDA has paired up perfectly. The A2DP and the volume/play/pause/mute work like charm. I would give it a 5 star but it's a little bulky for the gym. The cloth interior of the speakers will not stand the sweat for long. The shocks at the treadmill are yet to be tried out.
At this point, if it works as well as Wilson products have for me in the past, I pretty sure I won't be disappointed. At $200 it may seem a bit pricey, but for a business person, farmer, or builder (etc.) who depends on cell phone connectivity I think it's not too steep a price to pay.

4.  Antenna: Considering the fact that this phone is heavy and bulky the MOT guys could have shown some mercy on the size of the antenna. It could have been more like the antenna you would find on a T722i.

5437	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought the Nokia N82 for the 5MP camera, the full motion 30fps video and the symbian OS. It replaced a SE K790a. The above mentioned features work well and I've never been able to fill my installed 8GB SD micro SDHC card. Initially I was concerned when it turns out some of my favorite programming is transmitted over the internet using the Microsoft WMA format which symbian doesn't support, however, I was able to work around this using my home Sling Player AV and installing Sling Player Mobile on my Nokia N82. Now through T-Mobile internet I listen to and watch a variety of cable programming worldwide which is coming off my home's Verizon FIOS box. I also get Shoutcast internet audio programming directly off internet websites through T-Mobile internet and this, of course, works flawlessly and most efficiently. It would be nice if more internet broadcasters adopted this format. Overall its hard to beat this phone. Battery life is very good considering how I use the phone and it recharges quickly.

COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:
6390	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The case is a little cumbersome to put on, and some dust and junk gets stuck around the holes. The case is lined with soft material, and is rubbery on the outside, a rubbery coating on a hard plastic inside. It protects the phone well, although it can pop off if dropped (the energy goes to popping it off, the phone comes out unscathed). It comes with a belt clip, although with its popping off ability, I'm skeptical of that.
4187	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The Jawbone rocks when it comes to clarity, functionality and weight.  The only issue I have is the ear piece doesn't fit exceptionally well and I've broke (by bending) the wire piece that goes over the ear.  Even with these little problems, I still love this headset.
I forgot to add the laser pointer and LED light, they have come into play several times, a great addition to the perfect product.

6817	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	After several weeks my watch is still going so I guess these are OK
All in all, it's a good choice for a modern slider phone, but has some limitations.
2183	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I have the Motorola Nextel i880 and the data cable would not fit. I returned this item immediately.
3052	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Does a good job with high quality paper towels. like Kimberly-Clark Kleenex 01890 1-Ply Multi-Fold Towel, 9-25/64" that I ordered from Amazon.
- Kinda plasticky feeling
4543	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I've had a great deal of trouble finding an adequate handsfree device to comply with the new laws in CA regarding cell phone use while driving.  With some (such as the Motorola H700), the mic would be right up against my chubby cheeks and people couldn't hear me, and with the speaker just resting outside of the ear, I often couldn't hear them either.  With others, such as the Jabra that clips to your car's visor, the road noise on the freeway made it impossible to hear the other person, or for them to hear you.  The Plantronics 220 has been a nice change...  It actually fits my ear and face, and I can hear and be heard with no trouble.  I can lean forward without it falling off/out of my ear.  The unit does get a little staticky at times, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  My husband and I both have this one now, and it's definitely the best bang-for-your-buck headset we've tried yet.
3d games are great, this cell has an 3d chip, even quake has opengl acceleration, but there are few games that use this
+ Excellent Camera 5mp w/xenon Flash!!!
In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.  If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone.  If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.
3945	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	After much research I bought this headset when my wired headset wore out. The sound quality is adequate. I use it in the car when driving so sound is a priority for me. People I called said they could hear me well and there wasn't too much background noise. On my end, however, their voices usually sounded very tinny and echo-y.
Unfortunately these criticisms apply to all phones. Sanyo has added some nice features to this model. Even with its flaws, it's a decent deal for the price. If you can afford the next generation, however, I would recommend it.  Best wishes!

The device comes with a USB cord so you can plug it into your favorite USB wall socket, your cars USB or your computer.  The cord winds up to become compact when not in use.

2153	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This case is mega study. I bought this because I go kayaking with my dad.
The 1 amp nature of the device limits its charging focus to single
If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is "connected" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant "crackling" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just "disconnect" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)
7602	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got these for overseas and it does a great job.  This is compact, easy to use and well worth the price!
(+) Cheap
881	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	So far 5 star's
1314	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone, the ear bud is too big, uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear. After two weeks of use, the on/off switch stopped working, and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit. In sum, it was a waste of money. There was no provision in this review for "0" stars, so I gave it "1"

6341	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	When my dad decided he wanted a smartphone, we were really concerned about protecting it because he works in a hot factory where he welds and runs machinery all day and has mangled and melted parts of a few cheap flip phones.  He also sent one through the lawnmower blades when it fell out of his pocket.  So after ordering his first smartphone, mom and i decided to get this for him as well as a heavy duty case and a screen protector.  He has the samsung exhilirate phone with a bulky ballistic case and a regular screen protector...so far his phone has been well protected for 8 months in this along with the case and screen protector.  Alas, the clip on the back of this belt holster finally ripped away from the fabric and he has it super glued on for now (which is working).  He wants a new one though, so I'm getting him a second one.  He's really really rough on everything when he's working so this should hold up for a while under rough conditions and for much longer under normal circumstances.  It's also roomy and fits his bulky case.
My friends are now going to buy this for themselves.
Quick update.  Perhaps an unforeseen problem is that accessories such as cases, screen protectors, and such have been slow to come along in the market(Should have know this buying a product on release.  You'd figure for $750 they'd give you a screen protector and maybe a microfiber bag).  In addition, not all N95 software works with the N95 8gb.  Both of these issues are very minor and will not be a problem for long.
1240	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Product did not work. Will not pair with phone. When it does it drops ur call. Over and over like the fit snooges your ear.
6035 can select one or all calls in the call history log to delete or mange the logs
They are indeed tiny, but they need to be to get the thread through the eye of the needle that SanDisk forces us to thread. So I attach a loop or key chain to the other end. Can't beat the price either. Delivery is slow--they come from Hong Kong. But I'm amazed they can even ship them for what I pay for them, so no complaints there.
Now for some details. The Jawbone is by far the best for handling noise cancellation. However, the voice would sometimes be garbled or breakup. The Z9 does a good job on noise cancellation and the voice stays clear and does not breakup.
1) Required "special" cables to charge devices at full AC speeds.

Hope this helps.
2975	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	(Yes, that's wordplay on a Prince song.) I hate headsets because I've never found one that really truly works for me. Sure, I can hear through them and I can speak and others hear me but it's they're not problem-free by any stretch of the imagination. But, I keep searching.

This is a good idea that was implemented poorly.

In constructing a portable station that is 12 volt battery powered, I added two of these to the power panel on the front of the rack that holds my equipment. One is used at night with an LED map light on a gooseneck and the other is available for charging phones or running other 12 volt equipment that is powered through a cigarette lighter plug.
8588	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My daughter recently received a Blackberry Pearl 8100 as a hand me down from a family member.  Unfortunately we realized immediately that it would not take a charge from the standard side usb plug, so this was our solution. We received it quickly, plugged it in, docked the phone and it charged wonderfully. My daughter doesn't seem to care about the light that stays on, as she is just happy to have her phone charging.
6115	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really like my Trent, it works great , the only thing is that the button ON/OFF doesn't work sometimes, but other than that, it is a great device, just do not work for Ipad.
The new unit functioned for about two weeks and then went bad just like the first unit.  Again, their customer service folks were very nice and are setting up another RMA replacement.  This time I insisted that I should not have to pay shipping for shipping my unit back to them and they agreed.  I don't have much confidence that the third unit will last very long, either.  I'm keeping track of my warranty claims, from the time I make the claim to the time I receive a replacement, because the manufacturer must add that lost time back on to the warranty period.  It is illegal (at least in California) for a manufacturer to run down the consumer's warranty clock while warranty claims are pending (as long as the delay is not on the consumer's end).  The 1-year warranty is one year of usability by the consumer and not just one calendar year from purchase.


2355	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	the purchase went through dino direct via Amazon. I have had this bluetooth before and was satisfied..unfortunately these two never worked. Takes an act of God to find an english speaking cust service rep.
For some reason, the buttons won't work when I set my phone to locked keys. -- as if the Jabra keys get locked too. So I can't use the key lock on the phone, which is a bit of a bummer, but I'm just mindful of which pocket the phone goes in.


3677	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great commerce.....ordered it quick, got it quick, was just as promised..great product for cheap. This is why I shop with amazon..
9457	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	works great
1465	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a good headset; nothing flashy, nothing top-of-the-line, but a good product that does its job. It's not one of the newer A2DP headsets that do audio other than a phonecall, but if you don't need that, it's good for just phonecalls. It's a little bulky, but sturdy and fits well.
7459	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	have used like it for at the computer

2501	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	This is probably a very good product, as most Motorola products are. The one which I received however did not stay connected to the phone, and it would dial the last called number on its own. It also would beep in your ear all of the time. I sent it back and received a prompt refund, including my shipping costs.
As cool as the noise cancellation feature is, and as good as the outgoing sound is, I cannot in good conscience recommend this headset until they sort out the quality control problems. Still, I am giving it 4 stars, because when it works it works very well. Caveat emptor.

1664	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have never had a Bluetooth headset before the 510.  I use it with a Motorola i870 Nextel phone.  The headset works great, sometimes it disconnects for a moment and I just press the button on the side of the headset and it reconnects.  The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device.  The range isn't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870.  If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset.  Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge.  However, while it's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone.  It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it.  The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up.  Everyone I have spoken with on the headset says it sounds very nice and clear.
Update: 11-5-16
of the traveling and running around we did over the 3 days, it came in so
Some things not to like about the phone:
 I highly doubt their product warranty means anything to them or - or even if they will stand behind it.
I highly recommend this case as it lasts about twice as long as the other because it's almost 5000 mah and my other one is a little over 2000.  I like that these come in the same color as my phone.  It also makes my phone easier to see and on the back of the phone it has a lever that allows me to stand my phone up horizontally or vertically.  This one takes about 2 hours to fully charge I think.
  The standy by time and talk time is impressive. I have not measured it, but it far exceeds my expectations.
Over all, this is a great product and I recommend this to anyone who needs it. It's compact, it's cheap, and it does the job, aside from the minor design flaws.
Ha ha rubber if you call it that...super thin rubber.

Overall
4879	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have had the H710 Motorola Earbud for awhile now and have found it to be pretty good.  I had to replace my original that I lost at the airport (my own fault) going through security.  The replacement was fine until the little colored metal stripe on the boom came loose at the tip (small pointed end) and ended up bent back unrepairable.  So, I just pulled the strip off the earbud.  End of problem.  I was thinking though, has this happened to others?  Is this from a group of earbuds that were marked possibly defective and that is why I got it at a discount?  Anyway, it works fine without the "look good" metal strip.
9278	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good holster.  Does what it's supposed to do, hold your cell phone, but what make this so good is the price.  Again, go to Verizon and see how much this cost and you'll understand.  The shipping cost more than the holster but it's still worth the price.


the only issue i had was the belt clip broke. i replaced it with the heavy duty one and all has been well.
I almost forgot this. When my phone is in the cradle and not in use, I can keep it charge up through a USB port built into the side of the Drive 4G-S. To do this it takes a charging cable with a standard sized USB plug at one end and a micro USB plug at the other end. My phone came with one of those so I was all set.

3) sometimes things can interfere with the signal. I'm not sure what it is but certain areas where I drive there is a lot of distortion. When I leave those areas it usually clears up. If not I disconnect and reconnect to my phone and all is well again.

4790	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This charger is an overnight type of charger, something the description hinted at, but I didn't read it well enough(no fault of the charger, so no loss of stars by me). It does charge the batteries I use well, though, with the one fault being that it doesn't shut itself off after it finishes charging, which can harm your batteries if not monitored properly. There are better on Amazon for the same amount of cash, though, so do a better job than me and search for them on here.
1423	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	A very good product and I would recommend to everybody who wants to use a Bluetooth. Sound quality is good and battery time is as mentioned.

I have about 50-50 usage of the headset wearing it and leaving it closed in the pocket. I charge it every night, never had a low-battery problem in a day. Talk 2-4hrs a day on average. If in the pocket I can get it out, unflipped and talking on the phone before the call cancels (it's close though). Thought the flip close was wierd at first, but probably the best interface, wouldn't want to have to mess with a button to wakeup/connect. Connect time to cell is about 1-2 seconds after opening.
8926	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	We camp every month and it is a challenge keeping electronic devices like phones and iPads charged through the weekend. In the woods you seldom have access to a wall outlet, and the solar charger seems good just for a 75% charge on one device. Memorial weekend I took the Trent: iTorch IMP52D - (5200mAh) that I had charged the prior week. It was small and sleek and easy to pack or pocket. It charged my iPhone twice and still had 50% power come Monday morning. Small enough to fit in your hand, but not at all wimpy, it feels very solid and able to stand up to heavy use.
8624	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Bought these as a future replacement if my clip happens to get caught and break. So far, my Cellet case has proven to be very durable as is the belt clip so I may not be needing these too soon!
Cons--
I also got my wife the Mophie attachment charger for iPhone 4 and it works perfectly with this case.
I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that's because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.
UPDATE: [December, 2008] I bought a second one in May, 2008 to keep around as a spare, actually mostly to get the second charger unit to keep packed in my ready-to-go travel kit. The headset broke after its third use. The hard plastic 'outside/spine' separated from the soft rubbery 'inside/belly.' And that broke a small wire inside. I Googled around and found such complaints on the rise for this line of Jabra products (the current models in the lineage are the 2020 & 2050). So I've turned it in for warranty replacement. I politely asked for a refund, but no dice. And since this model is out of production I won't be surprised to get a refurb unit back. Ugh.  But I've also bought the well-rated Plantronics Voyager 510 to use from now on as my primary Bluetooth headset at my home desk. The two Jabra BT250v units and chargers will go to the office (where I rarely use a headset) and into the travel kit.
2) I suspect this is a problem with the phone, but when a phone call ends, I usually have to reboot the phone to continue playback through the headphones, even though the devices remain paired.
Reccomended.


This phone is all looks and no substance. If you just want a pretty phone that is very nearly useless, get this. Otherwise, avoid.

8345	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very handy product.  I keep them on hand as there seems to be an unending number of uses for them.
2525	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	It works exactly as described. Easy to instal, crystall clear, easy to clean. Just overall a great product.
  The one thing I have noticed is that while there is a stigma for wearing a bluetooth headset, even though in many states it is necessary for answering in car calls, it is even more so with the Voyager. I still get comments at work or around with friends about the device, it is a large device and you will get the "welcome to xxxxxx, can i take your order" comments. The comments don't really bother me but it is a point to be brought up.

air was being let out of a tire slowly. I'm not sure why it was doing this


First, the good.  The sound from this headset rocks!  The noise mitigating technology is great.  I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates.  The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear.  It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't.

4779	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The first phone had a defective microphone inside, however Amazon sent me a new phone next day air. Wow. I do love this phone. It is slick, functional and Nokia is my favorite phone for overall quality. This black e51 does everything good, maybe it tries to do too much. It could be a little bit louder on every phone. Headphone power is good but not my ipod. Speaker is ok, but not loud. It could use a 3.5mm headphone jack like the rest of the planet. The wifi works great, but the menu is a little confusing, and the mail section with yahoo won't let me go on wi fi. It must be just for cell companies. You can just go to the internet and go to yahoo but it takes longer. You can turn off the cell internet to prevent overcharges that's nice. Please understand I do love this phone I'm just being critical. Trust me you will baby this phone, and want it back in your hands when others look at it. Unless I'm just obsessive compulsive. Great screen clarity. The music is clear, and makes great ringtones too. It looks basic yet modern and is high quality throughout. Amazon's quick response made me a loyal fan. You will not get the same treatment from best buy or any other electronics big store.

The other device I'm able to test is the iPod Touch. I ran this down to no charge remaining and plugged in my fully recharged IMP52D. The iPod came back to full charge in 2 hours and I still had 3 lights remaining on my charger. I probably could have fully recharged my Touch a total of 3 times or more on one charge of the IMP52D.

851	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	ok. i do really love these. i switched to these after my lg tones infinums broke. i can say that it is really hard to tell the difference in audio quality both in music and in talk. about the only "complaint" i have is that they are stiff. the collar has no give at all. it is just there. (for some this might not be a problem. for me i have a thicker neck so i do notice a little.
Overall, this is truly one of the best phones I've ever used and I've been extremely happy with it.  All of my apps are installed on my 4gb microSD card and I've only had one lockup when I had the media player, Outlook email, text messages, Google Maps, Windows Live Maps, and Opera all running.  Now I specifically choose to exit each app if I know I won't need it anymore and I've been fine.

WEB EXTRA: Since I have their data plan, it allows me access at any HotSpot. So when I take my laptop to Starbucks, it connects very easily and quickly. No extra charge. My data plan with T-Mobile is $30. Compared to the Verizon plan, which is $44 and does not give you any HotSpot access, it's a deal.
I check my work email account and browse ABC news, ESPN news, and CNN news at stoplights.  It even worked way out in the country on a vacation trip in July (Lake of the Ozarks).  With my Yahoo account I set up all kinds of "alerts".  I get breaking news, weather, etc.  Your phone will have an email address of its own so your friends and family anywhere can send you email.
Unit works great and I am pleased.  Some small nitpicky things are: The power brick is kinda big, the LED is really bright, and you do not use the normal A--B USB cord to connect the hub to the PC... you use an A--MiniUSB cord. Not a big deal, but I have lots of 8ft AB cords but no long A--Mini.  The 5' cord that comes with it is too short for me. Thanks for reading.

Next, there is a plastic attachment that your mount can go on that sticks on your dashboard or wherever you want your phone so that you can mount it easily.  You don't have to use this but your phone would just be sitting there with all these wires attached to it if you didn't.

3748	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good Product
The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700. I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine, and I can hear them; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone (LG VX8300) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on.

This product will approximately charge your IPhone 4S from 10% to 60% in an hour in a half or so with only one light blinking(The charge battery of the charger is measure by lights) if the phone either has great reception or if it's in airplane mode. If the phone has one bar or two, it will charge from 75% to 90% in an hour in a half or so with one light blinking as well. But, keep in mind that your phone is wasting lots energy looking for signal, which is why it takes longer and more energy to charge.

1457	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	My friend recommended this product to me and he was right it works great. I tried so many more before I decided on this one. A Little bulky but for the clarity you get I can live with that.
My only issue with the H700 (and this has been fixed in the H710) is an extremely short range; if I left my phone in my pocked while talking on the headset, I would hear some subtle crackling; take the phone out and hold it in my hand and it was OK. While OK for "car use", I ended up returning it and getting the H710 mainly for this reason.

My only suggestion for this product is a dedicated on/off button for the battery, laser pointer and flashlight.  This current product requires you to cycle and hold the sole button to get to the function you want.  At the very least, it would save time.  This is merely a personal opinion however, and I did not feel the need to drop off a star rating over this idea.
Do AC adapters come with this thing or not?!
For 5 bucks and free shipping for prime members it was a steal!

If you are reading this review because you are shopping for a new Bluetooth headset, just go ahead and finishing reading the next couple sentences and then you can do what I did... buy the Plantronics Voyager 510 at Amazon (for under $45.00 as of this review).  I own 10 different headsets and have used them all to make hundreds of calls in all types of environments, and since we can only really rate products on a curve, there is currently no better choice at this time (things will no doubt change one day).  It is the most stable, the most ergonomic, the most static free (there is no such thing as a completely static free wireless product), the most efficient with it's battery usage, most comfortable (a somewhat subjective attribute), the most bang for the buck, the most satisfying to use, and the most 5 star rated Bluetooth Headset money can buy.  I can only really complain about one thing... a very sensitive microphone that will pick up wind noise in moderately windy conditions (in spite of the noise cancelling technology), but this is certainly true with every headset that I have used and probably true with ALL headsets when you come down to it.

But I wanted just a little more proection for the screen when I put it in a pack pocket for hiking or whatever.  I do use the case some as it is very soft and light weight.  I gave it 5 stars because it is very well made and it is what it is supposed to be.

T-Mobile users: make sure you pick PCS (1900) version, this can help your indoor reception if you have decent signal outdoors (100%), but just have problem indoors

8305	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	While it did come quickly that was it.  The first time I plugged it into my power outlet in my car the charger literally fell apart.  I plugged it in and when it did not work I pulled it out and the stupid thing fell into little pieces.  It would cost more to mail it back and get a refund then it is worth.  I guess you get what you pay for and that is the last time I buy anything from this company!

Shipping from this vendor was very fast too

It doesn't come with an AC for itself, but works with most of ACs & I have plenty of them.  My experience showed that it requires over 6hours to fully charge when it is nearly empty.  I wish it would charge a bit faster, but I typically charge over night while I am sleeping, so I don't have complain.  Charging iTorch via AC is faster (10-15mins) than via PC.
9978	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This battery was NOT an LG battery.  The image does not clearly show fully the size of the battery, or she shape of the connectors.  They were wrong, and do not work with my phone.  The item in the photo is NOT LG compatible.  The photo carefully does NOT show the part that fits into the phone, which is NOT the kind that works with LG.  Is a completely broken object of garbage that did not work for two seconds.  I did NOT have enough money that month for these jerks to be wasting it.  Do not buy this at all!!!
7521	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I've used mine for less than a month and it is falling apart in two places. In fact, I have had to stop using it because of the risk of it falling off my belt. The metal clip is too sharp and was ruining belts, so I used the belt loop instead. That makes the metal clip dig in to my side unless I place it carefully, and the clip on the inside puts pressure on the belt loop, which has made it split.




I got this so I wouldn't have to carry a cell phone and my Palm Pilot.  Entering and viewing appointments is just average, my Palm was much better.
I lost my Plantronics 510, so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews.  Other may have a great experience with this earpiece.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them.  Maybe I got a "bad" one.







So far, first impressions are:
There is a LOUD *POP* at the beginning and end of each songs - that means two loud pops between tracks. It usually cuts off the first half-second of the song. Every time I push buttons to navigate the menus on the phone, there is the same LOUD *POP*. Between songs, there is a pause - sometimes short, sometimes long, and sometimes it is stuck until I push some buttons.

7228	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It appears this phone is being sold as a new phone when it fact I believe it's been refurbished.  Opened box to find a phone that had different colored part in blue.  The back and flip portion of phone was a different blue from rest of phone.

2629	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.
Well, usually I had found that Sony's would be even better than Motorola's, but with this headset, it has performed better than any Sony I have had and tested. And the 3 different ear hooks to choose from is such a nice additional feature. I finally have a headset that I can shake my head or move it fast in any way, and it is well-fastened to my ear, while still comfortable.
The battery life seems to be shorter than my Plantronics Voyager 510, but it's understandable with the much smaller size of the WEP200.  I really haven't had an issue with the battery, as long as I remember to take it out of the car with me to charge overnight or during the day.  I have to take it with me because, as of March 2008, there doesn't seem to be a car charger accessory for this headset.

3566	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	The item was not as described. It failed to mention that the battery needed to be replaced. Even after it was charged for hours and became fully charged,  it died after 5 minutes of being on. This indicates an old/defective battery, so now I have no use for the GPS.
The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a "My Location" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)

Note that you need to be very close to the internal device for maximum boost, but you will probably get some signal in an entire room that had none before. Picture a basement office that has no signal, and an upstairs that has a decent signal. you should get a very good signal in the basement office.

9971	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My parents (ages 79 and 80) have a very basic LG phone.  They know how it works and how to use it so when the battery was no longer holding a charge, we discussed the unfortunate possibility of replacing the phone.  I had no problems finding a replacement battery for it so decided to buy 2.  The price was excellent, the delivery was very quick and these replacements are not aftermarket copies!  They are the real deal and they are both holding charges as brand new batteries should!  Thank you for saving my parents the frustration of having to learn a new phone again!

506	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	No wonder it is "Amazon's Choice."  For my new iPhone X, I bought several headphone adaptors from Amazon, and only this product works perfect with my earphone & selfie.  I returned other adaptors and bought this adaptor again.

Also, for my installation, I am able to tuck away the main unit and just have the little black desktop antenna sitting on a shelf.  With the z-boost, you have the big white and yellow unit with lights and antenna sitting out.

74	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.
4365	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Looks good and works just as described, except that the compartment is not big enough for credit cards or ID's. It is great for memory cards or memory card adapters, which is exactly what I needed it for (I use a microSD card, and I carry the adapters in it).
Highly recommend. I was a little bit worry when I ordered the item, but now I am totally fall in love with it.
4968	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Does the job as described.  Looks are clean and efficient. Construction is thin and lightweight. Whether that's a pro or a con depends on how you use it.  I would recommend.
1657	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Not much to say about this one - its one of those products that just works, you get it, and off you go.
2382	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This Bluetooth is so small and discrete yet it picks up your voice perfectly.  I highy recommend it!
Also, I think the belt-clip/charger needs some sort of positive lock to prevent losing the headset which with its light weight makes little noise when it's dropped and to secure its position while charging.
 Picture caller ID
You do not need another headset period. This thing does it all, and it does it well. I am very happy with it.

2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.

4004	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	AAA  GOOD
2. Very comfortable to wear for long periods
Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the device and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a rechargeable external battery option.  On a scale of 1-5 I would give this a 4.5.  (Note:  I have only tested the device with the iPhone 4s)
3	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I liked it because it was cute, but the studs fall off easily and to protect a phone this would not be recommended. Buy if you just like it for looks.

2974	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I originally had the black wep, which worked fine.  I upgraded to the red sync from cingular and wanted the red wep.  Everyone I spoke to told me I sounded like I was in a tunnel, could never hear me, which wasn't an overall good experience.  Cute in color, small and useful, but no one could hear me clearly when I was on it.
1756	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The main reason I chose this unit was that it's hyped as USB compatible. Don't be mislead here: This does not use a USB mini charger like the Motorola Razr, instead it they give you a little adapter that fits into a USB computer plug. Therefore the unit cannot be charged unless you have one of their devices. I thought it made infinite sense to have a universal charger for headsets, cameras, palm pilots, cell phones etc. This is NOT what you get here.
The device uses four blue LED lights to show charging status/remaining capacity. It is very intuitive, and pleasing to see.
3112	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I like these better than a lot of those pre-cut ones you can buy.  I just cut a rectangle the size of the screen and stick it on.  They can sometimes be a little frustrating to get on with no bubbles.
4836	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have gotten a couple of these as OEM versions for pretty cheap, and i really like this product. The flip open boom mic allows me to keep it off when im driving, and when someone calls, all i need to do is open it up and put it on and it automatically connects the call and is recognized by my iphone as the default audio device. I really only use it in my car, but the volume buttons work well and the battery does not need to be charged that often.

==========================

1753	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Great basket! I set it up in my back yard and have been casually throwing here and there. I usually put it under my deck after I'm done so it doesn't get too beat up in the outside elements. It disassembles easily, so I've taken it out to the park to play in different terrain. I would recommend going to a hardware store and picking up some heavier duty chains and S hooks to make it more like a professional basket. Some shots that would work on the course, fall out of the basket due to the chains.
I recommend it.
9329	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This inexpensive product doesn't seem like it would perform too well but i've tried several brands of bluetooth headsets and this one is by far the best.  The price is excellent for such a high quality bluetooth headset.  I bought it for my father and he is not very techy but he finds it easy to use.  Once I set it up for him (which was a piece of cake) he's been able to use it without problems.  The range is excellent and you can leave the phone downstairs and go all over the house and still have a clear signal.  No bluetooth headset will ever sound as good as talking on the phone itself but this one comes very very close.  The sound is crystal clear and there is no static or echo sound like some other brands have.  You can talk for several hours without killing the headsets battery.  I would highly recommend this inexpensive, light weight, fast charging headset to anyone.
Unit works well.  Took call and it muted the a2dp and switched over.  For some reason the call was entirely on the right channel.  Person I talked to said I sounded like I was in a tunnel, but conversion was completely intelligible.
-No automatic "push" email - you have to either manually retrieve, poll at an interval (with software like Snapper) or use a third party push like Seven or Sprint Business Connection

4344	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Sure, the case offers no little slot, for instance, for charging the iPhone 3GS, which you might want to do if you were driving your car and had the case hooked to your belt. But, importantly, it does fasten to one's belt and hold the expensive and precious iPhone securely--and I wouldn't want to have it fall out of my jacket pocket and hit the pavement, as happened frighteningly often to my Blackberry--particularly when I was climbing into or exiting my car.
Cons:

I'm happy with this purchase.
All in all, I highly recommend the Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset.  When I finally break or lose this one, I will look at replacing it with another Aliph model before any other manufacturer.
Mine came with a holster and belt clip. The problem I have with the clip is that it is very loose and easy to open but the phone has not fallen off of my belt yet. Time will tell.

I thought I lost my 510, so after reviewing all the newer units, I bought another one! The newer models appear to be riddled with minor bugs & issues, so why not stick with a winner? I'm now using this with my T-Mobile Dash and it works great for the voice command features. My office was trying to decide on which model to go with, so we ordered up a half a dozen latest models of headsets. I added my own to the evaluation pool. After two weeks of testing, almost everyone liked the 510 better than all the rest, so we ordered up 20 of them! If this model was discontinued and I needed a new headset, I'd go with the latest "jawbone"; which worked fine, had better wind resistance, but didn't have quite the all-day comfort or inherent design durability of the 510. Hope this helps!
Downside So far I've only seen this in black. I'd like to see it in a different color so I can tell the difference between mine and my wifes' phone. Another negative, but expected, is that you have to remove it if you want to use a dock. But it does not interfere with the charging cable and does not block the speakers or camera.
Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.

Battery life is great and pairing to any device has also been great. I've paired with Android and iOS devices without any issues.
I've ruined several knives and spoons because they made their way into the garbage disposal when I wasn't looking. When I turned the garbage disposal on, the ensuing noise let me know that something good was not happening.


3648	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The case fits the Razr well and is light weight. The clip is sturdy and holds well to the belt. The USB port is readily accessible for charging. However; to use phone, you must remove the clip from the belt causing wear/scratches on the belt. If wear on your belt is no issue, this would be an excellent choice. I switched to a horizontal mount with no access to the USB port.
6. Suprising battery life, which is a good thing, given the battery is not user replaceable.
Update on 8/16/08:
The TPU material is essentially a hard rubber. Too hard and shiny to keep the phone from sliding on your car's dash, so if you're looking for soft rubber, keep looking. The material itself is naturally on the less-than-premium side, meaning it will build up scratches from constant use. Better that this gets scratched than the GS4's own cheap plastic outer surface. The shiny "X" on the back will pick up finger prints. Not a biggie unless you have a pet peeve about such things.

2) I have had no problems with the volume, as a previous reviewer stated. In fact, it is louder than earphones plugged directly into my phone.
I have used this driving with the windows open and everything on both ends was crystal clear.
Now the bad: The head set would loose it's pairing with the phone frequently.  This of course would require re-pairing it.  Not a burdensom thing but a bit of a bother.
1012	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I got these because my signal is marginal in several places.  I am not convinced that it works or not.  I have tested it by placing it behind the battery in my phone and then checking signal strength.  It seems to give me about a bar better signal on my Samsung Quadband phone.  Worth the investment if you are in a marginal area...even if it just makes me think it is a little better!
8666	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	The charger looks good and charges the iphone (as long as your computer is awake) but as soon as the computer goes to sleep, the dock begins to DRAIN the iPhone battery.  This is a major design flaw.  I will consider purchasing a new generation Innodock only if they fix this major issue.
battery: it's on par with K790a, the battery claimed is kinda conservative
Then I saw a kiosk at a mall and bought a plastic case with a belt clip.  First of all, the quality was absolutely horrendous.  It barely stayed shut and the molding was horrible.  It was thin and the belt clip that slid into place along the back was made of plastic about as thick as two sheets of paper.  I didn't trust it.  If I were to forget that I had it clipped into my belt and bumped it into my chair while sitting down or something the clip would've definitely broken off.
Batteries do not make proper contact so it doesn't charge your phone. Other reviewers had the same experience, shame on Energizer for selling such a crap product.


5737	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	After charging overnight, I paired this with my HTC 8525 PDA phone from Cingular (AT&T).  Unless I am willing to hold the phone next to the headset, the Bluetooth connection gets very noisy and will likely drop/disconnect.  This not only looks ridiculous, but doesn't qualify as hands-free.

They are both small enough that I have actually carried them in my pocket at the same time while it was charging. I get about 2 charges before I have to plug it back up to recharge.

9089	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I received the IMP52D iTorch external battery, on Sept 21st - fast shipping.  The packaging is great, very easy to open and get to the product.  The included cables are good, but I have been using a retractable micro usb.  It just keeps things neat I think.  I like the laser pointer and used it a few times to point something out.  I think the flashlight is extremely bright, and has come in handy a few times.  I have been charging my phone for the past week with it, instead of the wall plug, and have got 5 charges out of it before it seemed like it was going to die, HTC evo 4g.  I like the blue light indicator of remaining charge, very clean looking.  I wish it could charge a Xoom, but I guess that requires a higher voltage.  The build is solid and looks like quality material.  Kind of reminds me of a block phone like a Nokia.  It is small enough to carry without really noticing you have it in your pocket.  Very good for someone who travels and needs some extra charge on a long flight or even a weekend camping.  I am bringing it with me this weekend on a long flight and am confident it will get me through six hours of video on my phone.  Overall it gets a 5 out of 5 from me.  Hope this review helps. - Ryan
-Charges my dead iPhone 2x's while using the phone, probably more if I didn't use (surfing, talking, etc) it while charging.
Search for Voyager 520 on Amazon, and check it out, if the 510 didn't quite work for you.
8135	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is a nice small size organizer that I keep on a corner table by my couch.  I keep a bluetooth headset, a Z-wave minimote, and a few chargers on it for when I want to charge my phone while watching tv.  It's great to have to keep little gadgets organized in a small space.  This organizer does not come with a charger, so I used an Anker 5 port USB desk charger which fits perfectly in the back compartment.  Fitting the different USB cables through the four holes was a bit of a challenge and some of the items I put onto this organizer will only fit in it awkwardly, and the leather material feels a little cheap, but it's good for the price, this is a great electronic organizer.
- 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)
- The size and feel is very comfortable to hold so it makes great use as a flashlight or laser pointer, plus is it small enough to be very portable.

The sound quality of this headset is very good. People can hear me clearly and I can hear them quite well, actually. Most headsets suffer the bane of crappy volume levels; the Voyager 510 seems to amplify the volume so that normally-soft phone calls are clear and audible.
- To activate the charge should be at least one click not 5 seconds
As you can see I really don't have much bad to say about this device. I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I can't find the pack that came with it. It still works! I replaced this unit with the Plantronics Discovery 925 and I might like that even better. For the money though you cannot beat the Voyager 510 in my opinion. 5 stars!

7095	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	We received the BR50 battery a few days ago for my wife's RAZR cell phone.  She tried using it for a few days after charging it and it won't hold a charge after making a couple of calls. It is actually worse than the old battery we tried to replace. It turns out this "new" battery was made in 2006, according to the code on the battery.  The old battery that we were replacing was made in 2007! So we put the old battery back in. I probably won't bother to try to get a replacement since I only paid $7.29 for it. If you buy one of these try to verify the manufacture date ahead of time.
Its unfortunately that they couldn't include a lighting USB cord with it
Do not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window. These will give you that same result and you don't have to climb into your attic or bore holes in your home to hang an external antenna. More importantly, they cost about $100 less.
Back it goes. So glad I spent the extra $4 so I would have it in time for a weekend trip.
These are extremely minor gripes considering the excellent performance of this great headset and its remarkably low price. Considering it comes with Plantronics's spectacular customer service, there really is no reason to look anywhere else for a stereo bluetooth headset. This one is a winner.

4874	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I previously owned the H700 headset and loved it but needed support for 2 phones since I carry my personal cell phone and work phone as well during the day. I was disappointed to find out when I opened this that Motorola changed the more universal mini-USB plug charger with a new connector that is proprietary from what I can tell. This headset looks nearly identical to the H700 and works well in every other way but this new connector looks to me like a money grab to sell accessory chargers. I have no trouble using the headset for a couple days without recharging but if I do buy a car charger I will make every effort to avoid Motorola accessories so as not to reward their bad behavior.

* No playlist support for the music software.
946	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I purchased the Motorola Buds after my LG HBS-700's had a left ear malfunction after a couple of years of use.  I looked around for something better, since the HBS-700's were originally created back in 2011 and everywhere I look someone has the LG's, either the 700 or 800 series, or a knockoff.  I wanted something different, and thought that the Motorola Buds would be better in every way given that it is new technology.  I was wrong.

6667	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Verizon has a code you can dial to change your bars to an actual dba reading (google it to find), the lower the number the better.  I was around 92 dba.  With this device installed, i dropped down to between 68-72 dba.  Great product!  The absolute most important part of the installation is LOCATION.  Just a very small turn of the antenna makes a big difference.  I installed my on a 6' tall steel pole on top of the house.  I stood on the roof with my phone, I turned ever so slightly until I found the best dba direction, then I pointed the antenna in that direction.  The inside positioning of the booster and receiver makes a difference as well, but what i found is the outside antenna is where the big improvement will come from.  And yes, I live way out in the sticks.  No internet other than Hughes, so now we have Verizon hotspot and with the booster, we are at least double the speed we were with Hughesnet.

7994	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	this came quickly, it works and it always saves me money from having to buy these kinds of products at the mall or on the street corner for $6-10. You can't go wrong with this product.
429	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The phone end of the charging cable is the weak point of the Palm Pre and is NOT the standard USB end. The charger end IS standard USB and plugs into any USB charger or computer jack. The one that came with the phone wasn't making good contact. This one works perfect and the price was right.
The case covers Phone, Calender, Mail, and Home buttons. But the picture does not show these button are being covered.
Cons--
It would get 5 stars except for its funky charger and lack of noise cancellation.  C'mon Plantronics, what's wrong with Mini-USB?  We all have one if we travel since we mostly have laptops or palm-type devices, so we can charge that way.  This "500 different charger" game is getting old, and its pointless.  Noise cancellation is difficult to do well and frankly I've yet to find any other headset that does a good job there either, so I'm not going to be too hard on this one over that issue.
There is no reason to have flashing status lights on a device I CAN'T SEE!


527	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Good...The cell coverage has gotten better as far as talk, but the data service still is not working correctly and my MMS does not work right either. This is a carrier thing, not a phone thing though.
806	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got my v600 over a month ago. I use it with my T-mobile service in Hungary. At first I was somewhat disappointed with my phone because I could not get some of the internet functions to work. However, after some discussion with T-mobile customer service and a visit to the T-mobile office, I discovered that T-mobile had not properly prepared my phone...not Motorola's fault!

Here's to another 6 years.
I also bought a LG stereo headset for my daughter's LG Chocolate phone. I tried it with the 2.5mm plug adaptor (part # SYN1505A) that comes with the Krzr k1m phone, and the LG headset works great with the k1m. The headset has a volume control, a microphone and a button to answer the phone.  When the button is pushed to answer the phone, it pauses the music player.  After pushing the button again to end the call, the music player comes back.
Overall, Plantronics has a winner on it's hands with this one!
I liked this so much I bought one for my wife. Her older phone (Motorola V557) drops the bluetooth signal much more often than mine does. Also, she goes outside more often than I do, and it seems like sunlight interferes with the bluetooth radio frequency. My wife loves keeping her phone on silent with the headset, because this way the baby doesn't wake up whenever a phone call comes in. My wife's complaint is that the signal gets dropped a lot, but she sometimes leaves the phone in the living room whenever she makes a quick trip to the bedroom - and that's just too far away.

8985	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I took a cross country road trip by myself and dog which took a day and a half.  There was something wrong with my phone charger wires so I wasn't able to fully charge my phone in the car or outlets.  So I was unable to use my phone in the last hours of my trip, since it was completely dead.  Even though I made the trip safely I knew I needed some kind of external battery charger, so I bought this.  I'm very pleased.  It's very sleek and does the job.  The wire fits my Nokia N8 perfectly and works fine with our iPads and iPhones.  I like the red laser but I do have trouble turning on the flash light.  But practice makes perfect so I know that would stay a problem.  I keep it in my car but I can keep it in my pocket since its so sleek and a good size for pockets.  I recommend this.

I am disappointed so far in the fact that it DOES NOT serve as a USB mass storage device.  You seem to need the driver for _phone_ in order to access files on the phone.  I've also purchased the 2gig microSD flash card for additional storage.  If you plan to use any extra feature (mp3s, photos, video) - I would recommend getting it. They can be found for less than $30.
So, I had to find another alternative. Someone here at Amazon mentioned in their review that they used the Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) with success. I broke down and ordered this, investing more than I had intended, but was pleased to find that the Motorola S805 headphones indeed work with this Sony Transmitter. I haven't used it much to do further testing, but it seems to work fine at close range; walking out of the room cuts the signal in and out, and if it totally drops you have to re-sync it. But I'm usually sitting on the couch, less than 10 feet away, and so far it works like a charm.



765	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product Awesome price
  The reason I rated this item so low is because it does not hold up.  My husband and I have gone through three of these chargers in less than a year.  It seems that we can only plug the charger into the car's outlet about four times before the end of the charger breaks off.  Twice this has left the metal tip and fuse inside of the accessories outlet in my car, and once even blew the fuse to my outlet.
I have also purchased the older HF800 since it was have the price.  (The HF800 is silver rather than black with also a different visor holder).  I use this unit with my Autocom motorcycle intercom system that I got at [...]  This allows me to have my Treo 650 in my jacket and connect wirelessly to the intercom system via the HF800.  It eliminates the RF inference from the phone radio on the intercom since I have distance between them and the sound is as good as being directly plugged in.  I just plug the Autocom intercom cable into the headphone jack on the Motorola HF800/HF820 (yes it is a speaker phone and wireless connection for a headset too).  I have not tried the voice dialing yet (extra software needed on a Treo), but I can already answer a call by pressing the blue button on the HF800 or start a call while stopped and continue down the road with the phone in my pocket.
Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to "not work" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...

Battery life:
 * First received it, lights 2, 3, & 4 come on, one at a time, left to right and stay lit until all 3 are on - then they shut off and the cycle repeats -
182	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Although it does charge, albeit slower than my original, it does not work to sync it with either my laptop or desktop. My primary purpose for the purchase was to sync the pictures and music from my phone, which the product does not work for.



93	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Good product
Overall I think this was the sturdiest case for the iPhone that looks attractive. Negatives are the clip and the lack of a protective film.

I bought this because i loved the Jabra 250 and I still use it, as a matter of fact.
The protector itself is much sturdier than screen protectors you may have used in the past (for an iPod or Palm, for example). It's not the flimsy, flexible stuff.  For example, if a standard screen protector that you'd get at a big box store was the equivalent flexibility of a sheet of notebook paper, then this one would be the equivalent of a business card.

Reversible. Can use with Screen facing in or out depending upon use.

It recharges my devices at least 3 times before it needs to be recharged. It works with the USB/Micro plug that comes with my devices.
5416	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This cheap car charger does the job. It charges your samsung cell phone while you're on the road. I highly recommend.
6696	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	The 801247 was the perfect solution for us.  It was installed in a 100' x 40', metal roofed building with the antenna mounted above the roof. Before it was installed cell phone reception in the building was very poor (and phone battery life was drastically reduced) unless you were near an outside wall.  Now reception is great anywhere within the building.  We had considered the next model up from this one (the 841262) - but because we had a very strong signal outside the building decided to go with this one and we are happy with our choice.
12	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful quality and outstanding product! Everyone compliments me on the case and thinks I spent wayy wayy more than I really did :)
5223	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great, just as described.
4484	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I found this headset a mainstay for a little over a year. Good battery life, voice pickup, and decent sound quality while on a call. Also, surprisingly tough.
8519	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Works
Note: Double-stack cards to stretch the leather if you prefer a more loose fit.
Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.
Seller aside, the item seems to work pretty well. Fits my wife and I box (I have a big head and she has a tiny one). It paired pretty easily to both our Ipod Touch and iMac.


4165	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great product, Great price. I have not had any complaints about not being able to hear me where I did with my other bluetooths. The only thing I would suggest to make it better is you can't tell if the noise sheild is on or off, everything sounds the same to you, you have to wait till some one ask what is the noise in the back ground. I would buy this product again and suggest it to my friends.
3) The fit and finish is top notch. Really. This phone is *very* pleasing to the touch. I was intimidated by the width at first. It's pretty wide, but again, you adapt and move on. The chrome mixed with the bluish-black exterior is very elegant yet informal. The device lures you in!

* The charge life seems good, but I have never let it run down since the headset is stored in the battery charger unit. This keeps the unit charged at all times.

Twice the 655 fell off my ear, once into  pile of leaves. It took some time to find all three pieces (the earbud, loop and headset device).
What I have found is:
4086	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've waited a few months to write this review, so as to see if the product would break as so many have claimed it would "in 24 hours" or "in a week."
All in all, this is a great smartphone and I am extremely pleased with it.  It is reassuring to know I have the equivalent of everything from an MP3 player to a camera to an internet portal to a video player--all that and a great phone too!  After 3 weeks with this device, I unequivocally recommend it those in search of a quality smartphone.
8054	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	Ok first downside (which isn't that bad) is that once you get your sena case its abit tight for the iphone 3g. To fix this problem I put my Creative Zen Vision:M 30gb mp3 player to stretch the leather out and let it sit there inside the leather case for 2 hours(you could also use your ipod or something similar in size just abit thicker in depth to stretch the case). Now your iphone 3g could easily come out of the case with no hassle.
I'm really thankful...

2187	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love this product, I received it in the mail last week, loaded it and moved pictures, made my own ring tones. Loaded the phone book, into outlook express. It worked great! My daughter and her girl friend both downloaded ring tones, and downloaded pictures without any problems.
4576	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	First of all, I have added an image that you can use to judge the size of the protector on an iPhone 3G. I know it's hard to see a clear protector in a small photo, but in the image my iPhone is in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/this-case/dp/B001CHBNZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">this case</a>, which perfectly covers the edges of the screen protector on all sides, so there's no chance of pulling up the corners or getting dust, etc. around the edges of the protector.  There's a cut out semi-circle for the Home button.




Holds an amazing charge!
8079	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	My husband HATED wearing a bluetooth headset (none of them seemed to fit right).  We both were quite excited to see this product available and couldn't wait to get it.  It lives up to the JABRA standards-  works very well, and looks great.  It is very simple to get set up and to use.  We couldn't be more pleased with our purchase!!!
In any case, I ended up installing my antenna outside on my TV antenna mast. In general, higher up should be better to avoid the obstruction of buildings, etc. You should check the location of the nearest tower that serves your area and your carrier. There are websites that can help with this (e.g. [...]) or you can simply contact your carrier directly. Once you know your nearest tower location, you should locate your antenna so that there is as much of a clear view as you can achieve to that site. Of course, a totally clear view may not be possible. You should try to avoid metal structures, concrete stuctures (they have metal reinforcements), etc. Trees and vegetation should be less of a problem. Some wood frame houses will block reception and some won't. It depends on what is inside and if they have some hidden metal like mine has.

1905	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I got the HT820 a few days ago and for the most part I am very happy with it. Contrary to what some people have said, it *does* simultaneously connect with a phone and PC. I am using a Treo 700p PDA phone and a Lenovo X60 Thinkpad with integrated Bluetooth. If it doesn't do that for you, it is most likely a driver/SW problem with your phone and/or PC. It takes two to tango and people are all too ready to blame the headset when it is just as likely to be a problem with their source.
They may be a great "deal", but DOA means NO DEAL !!
6130	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This battery never worked. Would not hold a charge. I left it plugged in over night and the battery never charged up.

Overall, a great product and worth the price I paid for it.
336	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Lasts much longer than standard battery.  Wife seems happy with it.
3903	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	My wife and I love the pattern and flow of this shower head... it's the best one we've had by far. The only downside (for me personally) is the amount of water that comes out of this thing. I'd hate to see what the flow was without the restrictor inside of it. I try to conserve water at every turn and am working on a way to reduce the flow of this head even more. Contrary to popular belief, water is NOT an unlimited resource!
My only "complaint" is that you have to make sure to plug in the wires with a little force until you hear/feel a tough click.

There's also an awesome camera. This phone was built around the camera. It's a 5MP digital camera, and like the Prada, has Schneider Kreuznauch-certified optics. For those who don't know about Schneider's optics, think Swarovski, Leica, Minox, Steiner, and Carl Zeiss, and you get an idea of the quality. the pictures came out great, and the video recording is some of the best I've seen for a camera phone, besting even some camcorders! Some have said the camera isn't that great compared to Sony Ericsson's or Nokia's N95, and if you don't know how to use it, it's not, but there's a lot of adjustments you can make to it to improve picture quality.
It can be a little bit annoying  to assemble and also to put into the car, but once you get used to it, it's really not too bad. Definitely saved me from having to buy a larger vehicle to separate my huskies (they are not capable of sharing a seat).
6953	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This product works exactly as advertised. In fact, based on what I had read in the other reviews I would actually say that it works better than advertised. The suction cup works so well that the only thing I can figure is that the person that had problems with it did not understand how it worked. It is not the standard type of suction cup where you simply press it against the windshield and hope it holds. This suction cup works by placing it against the windshield and then turning the knob counterclockwise in order to pull the center portion away from the windshield. As it does this it creates a vacuum seal that so tight that you are more likely to dislodge the windshield than you are to remove this device from it.
This type of cover is a proven design, with no surprises. It's stiff enough and lightly padded and gives pretty good protection. I have it in the Blue trim version. It looks exactly like the Amazon photos.
9497	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought this because cell phone signal was bad.  This works great for one room.  I upgraded to larger one.  But if you have small house or just service bad in part of house this should work for you.  Trust me it works.
I usually fold the Plantronics 510 into a flat configuration before droping it in my shirt pocket when Im not wearing it.  Folded, its slightly bigger than my previous MOT, but its advantage of putting it on my ear with one hand and the isolating abilities of its earpiece outweigh the small size advantage of the HS850.  And the friction fit recharge plug will never rip the guts out of this BT earpiece.



6915	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	What can I say,  they work and they are at a good price, and I didn't have to leave my home to get them.
7355	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I used this phone for a really long time.  I even bought a replacement when the first one broke because I really like the design.  However, I finally had to let it go because the front flap screen was too fragile and broke easily.
3827	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	It worked like a charm, so to speak, at first, but stopped working after only a couple days. Soon after that, the pieces came apart. It just wasn't up to being carried around in a purse.
No issues with the merchant - quickly shipped and delivered just fine.  The low rating here is about the speakerphone, not the merchant.

77	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.
 Easy to slip it on and alle the ports, buttons and stylus are easily accessible.
I received the unit today and the packaging was the first thing that caught my attention.  It's in a trifold type package...the actual handset on one side, the base and handset on the other and underneath are the connections and an installation CD for Outlook.  In the middle of the packaging is a slot on the side which contains the instructions.
9650	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very useful for watch lovers!


9186	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	LOVE THIS PRODUCT. MUCH EASIER TO USE UNSTEAD OF CHANGING INTERNAL BATTERIES ALL THE TIME. USE IT QUIT OFTEN DROID 2 GLOBAL. HAVE CHARGED UP PHONE 4 TIMES AND ALL LIGHTS STILL LIT.  VERY QUICK. LOVE ALL DIFFERENT ATTACHMENTS.  CHARGE MY I PAD AS WELL.

I am adding a few comments after owning this antenna booster for more than three months. I have found, as the instructions indicate that getting proper spacing between the outdoor and indoor antenna is critical. I added on another 20 feet of cable so I could get more horizontal separation between the indoor and outdoor antenna. It made a world of difference. I am now getting 4G (65 dbm HSPA+) reception with no variation in signal. Horizontal separation is more important than cable length.
I am very satisfied and I would buy from them again.
Does not get too warm when charging like many other devices similar to this.

8329	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	MORE THAN JUST THE CAMERA

I purchased this item from Amazon's seller and hoped for the best.  I was not disappointed.  The ear bud arrived and had the Motorola logo and the sound was perfect.  I have no idea why there would be static on the buds, as reported by several users, but that was not a problem with mine.
I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.
So basically, if you have full bars (a strong signal) outside of your home, then the boosted signal inside your home will be greater. I want everyone to know this. DO NOT BE MISGUIDED!!!! This system is only as good as your signal outside your home. If you have FULL strength outside your home and have no signal strength inside your --- a basement for example, then, you will have good coverage in your basement room ONLY.


3075	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The case is a good buy for the mobile scanner. It is a bit tight, which is why I did not rate it 5 stars. The case holds both the scanner and the USB cable for the device. the case is very sturdy and seems like it will protect the scanner very well. Maybe over time the tightness will lessen, but this does not detract from the protection it provides.
pointer to its primary battery function, useful for business travel.
It's not worth returning and will just throw it away and go back to the old way of doing it.

User interface is easy.
The included laser pointer and flashlight were very handy and useful add ons, though as a minor complaint, it would be nice if those were on the opposite end of the pack from the usb port/charging port. But since you can quickly disconnect it to use it as a flashlight thats an extremely minor complaint.
696	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	i appreciate the option of returning mistakenly ordered products for a nominal fee

4325	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	After reading all the reviews it appeared this was a very good headset except for the oversized part that fits in your ear.  Since I am a big guy I figured this would not be a problem for me.  I was wrong.  It will not stay on your ear (keeps falling off when I bend over or chew) and it will not fit in my ear properly either.  On top of that I had many complaints from callers on the other end about call clarity and having a hard time hearing me.  I have tried many bluetooth headsets and have finally found one that fits good, easy to wear, and I have had no complaints from callers.  In fact when I asked some people they said I didn't sound like I was in a well and echoing like in the past.  The headset I ended up with is the Plantronics Windsmart Voyager 510 ($40 at Amazon).  I hope this is helpful to some of you.
Phonebook - Good! Has tons of entries, is easy to use. I wish it would do full name searching, rather than starting with only the first name or the last name but I guess that is a smartphone-only feature for now.
836	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Got my Mom this Bluetooth and she loves!  Thanks!
2363	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I really like this inexpensive lightweight bluetooth headset!  Works well on my end, but sometimes the person on the other end of the call hears an echo.  Stays in my ear great without the clip that goes around your ear.  It charges up in a protective flip top box, so the headset doesn't have to plug directly into wall charger.  I store my headset in the small charging box and carry it in the small box in my pocket when not in use.  I love it that this was only $18!!!  Can't beat that price!!
7236	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I like it very much,but delivery is too long
1980	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Purchased this battery from Battery Supersite for a 12v spotlight that I have owned for a number of years, but haven't used it for over a year for lack of a battery.  The battery arrived through the U.S. mails within a few days of ordering it and was packaged well.  The battery contacts pointed the wrong direction, but a few minutes with pliers changed their direction.  The spotlight works really well now. Halogen bulb is extremely bright with the new battery, so battery was fully charged and works quite well at the present time.  Battery seems to be well constructed and so far I have no complaints.
From a sound level standpoint the unit is great.  It is down right loud and I can hear the person on the other end with no problem even with my stereo partly on.


7543	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I buy a lot of these and they always rip where the belt goes through. I have been through about 10 this year so far.
The volume does not seem like it gets loud enough.

Cons:
2848	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works just fine!
1832	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I have this phone and I do not recommend it. My provider is T-Mobile, who I also do not recommend because of their unhelpful and unfair business practices. I had a billing dispute and they turned off my phone without warning (complained to the Better Business Bureau and T-Mobile has since restored my service).
Problem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.

FIRST CONS: Very little cons, but still some that people need and might want to hear when purchasing a cell phone. First one being if you hold up the max of how many messages you can have, it takes FOREVER to erase all of them. It took like 30 minutes to erase the 100 I had in inbox and sent. After finally finishing up erasing, I only hold up to like 20 because I don't want to have to wait and clean the mailbox and have it take a long time.

8)  If you plan to use Excel and Word, you can definitely do it with this device, but it will definitely get some getting used to. There's nothing I need to do in Excel or Word that I can't wait until I get back to my PC to do.

- The battery cover is loose!  The cover does not sit snugly on the back of the phone, and it rattles around when you hold the phone to your ear.  People on the other end of the line complained about hearing a rattling noise.

I'm very happy with this product. If they can make the charging DC in using micro USB instead of the round pin, it would be an even better product. However, I can see a lot of careless users will be calling tech support to ask how to use that Micro USB port.
8815	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I got this for my buddy and he loved it! It wasn't as much as the 7000mAh I have from New Trent but this one packs plenty of juice to provide long hours of charge and even more to share if needed. I recommend this as well and its portability is greater than the other one I own which is larger but flatter. This one fits right in the pocket if needed!
However,I am extremely pleased with this item. I feel this item lives up to its expectations.
I think the best use of this item will be for those that have somewhat alternative means of installing the antenna, or are ok using it for special trips that might have poor cell coverage.
5530	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Works great so far, very happy with time for shipping and it plugs into USB a huge plus while on the road with laptop.

I've been using them for two weeks without any issue.  I hope they are durable and continue to live up to my everyday use.
UPDATE, 2/10/07: The usability issues that I mentioned, plus the lack of third-party applications finally got to me. My employer just added support for Windows Mobile devices, so I've replaced my 8700c with a Cingular 8525.
Cons:

2692	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	son loves it

5905	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Very good device. It charges my galaxy S4 quite fast even with a low battery, very handy when you're traveling. With pretty cool features like a lazer pointer and a light it can come in handy.

2)  The keyboard is designed for tween/teen fingers.  If you've got larger fingers, you'll have some trouble adjusting.  Adjusting is possible, though.  After about 3 weeks, I can type pretty proficiently (though I still look at the keys).
i had to buy another when a power outage (and subsequent power surge) fried the first one.  this newer version works much better.  the range is now about 40-50 feet with a stronger signal strength (according to my android phone).  i now have it plugged into a surge suppressor in case i ever have another power outage.
5183	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This is a rugged case, but you will not be able to sync/charge using a docking stand.  The screen cover is designed poorly and trapped air makes it difficult to see the icons.  There is another popular case that is just as strong and will allow you to dock eaasy.
My first power test showed a weak result, but I think that is not unusal for the first 1-2 times you charge most portable batteries.
It is fairly comfortable to wear, and I am glad it came with 3 ear piece options to see which fits the best, as I did have to try all three to get a comfortable fit--and at times even forget I am wearing it.  I don't talk on it constantly, so have had no problems with battery life so far.  It recharges fairly quickly--maybe within 1 1/2 hours??  I researched and read hundreds of reviews before deciding on this Voyager 510 BT headset, and feel for its relatively inexpensive cost it does a more than decent job.


Its not for me, but may be what you are looking for if you can make it fit.
6070	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The device saved me on the very first day, for some reason my ipad didn't charge overnight and I didn't have my charger at my desk. My ipad was at 40% in a short while. The itorch is a small and yet powerful backup battery. It does everything that it says and comes with a couple extras; a nice carrying back and extra cables. I would not hesitate to recommend this product. If you pay more for another similar device you have been swindled!


I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph.


2662	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	have no idea where it went
-Power button easily depressed when in my purse, so I found a cushioned case to keep that from happening.
5) Instructions on how to set the thing up.  No tools are required and the setup is mostly intuitive.  There are some useful points though.

------------------------------------------
My wife's current alias 2 just started behaving the same way (crashing frequently when texting and when flipping the phone.  It makes me wonder how many people throw out perfectly good phones just because they start crashing.  I wonder how many of those phones could be fixed by replacing the battery? Her phone might actually be going bad, but many people that I've come across in forums report the same thing for the alias 2 (crashing frequently when flipping and texting) but I haven't found a verified claim of anyone trying a battery replacement (because the battery indicator is always full).  With generic batteries being only $5 on the internet, the bet is worth it to me over buying a new phone and contract renewal (or pay up front for a $400 phone...).

Also like the fact that has Flash Light and Laser beam, good for those who have dogs or cats lol.

2.  Yes it works. I thought it was a gimmick. But alas, it works, and works darn well. Does exactly what I need it to do. I have 1-2 bars of service where I am now, and I have absolute zero without the product.

5341	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've read reports of this case not fitting properly for the 8330 specifically but it worked fine for my 8330 example. There are some minor diferences between the other 8300 models and the 8330 but again my case actually fit fine. Makes the BlackBerry VERY Robust! Adds a little bit to the form factor but not enough to outweigh the protection. If you need the most protection available for an 8300 series this is it bar none. The clear plastic will blur the camera some I've noticed; you probably could cut out around the lens and get the clearness back without risking too much. I'm leaving mine sealed up the way it is. I need every ounce of protection this thing provides.

 It powers,  without charging, my Galaxy Tab 10.1 and wifes ipad1.
3424	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I thought that adding a cover and holster would make my phone more bulky but its incredibly slim.  And it makes my phone more sexy.
Can't list multiple #s under one person's name in phone listings. (fax, cell, work, etc.)
*It drops calls almost as much as my old Nokia (which was inexpensive compared to the going cost of this RAZR)


Since this is a PHONE lets talk about calls! Call quality is superb - both reception and transmission. You can talk in the middle of a crowded party and you will still be able to hear very well and your voice will be transmitted to the person on the other end w/o any disturbance due to the powerful noise-canceling mic. I have experienced this myself.
3346	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Terrible, lots of static lines running across the screen.
Installation is easy, but kind of rinky dink. Antenna mounts on the roof with a strong enough antenna. The cable goes through the rear passenger door or window. There is enough cable to run under the seat and up to the dash.  The installation is easy, but not very nice looking.
2845	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I purchased the Zune gear bag for my husband -- who absolutely loves his Zune MP3 player.  I thought he would appreciate it, but not really use it, yaknow, but I was wrong.  He really likes it a lot and uses it all of the time.  We travel quite a bit, so it really comes in handy to protect his player and his accessories.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.
Clarity
The unit goes into standby mode relatively quickly to conserve energy, personally I'd love the option to disable it. It takes 2 seconds to reconnect to the phone but so far no missed calls on its' account.

3902	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Reducing my rating to 2 stars as the nozzles are all getting plugged up and no amount of "massaging" will clear them. I've even tried taking the shower head down and pouring CLR into it and letting is soak with little improvement. We don't have particularly hard water where I live so I was not expecting to be having this issue.
9513	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I'd buy it again, it really helps me pull a cell phone signal into m basement, where I had barely one bar and would get lots of dropped calls, now I am pulling 4-5 bars regularly, like when I am outside on the deck, buy it for a basement for sure!
The fact that it was so cheap is great because I lost the dang thing (kind of expected 'cause it's so easy to misplace being so small and black).  So I went out and bought a 2nd one for the same price.  Now if I paid say $60 for a jawbone I'd been really upset at myself.
2406	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have a special standard for Bluetooth devices. I've had several of them over the last few years. This one is the lightest, and worked well for about a year. Then it stopped. It's been my experience with Bluetooth listening devices that a year is all you can expect, at best. Right now I use a Motorola from Costco that's on it's 4th month. We'll see how long it lasts.

The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.

8757	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	This is Motorola's phone designed for emerging markets.  A great value for the price, it's a durable, reliable phone, but it doesn't do much else.  I bought this to ride out the last two months in my AT&T contract, and it has worked fine.

7800	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	All newer and better BUT they did away with the mini-USB port that I loved on the H700! So if I want to continue using this, I'll have to carry its own charger with me instead of using one for my BlackBerry and my old H700 both! What was Motorola thinking? The new connector is almost the same size as a mini-USB so no real gain there. Shame on you Motorola!!!

I bought my i-go charger YEARS ago when I got my 1st phone, I've bought different tips through the years as I've changed phones and continued 2 use as my car charger! remember it won't charge as fast as a Samsung charger, but if I can use what I already have or keep plugged in while using my phone for GPS, it was a great purchase

561	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	we needed a better signal and thought at $2.99 for a 10 pack would be worth a shot. well, they say you get what you pay for and that was certainly true in this case! expect nothing from this product and you won't be disappointed!  really, don't bother.  if you really need a boost for a signal, i recommend checking your other options. don't waste your time or money.

Pocketability is a big concern for me.  The 510 isn't really pocketable.  I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it.  The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable.  The BT8040 is a micro-sized "brick" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable.

8006	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Months ago I saw a "charging station" in the SkyMall catalog and thought I should build one of those.  It was a nice wooden box in which to hide your chargers and cords.  While designing my charging station I thought about using one transformer and splicing the adaptors in.  Then the old "build or buy" adage hit me and I did an internet search for multi station charger and found Callpod.  I now have it and have nearly finished my charging station.  The Callpod is perfect for this application.  I reduced much of the clutter in my charging station and can charge many devices.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it isn't easy to get all the correct adaptors, so expect to spend another $20-$40 getting all the adaptors you need.  It would be nice if they indexed more camera adaptors, since many of them are the same as the phone adaptors.  Its just that without an index you can never be sure.
The 801247 kit is easy to set up. In fact, it took me longer to get it out of the packaging than it did to set it up. I used the option of attaching it to the inside of a window that faces towards the nearest cellphone tower. The was quite a distance from my desk, but the 50 feet of cable Wilson provides is up to the task. It is great to have it in two lengths in case you don't need to go as far, but I am glad then included a cable connector so that i could use the full length. I plugged the cable into the desktop unit, attached the antenna and plugged it in.
THE PLANTRONICS felt more "snug" on my ear, but since everyone's ear is different I wasn't expecting a custom fit.

6160	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I carry many portable devices and sometimes I'm away from the office or home all day long. It's nice to have this charged and ready to go in case of emergencies. The charge capacity is great for it's size. It's perfect for my iPhone 5, 4G hot spot, and iPad. Probably not fully charging all three on one charge, but enough to last me the day. I don't use the laser pointer or the flashlight at all, though it's nice to know I have it in a pinch. I don't use it everyday. When I do need it, it's great.

2741	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Junk. Must be very old stock and not charging at all.

7199	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Couldn't hear very well out of this device.  It did not fit properly in my ear, and everyone I talked to complained on the humming noise or not being able to hear me.
The charger is a good design that also functions as a carrying case. Overall, I am happen with the purchase.
Even though the Parrot doesn't have an interface for your steering wheel controls (I don't have them anyway), you can still operate some of the key functions via voice recognition.  Because the Parrot voice recognition limits you to half a dozen voice commands, they actually work!
Also of interest is the other feedback saying that this does not measure RF from a wireless source.
I am very disappointed that Motorola would produce a product of this poor quality.  Steer clear of this item.

6370	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	These are nice cases, but they do start to fall apart after a while.  You pay for what you get, but it will be time to upgrade by the time it does fall apart.  It just depends on how you treat the case.
A couple of concerns, one it mentioned not for areas that exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  I'd hate to on a daily basis have to take down the unit and carry it inside, unscrew the antenna to disconnect etc.  The temperature limit is going to be exceeded often even in the Northern United States, maybe not right now in February, but soon enough.  Cars can easily obtain 30+ degrees hotter than that limit sometimes even with the window cracked.  My GPS often gets hot when I parked at a restaurant for lunch on my Chicago commute.  I've had power amplifiers burn up on my dash and even some in dash because of heat.  Now, this company is said to make boost units for outdoor and indoor ATM's and such, so why make something to be used for cars, that with even normal use is likely to overheat and break?  Next, the side stays on this pull off and are adjustable to different phone widths, My BLU phone was already at the outer limit, I suspect there might be wider phones that would work.  That aside, my LG flip phone was much too small to fit even the lowest width adjustment.  There is a growing trend of people wanting some of the older smaller more portable and more battery efficient phones, this would not work for them.  It might however extend the battery transmit life if you talk a lot for the bigger phones.
7310	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Please heed to the reviews that state don't buy the Motorola RAZR V3.  This product does not work in the US.  The feautres of the phone do not function, and the clarity is horrible. The Reseller I used, Unlimited Phones 4 Less, is not a good company to deal with, and I am sorry to say Amazon did nothing to help me get a refund or phones returned.  Now I have 2 Motorola RAZR V3 phones that don't work, and I am out my money. Don't think that just because I had a problem you won't, because you will.  Don't buy this phone.

A 2 Second Hold Click shuts both the LED light and the battery pack off - I don't think it's possible to turn the LED light off and not turn off the battery pack at the same time -
258	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	This product is soo bad on soo many levels.  Can't even bring my iphone 4s to above 50% from a discharge.  Will let you down when you need it the most and takes way too long to fully charge.



Cons:
If you want a QWERTY smartphone but don't want to lug around a bulky unit your choices right now are either this or the Pearl.  And the Pearl does the whole two-letters-on-one-keypad set-up.  If these features are important to you, then the Centro is your choice.  Don't worry, it's internal abilities don't disappoint.  The Centro is great for text messaging, writing quick emails, doing some casual web browsing, and reading through Office files.  However, if you want a better camera, or do HEAVY smartphone typing then I would look to a fatter smartphone that has a bigger screen and more spaced out thumbkeys.  But in a world where size matters...the compact Centro delivers amazingly well.  I've been very happy with my purchase.  Now can somebody help me get this battery cover back on?
Something else I liked was the belt clip.  So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you're not using it.  The belt clip is small, just big enough to actually hold the headset, and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.
If the IMP52D itself is being charged, blue lights 2, 3 & 4 indicating the charging status, whether or not a device is connected, that is they will continue the blink pattern -

No issues with the merchant - quickly shipped and delivered just fine.  The low rating here is about the speakerphone, not the merchant.
8780	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love my Iphone 3G.  It seems every day I find something new it can do.  But all the function comes with a price - really lousy battery life.  The darn thing drains like a sieve when I use wireless - which is a pain as that is often the fastest connection and offers the best flexibility when using all those fantastic Apps.

Anyway, that was a very big downside for me, so I returned it an bought a motorola T305 (since it was made by my phone manufacturer), and this worked as I expected in this regard.

9345	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is my first bluetooth headset, so I can't compare it to others, but I think it's a great product.  It's comfortable to wear, so much though, that I forget I'm wearing it.  It paired instantly with my Blackberry Curve.  The volume could go a bit louder, but the sound quality is great.  And others have told me that they like to hear me speak through it rather than directly to the phone (much clearer for them).
1751	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This thing is the bomb. Setup takes about 5 minutes, and it's easy to break back down if you're wanting to take it with you somewhere. It's lightweight enough to be easily movable, but also heavy enough that it hasn't blown over even during windstorms. So nice to be able to practice putting whenever I want!
6001	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I am a tester for New Trent -- They sent me this, and I loved how it slid right into my pocket.  It comes with a soft bag case, but I find I never use those.
convenience of this device is amazing. Not having to search for an outlet

4538	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I bought it cause it was only [...] and thought what the heck maybe it will work well but was skeptical cause of the low price.  We'll it does work well!  Loud and clear!  Have to raise the volume sometimes but it's plenty loud enough.  Easy fast pairing.
4025	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this case despite some negative reviews due to needing stuff ASAP as Sprint was shipping me my new S4 and i dread not having everything i need right away..I am using this case for a Samsung S4 with a Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover (Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models) [18 Month Warranty] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** and the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case / Cover  for the enlarged battery and Door. This case performed great for 2 weeks, then the GLUE just stopped holding the seams together for all stress points on the case. I bought mine from  DeCi Accessories. I cannot recommend this case.

2437	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I love the carrying case.  I never lose or misplace my headset anymore.  I just clip it to my purse so I always know where it is.
On my road trips i lost around 50% of the time my cell signal, with this booster it went to around 5% of signal loss
3594	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I wasn't expecting much for the price. I was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived before the expected delivery date. Then, I was even more surprised when I opened the package and saw the product. It fit the tablet like a second skin.
+ Loooooooong battery life
If you insert the phone with the camera side up, it is easy to remove one handed but it does not hold the phone as securely.  With the camera side up the flap doesn't close as easily. It still closes, but you have to push it into place a bit more to make it securely latched.  Lastly, in this orientation the side buttons are very accessible but not the top one (unless you open the flap).
Called Wilson, was told they have never heard the happen.  So back it will go, unless I can find someway to get it working correctly.
2947	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I bought two of these and could not get these to work at all. It was a waste of money.

2532	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	very nice
6. High resolution display
Only complaint is that my headset disconnects from my phone about 5 times per day with no explanation.  Doesn't appear to be the phone causing the problem so I may be looking swap this out as defective and get a new one.
Just open the antenna, then search for a device from your cell phone, then add it, then provide the pass code which is written in the Guide Book.

no Bluetooth.
I've gone through various PDA/Smartphones before this one (Treo 650, Treo 700p, Q (silver), T-Mobile MDA, the V from Verizon), so I knew what to expect w/the phone. Its very sleek, very "hold-able", sound quality is very decent (when my chin is not rubbing the mic).
8451	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	[...]
9289	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	Since I have found customer reviews helpful in the past on Amazon, I felt it my duty to warn you about this product.  I was originally sold this product at an independent Verizon wireless store.  Since they didn't have it in stock, they were going to send one for free.  When that didn't happen, I decided to buy another one here.  I was excited that the online price was less than half of what I was going to pay in the store.  Obviously, I learned, yet again, you get what you pay for.  The cover is meant to be used in two ways. 1) You can put the plug in the back and just put it in your pocket, or 2) you can put a different plug in the back and use it as a belf clip.  This was a great concept in theory, but in real life, did not work at all.  The belt option never worked correctly.  Every time I sat, stood, walked, stopped, or just merely breathed, the phone would pop out of the backing and fall to the ground, which completely defeats the purpose of a cover.  After two weeks of trying to fight with it (even considered gluing my new phone to the cover), I put the other plug in and now just put it in my pocket, which smears and scratches the screen since there is no protection for the touchscreen.  I would not recommend this cover.

* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages "as they were meant to be".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.

3307	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Okay, before I get into this.  I have to let everyone know that this is the first flip phone I've ever owned.  All of my previous phones were candybar style Nokias.  The KRZR is an excellent phone, still a little pricy, but beautiful to behold.  The MP3 player function is quite good.  The volume and clarity for such a small object are top notch.  Colors are bright and vibrant.  I think my favorite feature of all of them is the voice command function.  That in itself made it worthy of a five star rating.  I have only one complaint.  The menus can be quite complex and detail intensive at times.  The manual deffinitely came in handy a couple of times.  But otherwise this thing is worth its weight in gold.
5068	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I just got this phone as a replacement for my Curve 8300.  Boy, was I impressed.  It runs fast, keeps up with my typing & you can do most anything on this phone.  Email set up is a breeze & I love using the custom ringtones for people in my address book.  You can easily create your own wallpaper & songs for it and upload without confusion.
Works ok, but only a 3 hardness.
So now all I needed to enjoy music from my phone was a USB cable to connect my Nokia to my old Compaq computer(the computer upgrade would come only recently).
I really expected this to last at least half as long than the $40 BlueAnt that I bought five years ago.
8067	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I have been using the Jabra for about 3 months, in anticipation of the California hands-free law. While I like the slim, sleek design, I would prefer a couple of big buttons instead of the single one. It took me a while to learn the difference between the "press" and the "tap", so I was transferring calls to the handset when I meant to hang up. And I never did get the right pressure for answering. I rigged my phone to have the Jabra answer automatically after two rings -- MUCH better and much safer!

2712	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I've been a Treo user since the Treo 90 and have owned all the Treos except the 700.  Recently (yesterday) I switched to T-Mobile having acquired a BlackBerry 8100 Pearl from Amazon and I am completely satisfied.  I switched carriers because my Sprint service in Tucson was poor at best & even-though they would fix it after spending 45 minutes on the phone (conservative estimate); the fix only lasted a week or two & then back to constantly dropped calls.
Setup is a breeze and it is on most of this type of devices.
6468	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Junk!
6686	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Finally got the signal booster installed!! Wow, we finally have a 3G signal downstairs, it works great and since the house faces East and the AT&T tower is East, we had no problems after mounting on our house, I am very happy! I would recommend this product as long as you have a 3G signal in your yard.

This site is also where you register and enter your credit card information.
6792	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great batteries.
I haven't put the "wind cancellation" to the test yet but I will and then I'll update this review. But, honestly, when I saw all the positive reviews here on Amazon (1200 or so?) and many of them Treo 650 users, I figured it was a fairly safe bet and I'm very satisfied with the purchase so far.
3963	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	I bought this speaker phone about 3 months ago. I used this speakerphone successfully with the original Motorola Razor and now the iPhone 3G. If you don't want to read my detailed review, then just read the short Pros and Cons section.
9015	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I really like my Trent, it works great , the only thing is that the button ON/OFF doesn't work sometimes, but other than that, it is a great device, just do not work for Ipad.
All in all, I highly recommend it, for music playback primarily (in a car that lacks built-in BT obviously). For having long convos thru the built-in mic, not so much.
quality is so much better with the Nokia.


2402	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	The headset volume, size, comfort and ease of wearing is wonderful, the weakest feature of this headset is the ear loop. The connection to the headset broke within a week of ownership. However the replacement piece is designed much better and is easily available. Great headset for the money.
516	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	Great replacement battery, once fully charge the phone worked for two full days with regular calls.
2620	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	2.0	I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!
When I'm at work and at home my phone is always charged.  But when I'm out and about - that's when it's always draining on me.  This happens most often when I'm bored, as mentioned above.  For example: boring church, long flights, waiting for the concert to start (they ALWAYS are late), boring conferences, or everyone's favorite, boring meetings.  I even use this thing when I'm camping.  Concerts are a big one though.  I like to get there early and get a good seat.  And then I hit my phone to pass the time.  Then the show starts, and I want to snap a pic. D'oh!  The phone's dead.  Murphy's Law dictates that that's EXACTLY when I miss a call, too.  Solution: all I have to do is plug into the iTorch, and I've got plenty of juice in 20-30 minutes. This thing will get your iPhone fully charged in just over an hour.  And the lithium ion battery means you can charge it over and over again without having to fully deplete it and risk the life of the battery.

I did find and order the correct battery.  All is good
4178	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	4.0	First off... this is the BEST Bluetooth headset I have ever owned (works great with my Apple iPhone)!!!  However, I did have a few quality issues that I would like to share:
On a side note, I can see some users expecting the charging cord to be a little longer than it is. Most likely those users will be the ones who do not have an easy access to a usb port, PC for example, and will try to plug it into a wall outlet, which majority of the time will require a longer cord. Also an optional wall adapter would be nice for those listed previously.
Design & Comfort is GREAT
9744	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	cheap price for batteries. Perfect fit

The seller even tried to get to recall this negative comment and promised a refund.  NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND.
Thanks for reading my first product review. Hope to do many more.
If you really need a multi-fuction business oriented smartphone you're very likely going to need email access, a somewhat larger screen (larger than what you get on a regular cell), a qwerty keyboard, and reception that compares to a good cell phone.
3. Sound
4135	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I just got my jawbone today but before I start to use it, I am already unsatisfied with following reasons:
Test#2 charged 49% on an IPAD 1

My only draw back was they don't last that long. About every six months to a year, we would have to buy another. They would quite working in one way or another.
3352	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	Exactly as described.  Worked out of the Box and met my expectations.  Would recommend to friends and family for sure.

Hope this was helpful.  Do your research, Peeps!
- Depending on how much it would increase the overall size, a higher capacity would be nice. Currently, it will boost my iPad mini 80% of its total battery life, which is plenty to last a day. I am however extremely happy with the size and I would prefer not to change that very much for more battery life.
Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try.  The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear.  The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.
5.  Camera: It's not the best resolution but would work if you are not looking to make a photography career by using the camera on this phone.
302	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	This is an Awesome product! I went from worrying early on the day  (around noon ) about where I could plug the phone to charge it while using it at the same time, to not needing to do it at all until I got home to charge it overnight!!!

7814	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	works as advertised
All in all, a very handy product, priced the way it should be.  The only drawback is that it will periodically come loose from the windshield--you just have to make sure to wet the suction cup thoroughly.  But if you have a clean, smooth, flat place on your dash, it would work better by not hanging upside down.
8218	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	NEG	1.0	I purchased a white cozip from this company that came wi a front and back cover.  So I thought , heck I'll get a silver and red one too.  The red one was exactly like the white, front and back cover.  The silver one came wi only a bk cover.  This company orig had pics posted that only showed the bk of the cover. First they sent me the wrong silver case then sent the half silver case.  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!  They've since put up pic of the front to show u that the case only protects the bk of the iphone.  Great if u only drop yr phone on its back!!!!
3871	Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5	POS	5.0	I have been using this shower head as my daily driver for almost a year.  Amazing, simple to clean, and does not leak.  Be gentle when setting up, it is plastic.  I didn't have issues with it cracking, but I had read enough of others people's reviews to know to be careful.
