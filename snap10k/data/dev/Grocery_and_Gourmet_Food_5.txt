4671	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	After reading other reviews on this mayo, I had to give it a try.  I grew up on Hellman's mayo, and as another review observed, you will probably prefer what you are used to.  Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor, I can't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste.  I want to try making some deviled eggs with it, I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor.  I also tried Duke's mayo, which is a lot like Hellman's, only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor.  I'm glad I tried both of these, I expect I will use up the Dukes, not sure about the Kewpie mayo.  It recommends using within one month after opening.  But ultimately, I think I'll end up staying with what I am used to, which is Hellman's.

The smell of the Espressione pods (regular and decaf) when opened is incredible - dark, rich roasts.  FYI - the pods are produced in Italy, which is a good sign.  Also, each pod has a handy paper "tab" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a "best if used by" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.

You can freeze half, and keep the other half in a mason jar in the fridge. :) Each packet of the individual yeast contains 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast, so all you do is scoop out that much when you're making a recipe that calls for a packet.

As far as I'm concerned, this product should either come with a warning that it's not heart healthy or be taken off the market entirely.  I'm sure I can come up with practically the same taste without adding the junk.  Don't know if it's worth bothering to send back but I sure won't be using it.

I normally buy the large flakes at the co-op, but the convenience of buying it on amazon and having it sent to my house cannot be beat! I am not sure if I like the large or small flakes best. I feel the smaller (these) flakes will be amazing for folding into un-meat-balls or sprinkling on vegan pizza or popcorn for sure.

I have been using it solely on desserts thus far and I works so well with my salted caramel chocolate torte. A sprinkle on top of the chocolate top makes a world of difference. It did not dissolve or get watery the way regular salt or even other sea salts would have. It stayed crunchy and whole to the end. You cannot go wrong with this salt.

6507	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I bought this tea from a store - so I am only reviewing the product/taste. It's incredible and amazing. Absolutely incredible. It is very "sweet". The spices make this actually taste very sweet (but not overly sweet). It truly tastes like chai (sweetened chai). I Love a really creamy chai tea so I use either half and half or whipping cream (1-2 tbsp) with a 8 oz of this tea (1 bag, 8 oz hot water, 5-7 min seep). I love how I don't need to add sweetener/sugar. It's great by itself as well. I'm doing this intermittent fasting and I crave food and sweet food at night. I just bought a box of this yesterday and between my mother and I, we've already finished half the box. I can drink this and sleep with no issue because it's caffeine free. I'm so incredibly happy with this tea, I cannot even describe. The store I got it from was a bit cheaper than here - I will probably be buying 2 boxes of this tea a week. It's literally my favorite tea right now.
2697	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	2.0	2nd bag I've purchased. I normally just throw a handful into my shake but today I popped a few in my mouth and immediately noticed a very rancid taste.

7115	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	My husband is a vegetarian and I love Better Than Bouillon's No Chicken Chicken base.  I grabbed one of these to mix it up.  Found a recipe for the best cream of mushroom soup that you can make vegetarian or vegan.  Start off with olive oil, scallions and chopped baby Bella mushrooms.  I add no chicken chicken stock and use almond milk and corn starch--if heading the vegan way, or use light cream with corn starch to thicken up.  I add the mushroom bouillon to kick up the taste and the richness it gives to the soup is devine.  I make mushroom gravy or sauce and add a bit in.  A little bit goes a long way and refrain from using too much salt before you add the stock.  It lasts in the fridge and, believe it or not, the kids are digging the soup.  They would not eat a mushroom if i put a sauted one right in front of them on a plate.

I don't know why anyone would recommend this icing except for last minute ease of use if you did not have time make your own.  It is super sweet and ridiculously stiff, which serves its purpose if thats what your looking for.  However, many of the Wilson tips (a large range of sizes) that we used in class were too small to properly push the icing out without tremendous force.  I had difficulty.  It was impossible for my eight year old.  The icing seemed suited only for the 2 largest tips.  My classmates were inquiring about a more "workable" icing than this.  We were told to Youtube it since better icing exists.  I guess for something quick and cheap (if purchased elsewhere), it was ok.  For 10 bucks, no way!!

I got used to it after a few years and got to where regular coffee seemed weak. Then I quit traveling to New Orleans and started drinking coffee without chickory. I was just fine, until  few weeks ago we went to New Orleans and I stopped at the cafe Du Monde for coffee. Got back on the chickory "kick" once again and brought home a can of their chickory flavored coffee. We personally like he taste and my wife thinks it is too strong. It is very good coffee and if one is looking for an instant dramatic change to what they have been drinking they should sip on a few cups of this coffee. You will certainly noticed instantly the change and you might even prefer it over the regular coffee.

I've always heard that if you warm up on the inside, then the outside will follow. So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm. When I was done shoveling and still shivering, I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.
3894	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for -- but it is expensive here. I have found achiote paste at a local Mexican grocery for much less. However, when I was first looking for this, I was glad to find it at Amazon, and willing to pay the extra.  It's the real deal. There is no other flavor like this. For those who have never used this, it comes in a very firm block, and you must break off pieces to mix with oil and/or lime juice to use for a marinade. Blending with those ingredients in a small food processor makes it easier to mix.  I only used about 1/3 to 1/2 of a block for a whole chicken. But I'm a novice with this, and still learning, so listen to tips from others who know more than I do.
9862	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This was so great! I loved it. Everyone said my sweetbread and my cinnamon buns were better than ever! I will use this product from now on every time I do baking!

5563	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I always enjoy the product.  Unfortunately, sometimes it is not shipped in the proper packaging.  This time it was shipped without the caps tightened.  That is pretty messy.  As I said, I am always pleased with the product despite the other problems.  Thanks

UPDATE:  I just received another order on May 12, 2017 and I must say there was no way I was going to keep them.  They were "dirty" with all kinds of fuzzy/cobwebby looking things on them and many were molded.  I have purchased these many times, and this is the first that this has happened.  It could just be a fluke, but I am hesitant to buy again right now.
2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.

I offered numerous different teas to my guests until someone gave me a box of Celestial Seasons Black Cherry Berry.  Guests raved about this tea.  Some of my guests drink it hot, other prefer it cold, but everyone likes it.  After some months of constant praise for this tea, I decided to make this my tea of choice when entertaining.  Now when I entertain I make several  pots of Black Cherry Berry and everyone is happy.

I like the coloring and the flavor, how quickly it brews either weak or strong, that choice is yours. The tea is so easy to make, a child can make their own glass without supervision. I recommend this flavor for a change of pace from your regular sweet tea. I like mine sweetened with agave, sugar works just fine too. Everybody that drinks this in my home likes it and always request more. I would give it more stars if I could, this is how much we like it.

A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.

But first get you're sleep straightened out. If you are having sleep problems, Dr. Ross, author of the Mood Cure suggests taking 5HTP for serotonin/ melatonin production, and then if that doesn't work GABA, and then if that doesn't work she says your cortisol levels are too high at night and you need an adaptogen. Other hormonal imbalances are a sign of cortisol imbalance, since the hormones are all connected and can rob you of cortisol. A sign of elevated cortisol levels is waking up at 3am. Cortisol can be spiked by low-blood sugar at 3am and this is prevented by eating carbs and good fats before bed. If you still have problems, and I did, then cortisol can be balanced with Ashwagandha taken just before bed. I have been taking Ashwagandha for a few weeks now and am getting to sleep right away and sleeping through the night... finally after a couple of years struggling with that.

The first cup I made, I sweetened it with stevia like I normally do, and quickly realized I had overdone it.  This tea has a natural sweetness to it already.  Just like many reviews say, this tea is heavier on the spice than the apple flavor, but with a little experimenting, I have found that a little lemon and honey helps add a little fruity flavor to it while keeping it nice and sweet.  The price here is about the same as it costs at the store, so it's really a matter of convenience and whether or not you want to buy six boxes at a time.

7616	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I love coffee, even decaf - but like many, need to cut WAY back for health reasons (reflux, gastritis).  Years ago, I drank and enjoyed Postum, a powdered grain-based product that you stir into hot water like instant coffee. It was very good, as long as you don't try to think of it as "almost coffee."  Instead, it is a hot brown liquid with a pleasant taste that gives you much of the satisfaction of coffee, without all the acid or caffeine.  Postum was discontinued a few years ago, and instead I have use "Kaffree Roma" toasted grain instant beverage and "Cafix" - each containing roasted barley and chicory, and both available on Amazon. Both are very good - better than Postum - but clearly not coffee. I stumbled on Roastaroma in a grocery store and decided to give it a try.  Drinking my very first cup now - I made a big 10 oz mug with one bag. I like strong coffee, and this is pretty robust. And more coffee-like than any of the powdered beverages I mentioned. You do get the nice overtones of the carob, cinnamon, allspice, and star anise, but they stay in the background.  Really delicious stuff.  I drink my coffee black and this "tea" needs no sugar or creamer for my taste. Quite remarkable, I am certainly going to buy more. I paid $2.99 for a box of 20 bags.

In terms of strength it's nice and bold.  The vanilla smoothes everything out though...it's not too strong, unless you let the bag steep for an inordinately long time.  But Bengal Spice does have one notable weakness....for those looking for a great chai, you might be disappointed.  Because while it's strong and has a nice flavor, the ginger, cardamom, nutmeg etc. is hardly noticeable, masked by the strength of the cinnamon.  It's a shame, because this blend is definitely better-tasting than some, such as Yogi's classic India Spice.  If the other "chai spices" in this blend had been stronger, this would be a 5-star tea.

7277	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea is great. Each flavor is in a closed pouch inside the box. So far, the only flavor I've tried is peppermint and it is so good! I'm having a cup as I write this review. One tea bag works wonderfully for a cup of tea, where some other brands need 2 tea bags in order to be flavorful. The peppermint flavor is minty, but not too minty. With a pinch of sugar, its like drinking a candy cane. I'll try the other flavors at a later date, but if they are anywhere as flavorful or delicious as the peppermint, I know I'll love them. It came so fast. I've never seen these sampler boxes in my grocery stores, but regular boxes are more expensive than this box was. Plus I didn't even have to leave my home to get it. Really great product, I definitely will be buying this again.

 Use with soy milk usually.  it is naturally sweet and spicy no need for any sweeterner!  Like it better than Chai now, which i use to add honey to.
For the last five years or so, I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot. The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much. It is particularly helpful to quiet those who cannot refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events. Invariably, for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally. The only downside is this ploy only works once.
8062	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Nothing says, "Happy holidays," to me quite like homemade fruit cake or a cup of hot Sugar Plum Spice tea. I look forward to this Celestial Seasonings specialty every year, as it is normally available only from October to January. The roasted barley malt, chicory root and carob give it a rich, robust flavor--almost like a cup of mocha. Rose hips, natural plum flavor and chamomile flowers add a sweet, fruity taste akin to a fine plum pudding. Ginger root gives it that characteristic holiday zing. Try this full-flavored herbal infusion yourself, and your taste buds will dance with delight!
6481	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	What a treat!  Sweet and spicy and sugar free. Total winner! Have put this on auto-ship.
Very good at throat soothing without all the un natural medicine taste of so many other cough drops. Made in Switzerland of all natural ingredients. Same formula for over seventy five years.
~The Rebecca Review
Add a little jasmine tea or other flavoring. Most pre-flavored teas are too strong flavoring.
Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.

5728	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I didn't think Id love this creamy solid honey as much as the more familiar liquid amber honey, but it really does taste delicious. Its great on toast, and because its solid it makes a fantastic sweetener for fruit and nut or granola bars. If you use syrup to make granola bars you have to make sure to boil it to the point where it will crystallize when it cools down but this honey is naturally solid at room temperature, so you just have to warm it up enough to make it liquid, mix with your fruit and nuts, pack it down into a backing sheet or tin, and then refrigerate for a few hours to solidify before you cut it into bars. Because the honey is sweeter, you also need less of it compared to sugar or brown rice syrup (around half a cup honey to 4 cups of fruit/nuts/grains/seeds).

Kewpie, though the ingredients are similar, has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture, making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods.

Each has their own good points.  This one is better for being calm and still feeling like I can focus.  RoT's is better for weekends or after work, I think.  Not as strong as a tea I have called, "Lavender Butterfly" from The English Tea Store though.  Different strokes for different scenarios though. I'll keep ordering this for the workday.
2733	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I completely disagree with P. Laird's review.  I also bought my Tea at Big Y and wish they sold Pumpkin Tea year around. This tea is my favorite.  I don't have any after taste with Stevia.  We all have different tastes with foods and drinks. I have done a lot of research with sweeteners and was surprised with what I found.  Stevia is from a plant from South America and is natural and not altered in any way. To my surprise, Sucralose (splenda)is sugar that has been treated with chlorine ! Yikes !  That is not good. The chlorine will kill the good bacteria in your intestines and cause bloating and make you feel more hungry. Sucralose is used in most diet drinks and has not been around for long enough to know how safe it is.  I am done with Sucralose and now buying soda with Stevia, like Zevia and the Steaz Tea, because they use the plant Stevia. Please don't take my word for Sucralose not being healthy for you, you need to research all the sweeteners for yourself and decide what is best for you and your family.  I won't drink anything with High Frutcose Sugar, but pure cane sugar is fine as long as too many calories is not an issue. I read other reviews on this Sweet Pumpkin Tea and they were all good, this was the only review that was that low.  Love this Tea.
Here's the secret:  SAF-Instant Yeast!  A 16-ounce will last for all the home baking most people will do for months, or perhaps years.  It is supposed to last one year, but it can  easily last 5-10 years, according to a number of sources.  It is to be stored in a cool dry place.

It's bold - very heavy on the cinnamon and very fruity - and tastes best when it's brewed a little weak (I'm someone who normally likes very strong tea and this is too strong even for me). But wow does it smell good! I like to put several tea bags in a coffee machine and brew a big pot and then leave the top part containing the wet filter sitting out on the counter for a few hours like potpourri, and the house smells wonderful.

I usually use various flavored herbal tea bags, sometimes throwing in a few of these too, always sweetening with healthy, no-sugar stevia added to the whole pitcher. When we were caught without our daily gallon, I decided to make this "straight," since it brews quickly. Turns out my husband and son love this by itself!

The tea tastes like chamomile with a strong, delicious lavender taste. It is a very fresh taste because there are no flavorings and everything is organic. The smell is yummy, too, even before brewing, as the lavender smell stands out; you could put the tea bags in your drawers to use as sachet fresheners!

Update: I have now gone through two containers of this fine salt, still love using it, and would add one practical cook's point: the grains are so large that you can actually feel how many you are adding to a dish -- it doesn't take many. But I tried a few pinches and was amazed to see how quickly I learned how to "feel" ten grains -- about ten times and my range is between 8 and 12 over 90% of the time. Amazing -- great fun and great taste.
Pu-erhs are "double-fermented".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.

With anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties, chamomile can be helpful for easing stomach and intestinal cramps.

Anyway, its time for me to place my verdict. The taste is absolutely yummy. I can eat a dozen of these while watching my favorite television show but in terms of its energy boosting effects, I have to rethink again. It must be due to the sugar included in its ingredients but I did not feel any boosting effect at all. Unlike what my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements does for me. I am one of the few fortunate ones who is suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I sleep long hours yet feel tired and eat more yet feel hungry.

This is a good replacement.  I sort of like this taste as well as chocolate?  Better for you?  Really really good to eat.  Always seem to need more.  Sort of a malted milk taste.  Love them!
Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use "natural flavors" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called "effervescent decaffeination" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.
7896	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	This tea has an excellent taste. I am also a fan of Celestial's apple cinnamon, but I've come to prefer this one. I use it with the Bigelow organic green tea (2 X 2 bags). Unfortunately, this is not an organic product. I do worry about what gets distilled out; if there was anything bad in the leaves, I imagine that steeping would bring the bad stuff right into the cup. But, it's all about risk management.

3496	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	I was hoping this coffee had a sweetness to it......however, it is sort of on the bitter side. A darker roast, I would say.  It's okay.....but, I doubt I would buy it again.
I haven't tried others so I can't direct you to any other types of food markers. But my guess is that there are others out there that do a better job. If you had a small job these would be fine. If you had to write a lot, it will not do a good job. It certainly won't live up to the picture on the cover of the box. This shows a pen making a pretty butterfly in one long swoopy line. That is simply not going to happen with these.

5. Protein in brewer's yeast just like in any greens is incomplete, missing few amino acids. Only quinoa and soy are complete but soy has estrogen and processed where quinoa is not. I never count on any protein from any source other than pure isolate without any additives or small canned fish. I consume cooked quinoa with my meals but regardless I consume raw ground quinoa+sesame+flax+hemp with cocoa+organic soy milk on daily basis.

However, from my 20+ years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee's I've tasted, THIS one reigns supreme.  And it better for that price!  But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.
800	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Good stuff.  Healthy, tasty, and best of all...organic, which is the reason I bought it.  I can get multi grain cereal at my local health food store but many times not organic.  Easy to order on line and probably a little less expensive for the larger quantities.  Lately I have been mixing it with a little Kaniwa, which my local Sprouts had on sale, and the combo is also good, and makes it 7 grain instead of 6.
This is organic, is a root that thickens, can be used to dust chicken or fish to seal in the juices and is just healthier.
The bottle reminds me of a pocket flask and like a turn of the century

Was thrilled to find this product!  (One suggestion to the seller is to include basic recipe instructions.)  I did some research, and it takes about 1&1/3 cups macaroni and 1/4-1/3 cup of the powder, (plus 2 T. butter and 1/4 cup milk) to be equal to a box of Kraft.  You can jazz it up a bit by adding a few dashed of parmesan or some grated cheddar.  Maybe a little garlic and a few dashed of Tabasco, if you like it spicy.  I searched the web and found lots of tips.  This is also good sprinkled on popcorn!

If you don't like the idea of cold-brewing, but like the convenience of water bottles, you could try what I do once a week. I boil 4-6 quarts of water and steep as many teabags as I want, making sure to at least meet the minimum requirement. Then I pour it into the water bottles I used during the week, and my Nalgene bottle. I have a stock of ready-made tea handy in the fridge, to drink cold or pour in a mug and microwave!

2077	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Of all the Earl Grey's I've tried, this and Rishi's version are the most robust.  If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Rishi are your Earl Greys of choice.  Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.
9665	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	4.0	Great tea.  Delicious chocolate fix in the morning, and helps greatly with mental clarity in place of coffee.  Brews a little weak, so if your mug is big, let steep a little longer or use two bags.  Water needs to be hot, but just short of boiling.  It doesn't steep well in boiling water.

She said it arrived in a huge box, but it was just a little tree and it looked perfect.  They had packed it so well.

2756	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I'm a huge tea drinker. Every day, a few cups at least. Normally however, all I drink is straight black tea. I find I like the IDEA of flavored teas but they rarely live up to the scent they have. This one however is a great exception to the rule. I've been drinking it for years but can no longer find it any stores near me so I was thrilled to find it in Amazon. This has become my bedtime cup. I love that it's decaf yet doesn't have that strange decaf flavor (the same one that coffee drinkers say decaf coffee has). It has a wonderful spicy/coconutty (yes, that is now a word :-P ) scent and the flavor matches the smell. There is no "bite" to this which some Chai blends can have. The spices are there but not all "in your face". The coconut flavor is mild but definitely present. My favorite way to drink this is with a splash (ok, a big splash) of Coffee Mate Coconut Creamer. It brings out the flavor and has the side benefit of bringing the tea down to immediate drinking temp lol. All in all, this is a very soothing, very comforting tea, great to wind down with at the end of the day.

I don't use butter when cooking them in the small amount of oil, just is not needed!  a taste experience you should try.  some use coconut oil, but lends a very coconut taste which i did not care for in popcorn.  season as desired, I simply sprinkle sea salt on.

All my life I've craved savory flavors and have been drawn to foods such as red meat (preferably scorched on the outside), tomatoes, mushrooms, and dark green vegetables - I'll take one saltine cracker over a  handful of cookies any day of the week.  Well, come to find out, Marmite is high in the "fifth flavor" umami, and that's what I'm always trying to find in my food.  It's "that flavor I'm looking for" distilled down into a little brown jar.  Mind you, it's strong stuff; a little dab will satisfy all your red meat cravings (though it contains not one spec of any animal product) but more than a dab is really just 'way too strong, even for a savory-food-lover like me.  Spread it THIN!  It's great spread nearly transparently over toast or crackers, and a couple of drops will make any insipid canned broth lot more hearty.

This tea is the only caffeine-free tea that can come anywhere close to passing for real tea.  It's not as wonderful as real tea, but compared to the herbal drek that most people consume, it's heaven.  It's an herbal formulation, but it contains "tea essence" as an ingredient.  I let it steep a long time.  Sometimes I put in a splash of milk or cream.  I take the bags with me on trips.  It's not so easy to find, and I've always snatched up all the boxes I could get my hands on (when I could find it in Whole Foods, for example), so buying it in bulk on Amazon is great!

Will definitely purchase again, but not for use at the bar.
As you may know, licorice root is supposed to help those with asthma.

My husband enjoys unsweetened iced tea and hot traditional teas unsweetened and he felt this unsweetened iced passion tea was too "sweet" and "flowery". My sons didn't like it as they are used to plain water (which is 99% of what my husband and I allow them to drink) or having their flavored drinks even more dense such as pure fruit juices or artificially flavored drinks or having sugar-filled sodas.

Later I ate a few more - wondering if it was a fluke - the same experience.  I was so disappointed since the other almonds were so good.  It is too late to return them.

This is tactile, and more fun than I'd like to admit to pinch and grind between your fingers onto your food. I wouldn't recommend a grinder, it's too fine for that. It arrives in a plastic bag contained in a rather flimsy outer branded cardboard box (that is NOT the shipping box- just the product itself) so you will need something to store it in. A non-metal, non-plastic salt cellar is the thing for everyday use.

Morning Thunder Tea is based on the South American Mate that is drunk in a way that is not easily understood in North America. With regular Mate (I am NOT now describing this product and how it is used as Morning Thunder comes in a regular tea bag) you pour hot water over the unbagged "tea" mix in a gourd cup and then sip the "tea" through a silver straw that has a strainer at the end and you keep adding hot water to the cup for a long time. The "tea" mixture is not used up and can make quite a bit of tea over and over from the same teaspoonful of "tea."

When purchasing a bottle, avoid the artificial versions as they they tend to have a weaker, often tinny aftertaste. Splurge for the real stuff here....worth every penny.

Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation. It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that's why it looks "cleaner" and smoother. But, when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas, yeast and enzymes (that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system) are partially destroyed. For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.

This time will vary with different machines.
There is much discussion on artificial sweeteners.  We have aspartame, sucralose, and stevia.  We need to use the one that doesn't give us negative side effects.  I researched them all and found that stevia is from a plant in  South America, and I have no side effects from it and I prefer this to the much used sucralose, because it gave me muscle cramps in my foot and nerve pain.  When I don't use sucralose, I don't have any of those problems.  I have tested this many times.  I have no health problems, I don't drink, smoke, and I am not overweight.  I looked up sucralose and it is treat with chlorine that can reduce the good bacteria in the intestines and cause bloating.  I just use stevia now. Some say aspartame can cause brain tumors with too much use, so I don't drink that often.  Please google the Dr. Mercola story about sucralose (splenda).  That story solved my problem.

For starters, it isn't too sweet. Secondly, it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor.  Plus, the blurb on the side of the box is right.  Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion, and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it.  [Or is this purely psychological?]  It's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat, but don't want to feel guilty afterwards.  It's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach, or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days!
This sauce has a nice bold flavor ,but honestly It is not nearly as hot as I was expecting.

She was bent over the sink washing her mouth out and getting very hot. She had to take her jacket off. She had been drinking hours earlier, so that might be why she was so stupid to try it. But eventually she must of drank too much because she started vomiting. I don't think the hot sauce made her sick. She vomited a couple hours later after drinking more wine. Thankfully her boyfriend was very caring of her and made sure she was ok. Sadly the person this sauce was meant for, was able to tolerate it.

My experience is that, if you plan to store your baked goods for more than a couple of days, the color does start to bleed out (while I hadn't opened this assortment, I had a different Wilton assortment with similar ingredients that I'd experienced this with), especially with light-colored frostings.

The taste is great: a very strong Jalapeno taste with hints of garlic and some other spice(s). Unlike some (many?) hot sauces, which are all heat and little or no flavor, this one is all about the strong flavor. You can really, really taste those Jalapenos, and it goes fantastically well on things that benefit from an intense Jalapeno taste - eggs, chips, etc.  This sauce is *extremely* mild, and by mild, I mean it has almost no heat. It has turned out to be the perfect sauce to offer family and friends who don't like hot foods. The heat is so mild in this sauce that it's really more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. But that's OK - the flavor is superb; it stands on its own even without heat. It's just that if you want some heat, you'll have to add a real hot sauce to whatever food you're putting this on.

2963	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I got these for a friend who likes spicy foods. I knew I couldn't just get some ordinary hot sauce and so based off the reviews, ordered a bottle of this. He told me that it was so hot, it ruined some of the foods he put it on. Yes! Exactly what I was hoping for haha. I would recommend the company put a smaller spout on this bottle, it really needs something closer to an eye dropper!
I tried this tea plain--I didn't use any added sweetener.  Maybe I would have like it better if I had.  In the future, I think that I'll stick with run of the mill chamomile tea, even though this tea is certainly very pleasant.
I love that the tea bags are unbleached.  Also, with this tea (like with most Celestial Seasonings teas I've tried), there's no powder that comes out of the bags -- the bags are a fine enough mesh to catch everything.

It is important for you to know that our product does contain some MSG.  Although we do not add any MSG to our Better that Bouillon line of products, they naturally contain MSG from the ingredients we use.  MSG comes from the common amino acid glutamic acid, and glutamic acid is naturally present in our bodies, as well as in many foods and food additives.  Since glutamic acid is naturally occurring in all protein, I am not aware of a chicken broth or base that does not contain at least some natural MSG.  Of course, as you can see on our label, we do not add any additional MSG to our products.

6700	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	Do not confuse this "Blueberry Tea" with the previous formulation!  There is no similarity.  Up to quite recently, this brand had a box with blueberries portrayed on the right side: This tea was easily worth 5 stars, and it was a staple of mine for several years.  Last month, I ordered five boxes of this tea [from a different site which portrayed the original box], but only one of the boxes had this design.  The other four had a river-running bear with a Disneylike background.  The tea "blend" was appalling!  Although there was scant uniformity between the colour/flavour of the various packets, not one of the 6 packets so far used has even remotely approached the previous formulation in taste.  Two of the six were poured down the sink after the first sip.  The rest were rather reluctantly drunk, but none warranted a second steeping, unlike their predecessor.
Free shipping makes this a cheap price.

Yet, I'm not a big fan of the Habanero chile but you may be. El Yucateco also produces an excellent Chipotle and Jalapeo hot sauce. I prefer both sauces/chiles to the Habanero. What I can say is El Yucateco makes some great sauces - often true to the chile they feature.

Now that I've used this up, I don't think I'll repurchase.  The quality is great, but raw honey is so difficult to use in the Pac. NW (especially in winter) as it hardens.

The sauce has a very nice flavor, unlike any other sauce I have tried.  I would say it kind of has a bit of a mustard taste with Habanero.  I did not find it too hot to eat, and my colon is still intact.  I think it has too strong of a flavor to use in recipes, but it might go well on your morning sausages or potatoes.  Definitely worth a try, but not in my top ten hot sauces.  Update:  I tried this on Morningstar Veggie Patties (e.g. vegetarian breakfast sausage) and it is fantastic for breakfast!

_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this Bonsai to a friend. I am purchasing a humidity tray separately as this is a tropical plant and needs high humidity to thrive. The instructions are fairly basic but a quick search of Fukien Tea will yield many useful results. I am more the 100% satisfied with this plant. It looks beautiful, pest and disease free, and even unboxing was exciting. This Bonsai really is healthy and has at least as many leaves as in the pictures. This is NOT just a sad cutting; this Fukien Tea is a strong Bonsai ready for care. 5 Stars Easy!

I tried this salt for the first time this morning on my poached eggs. Suddenly, I understand why, long ago, salt was so valuable it was used as currency. Yes, it was a clean, clear taste, without any off-flavors. But, I expected that. What I didn't expect was the effect of the triangular crystals.  They stick to the food much like the flakes, without falling off like the old-fashioned, iodine-laden crystalline cubes we all grew up with (if you have some of those still lying around, just toss them - they really aren't worth eating). But, why are they better than the Kosher flakes? Because they crunch in your mouth when you eat them. It is an almost surreal experience. I found myself looking forward to each bite, because every time I bit down, there was a satisfying soft crunch, along with a tiny little explosion of salt taste in my mouth. This salt is just fantastic! So much so that I set aside some time this evening to write a review to let people know.
5806	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I know nothing about honey except that this tastes great. It was very well packaged, each jar in its own sturdy cardboard box. The jars are glass and the top is metal. I am not so much one to tout popular remedies for real or imagined ills, I have to say that I have had very little problem with my sinuses since using this honey. Normally I am racked with "nasal" allergies. Since this is not exactly "local" honey I'm not sure how that works but I am feeling a bit less like an allergy victim now that I am enjoying this honey. Even without this possible benefit, the stuff just tastes wonderful so that is good enough for me. I'm hooked.

I managed to hold on to my job thanks to the Gene Eden VIR 101 product which was given to me by my friend in the US. He himself is using it to combat latent chronic viral infection which results to lesser efficacy of the body's immune system.

I go though phases of baking a lot, then not at all, but there's tons of yeast for your dollar, here.  It's a very consistent product, too.  It seems to have a much broader tolerance for temperature ranges, so that I don't need to be overly concerned with the exact temperature of the liquids I add it to, nor the temperature of the place I let my dough rise.

9541	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	Some in my family are allergic to various artificial food colors, but my kids really didn't want a white birthday cake cause it is boring.  Beet powder is the perfect coloring for us.  I simply mix it with a small amount of hot water, let it sit a minute, then strain through cheesecloth.  I then use the liquid in making my frosting and it is a beautiful bright pink color--prettier than standard food coloring IMO, and a perfect color for little girls' birthdays.  I have also just added the powder directly to the frosting, which works but it takes a while for the color to appear full strenth and if you look closly you will see tiny dots of beet powder.

4400	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	NEG	1.0	I disagree that Wilton is easy to roll out - perhaps that was on an extremely hot day in a very humid house?! I can't tell you how crappy this fondant is to work with. it is so stiff. My husband and I tried it several times (thinking maybe at first we just got a bad box) we both sat with half the box each and worked it until our hands were sore to get it vaguely softened. Then I tried to roll  it out, it was so stiff I was using my whole body weight to roll it. My husband rolled it out with difficulty. By the time you've managed to roll it thin enough (all that effort takes time) it has dried out and cracks as it folds over the cake. Terrible fondant. SATIN ICE is much much better, more pliable, easier to roll out and much nicer flavor. Wilton flavor is kinda ok, it's not discusting like some say but SATIN ICE is so much nicer and also comes in many different flavors like vanilla or buttercream - even chocolate! whereas Wilton comes in one fake flavor. Stay away from Wilton!!!!

Eleuthero has been shown to enhance mental acuity and physical endurance without the letdown that comes with caffeinated products. Research has shown that eleuthero improves the use of oxygen by the exercising muscle. This means that a person is able to maintain aerobic exercise longer and recover from workouts more quickly. Preliminary research from Russia indicates it may be effective for this purpose. Other trials have been inconclusive or have shown no beneficial effect.

I threw four bags into a quart of water and indeed, in five or six minutes, I had a pale, peachy brew. It tasted a bit weak--perhaps I needed more time or more bags, so I'm going to try steeping (with room temperature water) for ten minutes and see how it goes. Meanwhile, the tea, although weaker than I'd prefer, is very good and the peach flavor is very natural and I like it a lot. I did not need to add sweetener, but a few drops of stevia or some fruit syrup could work fine. I think it's good just as it is. It's very thirst-quenching and zero calorie, and I'm enjoying it on a hot summer day.

2086	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	This tea scores high on all counts--fragrance, flavor and even the name! Making tea with Lotus creates a delicate light green brew which is deliciously scented. The flavor is augmented by the aroma--a light floral flavor with just a hint of the grassines of green tea. The unusual taste of lotus flower is hard to describe--it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea.

Overall, this was a great purchase.  You get two boxes, each of which has 14 pieces.  So, aside from just the sheer quantity of gum, I like that I have several layers of plastic wrap protecting the packs of gum.  Seriously.  I live in a climate that gets very hot and humid during the summer, and if my gum isn't protected, it gets all mushy and loses its flavor.  It gets ruined!  So, given that it will take me a while to use this whole thing, I'm very glad that each pack, and each box, is covered in cellophane and will last!

It's close to the same basic formula as the Gingery Mango sauce, but the peppers dominate the piquant component of the flavor profile while the ginger is relegated to a complementary role. The dominant flavor is still sweet with sour and tang closely behind. And despite the name it is still relatively mild. If you can eat Tabasco then this one will seem even milder.  It's slightly salty, but it only contains 10mg of sodium per tablespoon, which is more than acceptable for most sodium restricted diets.

And for the reviewers concerned about it not melting quickly... it's not supposed to. It's a FINISHING salt. It's a complete waste to cook with it, plus it's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt.  But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill, on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it, on roasted aspargus right out of the oven, or even over a fresh, crisp apple half - it's "Na" heaven! If you already use finishing salts, you know what difference they can make. And if you're not, it's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level. Bon appetite!

The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.

Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the "universal medicine."  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy."

4697	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have been using the very product for about a year.  I was purchasing it in the 4oz size.  This quart size is really perfect if you bake a lot.  For at least 15 years I was ordering the actual Vanilla Beans in bulk....50 at a time.  They are expensive.  Can run $1.00 - $2.50 per Vanilla Bean.  They also require a deft hand when it comes to splitting the bean and scraping out the tiny vanilla specs.  This product has the vanilla bean specs in it.  So simple, so easy to do....just measure.  And by-the-way, it even makes your baked goods taste terrific.  No more Vanilla Bean purchasing for me.  This product is every bit as good as a vanilla bean, with way less work.  And so much more economical.
But actually, since I use these teas for making homemade pitchers of iced tea, I don't really care about the packaging or wrapping differences. And I found the taste of the Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice to be pleasing and enjoyable.

6320	Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5	POS	5.0	I have been reading thru the post and it appears there is lots of confusion between the difference between Diastatic and Non Diastatic.  Diastatic barley malt contains an enzyme that convert starch in flour to sugar, to feed the yeast during fermentation of the dough.  It is added to promote the catalytic action.  Nondiastatic barley flour does not contain this enzyme, so it can be added in large quantities as a flavor enhancer.  My favorite past time is baking bread and a little of the diastatic goes a long ways (.5-1% flour weight) and is used during long & slow (overnight) fermentation.  Non diastatic is normally used in bagels and scones for flavor.  Its sole purpose is for its flavor.  That is why I am looking for it.  My sons really love the Stickyfingers Scones but they are way expensive and I think it's the malted barley flour (non diastatic) is what makes them so delicious and gives them the chewy texture.

We have been using the standard grocery store teeny bottle for years, and as we started baking more, figured it was time to invest in some quality vanilla. The difference is noticeable (to us at least) and as always, a tiny bit goes a long way. Rich, full, natural taste. It is an extract, but is not meant to be overpowering or very strong, more to add a hint of quality flavor. (basically - something strong does not mean it's good)

I drink a lot of tea and do a smoothie most mornings, and I often incorporate this honey into it as a natural sweetener. It sweetens my tea with very little, and it melts into the tea beautifully--honestly, the effect is hypnotic in my clear glass teacup. Sometimes I'll eat a small spoonful for a snack and energy pick-me-up midway between meals, and it is so satisfying that I can trade out a processed dessert for it.

I found out after drinking several boxes of this tea, it helped the pain of arthritis in my knees. I drink 1 to 3 cups per day. Beats paying $$$$ to get medicine from a doctor.
This one is great either hot or iced.
The container has a certain dclass air about it and would be right at home in a French bistro, so you might not feel a need to get a salt box. One would be advisable anyway, just in case, since box can't easily be used as a dispenser once it starts to empty out significantly.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as "peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia." Tazo also describes the aroma as "tropical fruit, green tea". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.

Far better, among Chipotle based hot sauces, are either the Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce or the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. Both of which are excellent and have a rich Chipotle favor and far surpass this sauce. The Tabasco has a fair amount of real vinegar added to the blend and the El Yucateco has less vinegar but some tomato and sugar has been added. Both of these sauces are really excellent yet different. Which you prefer would be based on how much vinegar you prefer in a hot sauce.

I love real maple syrup, and I've tried most major brands, as well as many smaller, local brands (I live in the northeast). The taste and consistency of Coombs is perfect and in line with all high quality maple syrups. This is how the real deal tastes and feels. I prefer a deep, rich maple flavor, so I keep a bottle of dark amber on hand at all times. If I'm feeling particularly sassy, or a frigid winter morning is threatening to keep me from work, I will actually use a dark grade B syrup. Generally speaking, that's reserved for cooking, but I love the robust, often complex taste and structure. It can become a transformative experience - I imagine the old growth forest that gently watched over the land for generations before, and who will continue its watchful eye for generations yet to come, and I find myself reconnecting with something much greater than myself. It is humbling and deliciously wonderful to be brought to my knees by the enormity of it. Who knew pancakes could elicit such a deep introspection. Pippa's pancake philosophy - It could revolutionize the world! It truly baffles me that the darker ambers are considered "sub-par" or of generally lesser quality. But hey... that's just me, I suppose. If you want milder flavor, go for a medium amber. If you just want a sweet coating for your pancakes, go for the light amber.... and never come to the northeast. LOL - just kidding (sort of).

I created a 'spray paint box' so as to not get the overspray all over the place, laid a piece of parchment paper (which I folded in half before placing in the box for ease of getting the pills back into their bottles), laid out the pills on the parchment, and LIGHTLY sprayed the pills.  All they need is a dusting of the color--enough to distinguish one from the other.  Dries practically instantly, and doesn't affect the pill at all.  Pick up the parchment, and with the crease as your 'funnel', slide the pills back in their bottle.  Repeat with any other pills you may be doing this with.
