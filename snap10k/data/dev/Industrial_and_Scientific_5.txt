It doesn't say that it's food grade on it, and it probably isn't but it spends such a short time in this tube, I'm not concerned. I clean it immediately and keep it in a dry place. Only used it four times so far, and no issues.
The Panel Handle shares a similar problem with the Gorilla: namely, stairs. However, with the Gorilla, I can shift my grab point forward a foot to cause the ply panel to hang down at the back, raising up the front corner and preventing me banging into the nose of the stair tread. With this Panel Handle, I don't have the similar flexibility, since the drywall isn't being "gripped" quite the same way -- it just takes a little more thought and finesse to climb to the next floor.
6277	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I love this tool. But yesterday I encountered something I want to share with other potential buyers. I was under my house to check a faulty circuit and it was really humid: probably 100% relative humidity. Anyway, I turned on my Fluke and started moving it from wire to wire to make sure it was working. Nothing. No beep, no constant light. So what's wrong? When I got back out and went into the garage I tested it on an exposed wire running into an outlet box. Sure enough, it beeped and the light came on. So what gives? Well, I did a little research, and the specs indicate it only works up to 95% relative humidity. Who would have guessed. Anyway, this is a minor drawback to me and I'd rate it 4.75 if I could.

The refrigerator is located inside a vented cabinet to protect it from grinding dust, etc.  I occasionally pull it from the cabinet to clean behind it.  These casters have made this task much easier.  The wheels installed without a problem at the rear of the refrigerator by drilling two holes and using an additional nut.  Replacing the adjustable feet in the front of the refrigerator was a little more difficult.  I had to drill and tap the existing threads for one of the front casters.  For the other front caster, I tack welded a 5/16" nut to the refrigerator.  Works awesome.

1606	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	I have been using caulk for a long, long time and I can honestly say this was the worst experience I have ever had.  It was used to seal a window.  First off, minimum set up time is 7-14 days, (despite DAP online instructions stating it sets within hours) ridiculous.  After that, it is supposed to remain somewhat flexible like silicone, it does not.  It is gummy and easily punctured with indents appearing randomly even after your smooth bead has begun to dry weeks later.  Second, it shrinks more than any other caulk I have used.  Supposedly the clear shrinks more than the other colors, but I would never use it again anyway so I don't know.  What I do know is that it sets into a thin, and I mean ultra thin layer that is very difficult to get scrape off, which you will most likely do once you see how much it shrinks.  I even set up a dehumidifier to help the curing since it was used for a basement window.  (Two of the uses written DIRECTLY on the tube). The instructions on DAP's site are incorrect about set up time, and I have read of people getting refunds due to this.  That still doesn't pay me for my time of having to remove this junk and start over with another caulk.
In any event, this glue is like all urethane glues. It requires a certain amount of moisture or humidity in and around the joint for the glue to set properly. This is a difficult concept for some folks to understand. This glue will not perform as intended if the materials are very dry and the humidity in the air is low. It NEEDS some amount of moisture in some manner for the glue to function as designed and to reach maximum strength. When I use this product I always moisten the surface of the wood slightly. I use a small sponge that is wrung out almost dry and then rub it firmly across the wood of the joint enough so that the moisture is evident. The wood will turn slightly darker as it absorbs moisture. Wait for about five minutes and then do it again. You want the wood to be very slightly damp only...NOT wet or dripping water. The glue will take care of the rest..!!!  Another thing to remember is that the glue does expand... It will push out of the joint. Watch for the glue and the bubbly look and clean it off as you wait for it to set. Keep a dry cloth handy and one dampened with paint thinner or a similar solvent. Once the glue sets completely and dries, you will meet a file or a chisel to remove it.....
6075	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Just fine!!!

1866	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I really like these screws for several reasons other than pocket screws. They start easy, square drive works well for me using the Kreg driver, they aren't bad to split my material and they hold well. I have not had the problems others have had stripping out or breaking the head off maybe because I usually predrill and I don't typically use them in hardwoods either. The only con is that they are more costly yet I am willing to continue if/when something better comes along. I use these in 3/4" material.

2072	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I was looking for a second caliper for woodworking to complement my Starrett caliper - and this fit the bill well.  I use the Starrett caliper in my shop for precision measurements when dimensioning wood for projects, or for measuring parts for assembly, or other shop tasks.  The problem was, I needed something to use outside in my carport where I store my wood, and where I do rougher cutting tasks.  I did not want to bring my 100$ Starrett outside for these "rougher" measuring tasks, plus you know how it is - once you bring the caliper to another location, you forget to bring it back in making it very inconvenient when you need it in the shop.  Plus, outside there was more of a chance of dropping the caliper, and the Starrett at $100+ was not the right tool.

4676	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Toggles like these are so much easier and stronger than the "anchors" that punch-in or screw-into the drywall or other mounting surface. Those end up chipping away/eating the material and still don't hold even HALF as strong as these toggles. One tip though. When you're pre-screwing the screw through the toggle just before you insert it into the wall (as shown in Amazon's picture), ensure you've screwed it completely through the toggle and it's little wire springs (again, as shown in Amazon's picture). If you don't screw it in past those little springs, the anchor can sometimes get caught up and twisted once inside the wall. At this time, it refuses to deploy properly, tighten up properly or really even unscrew properly so you can fix it. Years ago before I learned this, I cursed at these toggles several times. But once I realized you have to screw the screw completely through the toggle before folding it down and shoving it through the wall, life has been perfect. If you've got the money, the zip version of these is even nicer. Search the term "Zip Toggle". VERY VERY easy to use, but spendy.

5927	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Not sure why they sell Goop under all these different labels- it's all the same stuff.  But the good news is that Goop is a really useful adhesive.  It's strong and easy to remove off of smooth surfaces.  I use Goop on my race motorcycle to keep nuts and bolts from getting lose.  Unlike RTV, Goop is easy to remove with a pair of pilers. However, unlike RTV, it doesn't stand up to high temperatures as well, so I can't use it on the nuts which keep my exhaust headers in place.  But Goop works just fine for just about everything else.

The product is relatively easy to use, but be certain to follow the instructions to "dispense SLOWLY" (their emphasis).  It comes out fast until you get used to the trigger on the applicator tube, and does expand very rapidly.  A very small amount of practice before first use would be helpful.  Also, heed the instructions for proper mixing (shake for a minute, make sure the ball bearing inside is freely moving while shaking).

The second repair project was for a shoe with a sole that had delaminated.  After being gouged by the only shoe repair shop within a reasonable distance of my residence, I decided to do this repair myself.  My concern originally was that I didn't have a hydraulic press to provide adequate compression during the drying process.  Fortunately, I was able to find two hardware clamps that worked well.  At the time, I didn't realize how important this was as Gorilla Glue expands so much that without mechanical clamps, too much polyurethane would have formed between the sole and body of the shoe. Hence, I was surprised to find a fairly significant mess the next morning as the expanded glue leaked out and dried onto the sides of the sole.  While this mess was an irritation, the sole had remained firmly attached.

I bought this paint which is much thinner to see if it'll adhere better and look good for a longer amount of time.  I'm also using it to touch up anything that's rusty that used to be black.  Motorcycle frames, car starter motor covers, etc...  A tiny can goes a long way if you can find a way to keep it sealed from air.  I use a plastic bag between the lid and the can when I re-seal it because it'll glue itself into place otherwise.  Don't paint your skin with this unless you want a black spot on yourself for two weeks.  It doesn't come off with acetone or a scrub brush the next morning if you go to bed with it on yourself.

Note: This glue will not stick to plastics very well, so for that, I use the old style Testors Cement For Plastic Models, No. 3512, 7/8 fl. oz. (25.8mL) (UPC Code: 0 75611 35120 9), and yes, it may be hard to find, as kids used to get high (and sick) from sniffing the fumes from it in a paper bag. Most model cements nowadays are safer to use, but do not stick as well. The old stuff would literally melt the plastic pieces being glued together. At this point, I am beyond putting together plastic models, but I find that the Testors glue is one of the best for plastics, and today, just about everything is made from one type of plastic or another.

I had a concrete fountain bowl that weighed over 200 pounds in the front yard.  Weather extremes and age caused it to break in half on the pedestal.  My failure to keep the drainage holes clean in winter might have had something to do with it.  I cleaned it up, propped up one half on its side, covered both halves thoroughly and liberally J-B Weld and placed the halves together.  I allowed them to sit there and cure for a week.  I then covered both sides with a thick layer of exterior construction Liquid Nails and allowed it to dry another week before placing the heavy bowl back on the pedestal. That was over a year ago.  The repaired joint will last longer than the original concrete.

6263	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	After a well handled issued that I had with Fluke, they got me straight with this Voltage Tester and I could not be more pleased.  I fully respect (spelled correctly?) electricity and will not mess with connections unless I know beyond any reasonable doubt that the power is off.  Over the years, I bought several of those really cheap testers each of us has and they worked o.k.,  until this past year.  I put the red and black to the line and it said it was not hot (electrical talk).  But when I unwound a wire nut and started to unwind the two wires.  ZAP!!  That jody was hot.  It almost lit me up.  With several electrical jobs  waiting for my attention, I put my faith in the Fluke iAC-A1-II and they gained a new customer.  It worked well and without any problems.  I can even open it, now.  When it comes time for different type testers and so forth I will be checking out Fluke.

  -- second, surface preparation is just as important as the adhesive you use.  If you have gun oil, or dust, or finger-prints, or other contamination on either surface being bonded, the adhesion will fail.  So before you use ANY adhesive, clean all hardware (nuts, bolts, screws, etc) AND any threaded holes in items you are gluing, anything into/onto which the bolt or nut will be threaded.  If you have unlimited resources, you can buy the recommended Loctite primers.  I'm dirt poor, and a can of acetone from the hardware store (applied with an old toothbrush and pipe-cleaners) works great for me, and cost maybe 10% what the Loctite stuff goes for.  [ Note - Loctite Primer N 7649 actually **IS** acetone; nothing more. ]
The package indicates the self-drilling is limited to wood, although it will likely work for most plastics as well.  They are not designed to self-drill in concrete or metal, including sheet metal. However, the product is simply advertised as "self-drilling" without any additional information, or otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  I feel this is deceptive advertising.

Philips acquired the Seattle-based company Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000. When Optiva first introduced the Philips Sonicare Advance circa 1992, it was unlike any electric toothbrushes on the market. Sonicare Advance used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by Optiva Corp. The technology allows the Sonicare Advance to produce a dizzying 31,000 brush strokes per minute (BSPM)! No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since (sorry,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Oral-B-Triumph/dp/B000U08ZN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Oral B Triumph</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Crest-Spinbrush/dp/B00170KCXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Crest Spinbrush</a>).

The only things I wouldn't use these for are certain applications that need a very tight hold.

Here are my observations:
6347	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Very well put together and sent quickly.  Rough running at first, but that is because they don't oil it down with mineral oil to send it out.  Now that it is oiled it runs pretty smooth.  Also read the short simple instructions and you will be able to realize that most if not all problems have been dealt with (at least so far as my experience is concerned and I have been using micrometers for quite a few years now as a Mechanical Engineer in the shop ;))
3352	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Item arrived on time. DAP is a trusted name in the construction field.

Other reviewers have noted problems with this tape removing paint and other finishes from the surface it was stuck to. In my opinion, you have a choice here: protect the finish or hold something in place. If you want to protect the finish, use masking tape. By the time you escalate to this kind of tape, you've decided "holding" is more important than preserving the finish, and you can proceed accordingly.

3117	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I bought this item based on the good reviews and I thought it would save me money by prolonging the filter life. However things did not go as planned. One of the units broke down less than 1 month of use. Luckily it was still in the return window and I easily got it exchanged. For those who wonder, I did not dip it all the way down , so it was not my obvious fault it broke down. Second one has been working fine in terms of getting on and off as it supposed to but the readings of the same sample within ten minutes is completely different. The variation is more than 10%, so accuracy is questionable. Besides, I change the filter and compare the before and after readings and do not see a change at all. You can say that the filter itself is not working and it may be true, but I feel the difference in taste while this machine sees nothing in numbers. So if I had a second chance, I would not buy this item, yet so far it has saved me nothing at all.

1943	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is the real thing!  I've bought other transparent "duct tapes" before, but they were simply heavy transparent tapes.  This is what it says: TOUGH!  I've used it in exactly the same way as regular duct tape and it holds beautifully.  It can be seen, but it is so much less obvious that it suits my needs perfectly--to hold things still and securely and not be an ugly, stick out color that looks just awful with the surroundings.  One application is that I'm using it to hold a little throw rug in place to keep my cats from digging at the carpet underneath it.  It works.  It's as if they've forgotten about where they used to scratch at the spot, and they are leaving the throw rug alone while it's held securely, almost invisibly in place.  It sure looks better than that hole they were scratching in the carpet, thanks to this transparent duct tape.

Ordinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.

The larger sections of the pole function by means of a V-pin with two buttons on opposite sides of the pole. Rather like a swiffer pole.

It works nice, looks great when setup, and it does have the ability to fill fairly large gaps without cracking over time -- I've personally used it on gaps up to 1/4". Used with a high-quality drip-less gun, this is the ticket. It costs more, but caulking isn't something that you want to redo after it cracks 5 years down the road. Highly recommended.

The 'scope is weightier than my previous one, but not an uncomfortable weight; It feels substantial.  I have yet to wear it over a 12hr shift so I'm not sure if it will get uncomfortable as time goes by.  The name tag is a nice bonus to help keep your 'scope from growing legs and wandering off.  I am very happy with the lifetime parts program; I hope to not have to use it anytime soon, but to have the option without buying a new "scope is awesome!

I have several type 1 and type 2 red (for gas) and yellow (for diesel) cans and will never buy another plastic fuel can.  Since 2009, the federal government has mandated that all plastic fuel cans incorporate a pouring mechanism that spills fuel down the side of your car and onto your shoes.  These metal cans are somehow exempt from the mandatory fuel spilling requirements. The type 1 cans are good for filling from the top (like a tractor or generator).  For filling from the side (like an automobile) I would recommend the type 2 cans with a nozzle.  You will love these cans!

Goop is great for sealing small leaks (including garden hose connections, etc.).  However, you have to turn off the water, and the connections must be absolutely dry.  Moreover, it takes several days for Goop to dry to reasonable strength.  If you turn on the pressure before then you will make a water balloon.  It's better to wait a week.  Moreover, it may take several applications to get a thick enough layer of Goop to hold against normal household pressure--so a sink, toilet, etc. may be out-of-commission for at least three days waiting for the Goop to dry.

2874	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	2.0	I was hoping for more but these leads are reminiscent of those sold by bargain electronics houses in the 60s and 70s.  The wire is of a very light gauge which has more meaning than just current carrying capacity.  They do not stand up to flexing and will break after a short period of use.  I became curious about how the lead wires were bonded to the clips.  I pulled off a few covers and couldn't see how this was done.  finally I saw the end of a copper wire sticking out of the crimp next to where the insulation went in.  I subjected one to destructive analysis and found that after the end of the wire had been stripped the copper wire had been bent back along the insulation and the clip was crimped on it.  Without being soldered the electrical connection won't be good for long.  Wear from bending will gradually soften the insulation and the force that holds the wire and clip in contact will weaken resulting in an a high resistance connection.  Also the crimping was not uniform from one clip to another, some of them being just barely holding.  This indicates a primitive manufacturing jig or maybe they were crimped by hand using pliers.

1772	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	One of the biggest issues with 3D printing, outside of printer reliability, software stability, and finding the right combination of speed and extrusion rate is build volume.

DIY printers are usually not much larger, unless you are a SERIOUS builder.
The rod comes rough-cut at both ends. I simply touched it up with a Dremmel tool and it's ready to go. The other benefit of a brass rod is that it can be used to tap parts without marking them, if done carefully. This is a good all-purpose tool helper to keep around.

6939	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	This stuff sticks all into the threads and gets torn up into tons of little pieces, so if you ever unscrew the fittings you applied it to, it's nearly impossible to remove properly.  When you then screw things back together, perhaps with new tape on the male end which is easier to clean, the tiny pieces all get pushed out of the much harder to clear female end and foul the gas line, potentially damaging whatever appliances you have connected or clogging a filter at best.  I had a propane distribution arrangement constructed of several T's and such, and when I needed to remove one fitting for a change, this fact forced me to deconstruct the entire arrangement so that I could effectively get all the little bits and pieces out of the fittings.  What a pain!  I wasn't about to do that again, so this hit the trash and I picked up some liquid PTFE thread seal, which works MUCH better.  Not only do I not worry about contaminating the gas line now, but the liquid sealant helps lubricate the fittings making it possible/easier to tighten them down further.  Search YouTube for a comparison of PTFE tape versus liquid to see others in agreement before you buy this!

When you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.

Most of the other glues dries in the tube after the first use so it is useless after that or they give you such a teeny amount of glue in the tube.  You get 4 liquid grams in this tube which is a decent amount and should last for many applications.  This glue is a gel but a very viscous gel so it will get into all the cracks and crevices needed.  I bought this to fill in the cracks on the stem of the briar wood of my tobacco smoking pipe and it worked like a miracle.  The glue does dry to a slight white haze but I was able to carefully sand that down.  This product brings back old nostalgic memories of when I was a kid  watching the Krazy Glue commercial of the construction worker's hard-hat being glued to the metal beam.

This dial indicator did just that. I had a Harbor Freight dial indicator and magnetic base. It took inaccurate measurements. It caused me untold stress and aggravation. I purchased this and the magnetic base needed to do differential work and got things "dialed in" on the first attempt. This is a very accurate instrument. It is very well made.

This tone generator pairs well with both my Fluke and Greenlee probes. It has an external switch for tone selection so when using two of them at once you can set each to provide a different tone. There is also a continuity setting which can also be used to provide talk battery. The switch that selects the tone is also the on-off switch and when you stuff this thing into a bag it is quite easy to turn it on by accident and over time the battery will drain. I find it better to switch it to continuity and make sure the clips don't touch when stored away. This toner is designed to work primarily on "dry circuits" but will work when tracking POTS lines. Digital is another matter. I find that if you try to tone a live digital circuit it may short out and no tone is generated. That all depends on what type of digital circuit it is. Other than losing one of these I have experienced no other problem with them.


8464	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Hanging things inside the sink is an interesting idea, and this hook is very attractive and a good match for a stainless steel sink. However, it's meant to be installed before the sink itself is installed, using a backing strip to be taped on the outside of the sink. If you can squeeze under the kitchen counter and get it done, you can attach it to a sink that is already installed, but it's awkward. The magnets are strong, and it beats hanging things over the faucet to drain.

I found the quality of the the tool to be very good. Not flimsy at all. I expect years of service given normal care in handling. The tone generator has a nice lanyard to hang it by when you are attaching it to various wall boxes etc, so that you don't wind up hanging it by its leads, a nice touch that should add to longevity.  I like that it comes with a case to keep everything together since this is the sort of tool I will only use occasionally and if it is knocking about in my kit without a case I'd be sure to misplace one part or another.

Water (H2O) ionizes into hydrogen (H+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions. When these ions are in equal proportions, the pH is a neutral 7. When there are more H+ ions than OH- ions then the water is said to be acid. If OH- ions outnumber the H+ ions then the water is alkaline. The pH scale goes from 0 to 14 and is logarithmic, which means that each step is ten times the previous. In other words, a pH of 4.5 is 10 times more acid than 5.5, 100 times more acid than 6.5 and 1,000 times more acid than 7.5.

Needless to say, I had some major plumbing and re-routing of plumbing lines to do in order to install this 5 foot tall whole house filter.  I used a combination of both PEX and some copper fittings.  The big filter and the spin-down pre-filter both had male and female NPT and MPT fittings.  I was very familiar with this style of fitting and always used regular PTFE thread tape.

799	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I agree with the reviewers that said the cutter is duller than a hoe.  I bought this to replace the grommets in my boots that were causing my laces to fray. I marked this down because after many solid whacks I barely cut one new hole in my boot as the cutter was exceptionally dull. However, after I touched up the cutter on my diamond coated grinding wheel, it cut like a hot knife through butter and I finished the 11 other holes in less time that I did the first one.  If the company who makes the cutter only took a few seconds to sharpen the cutter against a grinding wheel this would be one exceptional kit.
2180	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I won't contest other reviews being low quality or not working, but mine work great, and the teeth line up just right to fit together.  Maybe I got lucky, but mine are great for the price paid.

7034	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This product is exactly as described, and arrived on my doorstep in a timely manner. I use this as a steam tube for a home-built scientific distilled water maker. I would like to note that when heated near a rubber stopper, the tubing turned a strange yellow color. Though that is likely the poor quality of the rubber in my stopper at fault rather than this tubing.
8748	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I had never heard of Spax screws until I ran into a distributor at a big box hardware store stocking the shelves a few years ago.  I described my project and they picked out a screw for me.  It turned out to be perfect for the intended use and the self-drilling feature was a big benefit. I bought this variety box on Amazon and used several of a certain size, but it costs an arm and leg to buy either a small number of a certain size or a large quantity, so I ended up just buying another variety set.  That's my only complaint. If I could buy 100 of a certain size at a reasonable price I'd be happier.
7408	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Hard to describe a product with so many possibilities.

Because these fittings are brass, (a very soft material), and meant for an air compressor, I was surprised that they didn't have better protection of the exposed pipe thread ends. Most had an ID tag-tape made of a paper-thin, (about .005) plastic material, wrapped around one end of the exposed thread. Of course, these tags aren't meant to offer any protection. Many of these fittings were packaged together loosely in a plastic bag and then shipped in a bubble wrapped envelope.

Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)
It's pricey, but I refuse to use that cheap junk that other companies make.  Junk just falls apart.  This stuff is top notch though.
1250	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Great product. These allowed me to install 12' long crown molding by myself on 10' tall ceilings.

4855	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	These work awesomely with the Watts Water PEX and SharkBite pex, along with the Watts barbed fittings. They hold tight, and are fairly easy to remove should you need to. Don't know what else to say than that :)
3279	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This is very high quality cable.  THe price point was great.  I have had no problems with it and it can hold a lot of weight.  Make sure you got some good cable cutters to cut it to size.

Don't think twice, don't look at other crappy tape, and don't bark at the price - you'll get a hefty roll with plenty of tape for the price, but most importantly you'll enjoy every time you use it :) Have fun...

Anyway, I'm not sure why I ended up in this hell hole, but I guess it must be because the TSA really doesn't like seeing such large testicles on their full body scanners... I think they're just jealous. ;)
841	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I knew that when I bought it, but wasn't willing to pay double the price for a vent cap, so I will just pour at an angle to avoid the gluging and splashing of fuel.

3366	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I'm building a large pond and am in the process of rocking it in. I'm using both cement and "waterfall foam" for everything underwater as it is "fish safe." It comes in a similar can but for a much higher price. It, too, is black, which does help make it unobtrusive. I wouldn't use this for in-the-pond cementing as I don't know if it is biologically safe, or made to last while permanently underwater. However, I also have a lot of rock work on walls that don't get wet (unless briefly when it rains), and here I need something really sticky to glue the stones in place, and fill the voids behind them. It takes some practice to get the right amount into a crack -- not too much or it will expand and spew out, all over the place. It's better to be conservative at first, and go back and add a little more if necessary, until you get the hang of it.

Others have had problems but if I get a piece that is not right for any reason I know I can return it.
The rechargeable SoniCare toothbrushes cost much more, even at Costco.  And then the rechargeable batteries would go bad at some point anyway, and replacing them was such a pain.

However, this past weekend I had to make some connections in my whole-house PEX system -- and I turned to these stainless connectors. I found that they were just as easy to install as the copper rings. In some situations, I could see these being preferable to the copper rings.
5858	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	I LOVE this stuff!  It has repaired more products than I can recall.  This time it was an outside wine barrel planter.  Not only are these hard to find, they are impossible for an old lady to pick up, fit into the car, then haul into the yard and fill with dirt, after emptying and disposing of the old worn out one.  So investing in a roll of this tape enables me to keep the ones I have.

1. Remove the old thermal compound. This is accomplished by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. I recommend purchasing an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ArctiClean-kit/dp/B0007TOR08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ArctiClean kit</a>. For minimal cost it will give you the compound remover, as well as an excellent surface preparer. Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.

 - I do keep it in a tightly-closed jar with 2 dessicant packs ((10 grams total of silicon granules)), but not in the fridge, because I use it too often.  It seems to still flow as it ought to, although the tip does clog a bit, probably because I only snipped off a tiny part of the tip so that the opening is *just barely* large enough for me to insert a slender pin.  But that's the trade-off when one works on a small scale.
1781	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	This glue works very well on filling larger than normal gaps in your projects.  Fill the gap, give a quick shot of Insta-set accelerator and then fill some more if needed.

That sentence above is really all you need to say. But if you're new to the game, heres a bit more. This is the defacto fix everything tape. Wrap it around something and it will be fixed. It will stay put, it won't leak, it will hang on to your car, it won't budge. It just does all that. You can pull out a length and tear it off. It will stick and stay stuck. It will come off when you want it to and won't leave a mess. It is all that. If its color is black and you work in show biz, its Gaffers Tape. This one is slate blue, which is a nice neutral color. Its Duct Tape and its made by 3M. Get it.

 UPDATE: Well, it's five years later and I still have small rugs stuck to carpet! A couple have been pulled up and stuck straight back (with the same tape) and It works, but too well. I think I've replaced the tape once (if that) on one or two because I wanted to move a rug slightly and the tape stuck to the carpet instead of the rug (not complaining, it kept it where I wanted it as long as I wanted it there, no matter what!) The problem (if I had the audacity to complain) is that t takes a good 10-15 minutes to peel up an edge. I recently had to pull up my huge living room rug and replace the tape and I didn't remember it being such an ordeal but lordy! I won't change my rating because my awesome vacuum cleaner won't suck up the smallest rug, even stuck to carpet but dang, I don't remember it being so difficult to install!! It's literally SO hard to pull an edge up of the tape that I just did two sides of my huge rug and hope no one trips on the sides I didn't do I don't have the strength to go thru that again for two more sides! I'm sure I'll change my mind when I vacuum it next time but for now, ugh!! Just kill me!

Wishes: (1) I really wish there was a better way to clean out the tube.  Instructions say to use their brand of gun cleaner, or acetone.  Not wanting to use much of a bottle of my wife's nail polish remover (acetone), I used fairly high pressure water through the tube, shortly after use before it could start curing.  That actually worked moderately well, but not completely.  It's still easy to see some of the yellow foam residue on the inside of the tube (a bright yellow color).  There is plenty of room in the applicator tube for the next time I use the product, but over time I'm concerned that would build up.  (2) It also would be nice if there was more instruction about temperature considerations.  Only one mention of temperature (other than appropriate caution about storing in a high heat environment) is as follows: "Tack free in 8 minutes, trims in 30 minutes (up to 1" bead @ 75F (24C) and 50% relative humidity).  What does that really mean?  It just takes longer in colder or warmer temperatures, or one can only use smaller beads of foam in higher or lower temperatures?  Or something else?  What's the temperature range of use?  It just simply does not say anywhere on the can.  For information, I did use it to seal a place where our gutter meets the roof line that had not been properly sealed to prevent water back-up under the roof (yes, I realize that's not the listed, intended use - but it works great!).

The tone is strong enough to easily find wires behind drywall, but this is also the source of my one and only complaint: If you have a box with several electrical lines going into it, even if you separate all the lines inside the box and at their "far" ends so that there is zeero continuity between separate lines, the signal still tends to "splash" onto all the other lines. In a box with three lines I got signal on all three even though the tone generator was only attached to one. This is more pronounced where the lines are closest together (at the box, of course).  This led to some confusion when I was in a small closet and no matter where I put the probe I got signal!  Imagine my surprise to see that the line I was tracing lead not only UP from the box to the ceiling,  but DOWN to the floor as well.... and off to the side too! Whoops! That ain't right!  However with a little patience and understanding of what was happening I was able to eventually sort out the individual runs. Further from the box the signal drops off on the non-connected lines faster than on the connected line. So I had to take a few educated guesses as to where the line I was tracing might be, and then move far away from the box and look for it. With a few tries I found each line and traced them to their ends. Bottom line: this thing works, and it works thorugh drywall, but it still requires you to use some brains.

The thick gel version can be used as a filler for small spaces where mixing epoxy would just be too much trouble.  And with the included activator, the repair job is ready to use in a matter of minutes.
In short.. (which incidentally works fine with this, of course) .. I have to give this an unexpected thumbs up.  While it is nowhere near the Rigol class, for a hobbyist, this is a rock solid power supply.  I will (obviously) follow this review up with an addendum if it blows up on me.

You can easily extend the supports to the proper length as you would with a pipe clamp and then chinch it tight with the hand hand grip.  The grip and ball joints at the top and bottom are made of plastic and would appear to be easy to break.  If it does, the support becomes useless.  This concern is why I rated it with 4 stars.  However, I've dropped mine on hard tile twice now and have not broken anything yet.
My personal Sonicare experience:
Now as far as removal goes, that's going to be a problem. This is not a glue you can put acetone on and remove. Once you put this on something and it cures, a chemical reaction has occurred and it's there for good. In most cases, attempting to remove this will wreck the actual items being bonded before it damages the bond itself. So needless to say, this isn't something made for temporary usage whatsoever.
Cons:

After receiving a great batch of cups lightening quick from "WelDun Solutions" I wrote the following positive review and re-ordered some more of them.
The suction is superior, also. I cleaned my large, wool area rugs which tend to absorb the cleaning solution very readily. With other machines, I didn't get much water back out and I had to set fans blowing on the rugs to get them dry within a day. This machine extracted way more of the dirty water than any other machine I've ever used except for a rented Rug Doctor. My rugs were dry to the touch within about 3 hours. This is super important for households with crawling babies because it's unsafe for them to crawl on newly cleaned rugs that aren't completely dry. Plus, it's so much easier to maneuver than a Rug Doctor.

So I wasn't really sure the hook would stick well with that thickness sink wall. Well it does stick good. I found that the magnet is actually removable from the hook. See photos. The magnet also has a rounded domed surface on one side and a significant flat spot on the other. You can use either side you want. So if you want your hook to rotate freely use the domed side, if you want it to rotate less freely then use the flat side to the sink. I could still rotate it with the flat side down, but it was noticeably harder to do so.
This type lasted all summer in the hot Southern California sun with no problem.
1895	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	Very good tape, but not an excellent tape.  The glue is not as strong as I expected from a tape that calls itself professional duct tape.  I can still remember the old duct tape my dad used to buy.  I have no idea where he got it, but the glue on it was so sticky it would hold nearly anything, this tape isn't as good as that.  However, it tears like duct tape should, and is sufficient for about 90% of jobs you would expect duct tape to handle.  It's only the 10% I feel it is too weak for that I deduct the star.

2960	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	NEG	1.0	These are absolutely the worst leads I've ever seen.  They prove that the "cheap overseaas" moniker is deserved and --astoundingly-- devolving.  The wire is maybe 28 AWG, _maybe_.  It's uncoated copper, pre-corroded (turning green/black).  The plastic coating is a bit rougher (which initially seemed nice, versus the previous el-cheapo leads with shiny plastic coating).  The clips are of course awful.  The clips are crimped (not soldered) onto the wires and coating, with the bared wires folded back over the coating...meaning that simply "adding a dab of solder to the crimp" (which used to work on all previous el-cheapo leads) no longer works and instead causes a molten, stinky plastic mess.

I use this to jack up my RV (which is 16K pounds), and don't mind using a 20 ton to make sure I have "overkill".  When I have to work under the RV without a tire on, and have the luxury of being in my driveway at home, I tend to have a lot of redundancy for safety measures - for instance, if I take a tire off one side, I use two bottle jacks and two jack stands under the frame in various locations to make 100% sure there will be no failure.  Of course, I also chock the other wheels.  I don't want to trust any one, or even two, components for failure when my life depends on it.  When I am travelling, to save on weight and portability, I only carry the 12 ton with jack stands, and carry a block of wood or two for stability of the jack in case I am on gravel, dirt, etc.  I am extra careful until I get a jack stand or two under it on the road, I don't have the luxury of concrete, multiple jacks on the road..... but it is still enough.

However it just dropped from 5 stars to two when it jumped within one month from $5.83 to $14+ tax.  That's more than a 200% price hike and difficult to justify.  It brings it from the most reasonably priced product-- to one of the most expensive (with equal quality and less pricey brands on the market).  I have to question what warrants such a price hike.  When that happens I start shopping for alternatives.
Everything else seems fine
9586	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	4.0	I regretted buying these a little bit, mostly due to the price. Not they they are not fine quality, but no better than something half the price.

It has a little LCD window that displays the reading as well as which mode its readings are in (inch or metric). It changes mode with the push of a button and calibrates the same way. I use mine to determine inside and outside dimensions of materials I use to create models and robotic devices. It takes an R-44 type battery and they send along one already mounted plus a spare. This is my second of these, the first was the victim of a heavy fanny belonging to a friend who didn't look before he sat. Frump, frump, frump.

I think it's breaking point is 1500 lbs, which is actually the lowest rating of all the other parts of my zipline.  Still, it should handle a kid weighing 50 lbs easily. Can't overbuild enough.

Super-Glue (Krazy Glue):  Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast.  In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required.  Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects.  Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, and clear epoxies have become available.  Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tightly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BAZIC-Super-Glue-3-grams-0-10-ounces-6-Per-Pack/dp/B003BSF7ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per Pack</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Krazy-Glue-KG92548R-Instant-Krazy-Glue-All-Purpose-Brush-0-18-Ounce/dp/B000BQSFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Krazy Glue KG92548R Instant Krazy Glue All Purpose Brush 0.18-Ounce</a>

Our situation is this. We have a Home Depot type of waterfall with three levels. The bottom level is about 30" wide, 15" tall, and sort of a tiered circular shape, all concrete and quite heavy. We've had it for years but it has leaked for the past year or so. We lose about 1" of water a day. I could not find out where the leak was so I wanted to spray the entire inside of the bottom section to seal up any small cracks or perhaps porous sections where the water might seep through. I prepared by taping off the top level where the water line should be. I wanted to coat the entire area below the water line. This is not a proper application for the Great Stuff product as it does not spray but rather ejects a tube like foam.
They come in a really nice case they came in and make for easy retrieval from your truck when you need them.

992	Industrial_and_Scientific_5	POS	5.0	Works as stated
... and so much more to come.

Also, you can get it off if you really need to, it won't mess up the surfaces of what it's gluing.
BUT, this low of a price means you're not getting the functionality of a high end machine. For example, the steam is pretty wet, and you'll also get a big dribble of water when you start up after pausing for a few moments. The tank is rather small, and you can't add more water without letting it cool down first. The attachments are OK in terms of function, but wear at a fairly fast rate. Build quality is good for the price paid, but you'll need to take care that you don't damage the wands since they are all plastic.
None of it seems to work like it did 20 years ago.

If you follow those steps, you will see a massive improvement in your core temps. Just remember that heat dissipation is achieved by the fans in your case and heatsinks, not the compound itelf. The compound simply allows for a much better transfer of heat from chip-->heatsink. I swear by Arctic Silver, and I promise you it works if you use it correctly.
