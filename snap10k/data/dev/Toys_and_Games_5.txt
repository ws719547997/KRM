He was fine with the number of Keeper abilities. There were kind of a lot of creepers though. More than any other version I've played. But it's okay, they were funny too. Highly recommend to Fluxx lovers who also love Monty Python!

Each of the players (up to 5) plays one of the hobbits from the books (including Fatty Bolger, who is included in the game even though he was left out of the recent movies). The goal is for the hobbits to trek the one ring to Mt. Doom before Sauron can claim it as his own. To do so, players will need to work together to draw and play cards allowing them to move through each section of the story successfully. While doing so, they will often draw cards or run into scenarios in which Sauron will draw closer to victory. There is a bit of luck and a good deal of strategy involved.

It's a pretty hard game to master even on the easy level, but you can argue that the same can be said about games like Pandemic and Forbidden Desert. But the game in itself is pretty fun and the challenge is one you really want to defeat. And once you're comfortable with the easy level of difficulty, things just get worse at higher difficulties - and that's just how the game works.
Pathfinder: A 64-page fully-bounded book with high-grade, full-color pages.  Like the Starter Set, this also includes a single-player choose-your-own adventure.  However, this only encompasses the first eight pages, as opposed to the entire 32 page-booklet of 4E.  You can only play through the adventure as a basic fighter (as opposed to branching off so you can play a variety of classes) but this turns out to be an asset here.  As a first-time player, you are actually told a story, one of a simple citizen from a town called Sandpoint called forth from the mayor to stop a menacing foe that is lurking in a dungeon.  You learn the basics of rolling dice for attacks and skill checks, and encounter some dangerous traps and a formidable final foe.  It's a simple scenario that actually hooks you in with a little bit of adrenaline.  Shakespeare it's not, but it definitely hooks the reader to learn more.

His latest trick is to quickly glance around whatever room he happens to be in, find something to climb up on, and then start singing the song and jumping off whatever he climbed up on at the appropriate moment.  Of course he climbs right back up because he has to play the part of all FIVE monkeys, naturally!

I was glad there was a classic version available, but I didn't remember the ice cream cone in the head. I looked it up and saw that the ice cream came along in 2004; that's pretty late to be "classic." I wish it was exactly like the one I had as a kid. I wonder why companies keep making "classic" and "retro" editions of games and toys but including changes that make the game or toy not the way it was. It's still better than playing on one of the new boards, but the fake parts in the classic/retro games are sad reminders that we may never again play the same games we played as kids.

2083	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	My 4 year old who is not easily scared was just creeped out by the concept and literally told me that the elf looked "creepy". He wouldn't have anything to do with it after that so for us it was useless. I agree the doll is kinda creepy just chilling around your house and "leaving in the night to report to santa".
He has been dragged, rolled over by her doll carriage, sat upon, slept on, pulled on (ears, tail, etc.) and he seems to be withstanding the abuse very well!

They loved it and had so much fun with it! I believe Elf on the Shelf is a relatively new tradition but I love the look of the scout elf because he has the look of a 1950s figurine. Included in the very sturdy and reusable box is the elf and a colorful, hardcover storybook which explains in a rhyming, storytelling manner how to use the Elf on the Shelf. The elf itself is approximately 13 inches tall, fully-extended, and his outfit feels like it is made of a felt-like material. His body is stuffed with plastic pellets and his head is made of hard plastic with nicely painted-on facial features. He doesn't sit very well by himself but there are plenty of ways to prop him up. His hands are also stitched together which makes it fun to dangle him from a doorknob, chandelier, or any other fun spot you can think of!

They do have an app now for this game, but I still enjoy playing the material one. Once you master all of the levels, then you can go back and try to complete each level in less steps. It really does require a lot of visual-spacial planning and thinking. You have to rearrange the cars in your mind. If you're looking for a fun game for children and adults alike, especially one that exercises your brain, then this is a home run. It's one of our favorites. It also encourages solitary play, which is a very important skill for kids. I highly recommend this.

3745	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Amazing game, one of the all time best, but it is frustrating that there are only single copies of some cards when decks can have 3 copies of cards. That means that if you enjoy the game and want to play competitively in tournaments, you'll have to buy 3 copies of the game. Most players won't play competitively, obviously, but it is a small but significant oversight in an otherwise flaweless game.
1551	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Exactly as pictured. My only problem is I wish the manufacturer would make the elf have wires in its arms and legs so that he can be positioned in any way as I always thought that was the case anyhow... it wouldn't be hard to do either.

We continued in this gasping for air style of play for about 3 more rounds before we calmed down enough to get into more of the subtleties of the game.  It is at times hilarious, thought provoking and insightful of those you play with.  How funny or insightful depends on the players' effort, but if you are truly trying to win, you'll be surprised how many people you can fool with bogus phrase endings.  I highly recommend this game!

It is amusing, and challenging.  But with a lot of new players, can drag on a bit, if people don't fully understand the strategy.  A full game can take two hours if you have 8 people, many of whom have never played it before.  This can cause the game to get a little...tiresome, and is best if enough people know what to do and can plan ahead of time (This is true for all board games of this type).

5951	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I avoided this game for a while because I thought it was too complicated when reading the rules. It actually isn't and even as a 1 player game, it's a lot of fun. The 4 star rating comes from the rule book, it's terrible lol. The rules are very difficult to understand and are not specific enough, I play a lot of games and read many rule books, this was tough for me to understand, I looked up a quick YouTube walk through of the game and I grasped it right away.
The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the material seems like it would be likely to rip if more than 2 or 3 kids were playing with it at the same time. When we have alot of kids come to our house I usually hide the bus! (especially if the children are older than 7 or so). So far the inflatable steering wheel has held up well. I noticed that other reviews complain of the steering wheel deflating or getting holes in it; thus far that hasn't been a problem for us.

Mechanics- I wasn't being glib above.  The rules are that simple, and that's fantastic.  Also, this game has a semi-realistic economy.

This feels like a pocket Lords of Waterdeep! 5/5

It has brought back so many fun memories for me.  I am so happy that I can share this fun game with my children.  No skill is required and because it's all about matching colors it's a very simple game.  There is a reason it has been around for so long.  Also, the pieces are large enough they aren't a choking hazard.  My 5yr old and I played and my 8mnth old just chewed on the pieces we were not using.  It was a win win for all 3 of us!

Once you set up the miniatures as depicted, the player's task is to move the cars until a path is cleared for the target car to escape the gridlock.

My one BIG complaint is the saucer of the model is so heavy compared to the body, it does  not set in the holding stand well. If its touched or the stand is moved its pretty much a given the model is going to fall off of the stand. Major fail on Eaglemoss's  end for a toy that retails for 35 to 50 dollars in the US.

265	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this game as a cheap introduction to what D&D world would be, and to introduce my GF and some friends to a boardgame with a  little more RPG Elements than just rolling dice and killing stuff, the game was a real success the gameplay is easy to learn and the game may seem to be very straight forward but it will depends of the people playing it how fun can it be
As for the net, it seems to be exactly what I thought it would be. The quality is exactly what I would expect for a kids toy.  My 6 and 5 year olds are enjoying checking in on their cocoons every morning. :)
This toy is a hit with my 6 year old son!  My son loves math, so when we received this product, he immediatly wanted to start playing with it.  I like that you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide with it, so my son will be able to grow with this toy.  He is going into 1st grade, so it is nice that he can practice adding and subtracting, all while having fun with 'an electronic' toy.  He even took it with him in the car and played on it the entire 4 hour car ride to go on vacation.

The FFG version will last through hundreds of hours of play.  There are numerous variations of play available by swapping game board tiles and sides of those tiles, by varying the spell deck, and by altering the winning criteria.
Don't get me wrong, Fantasy Flight did produce a beautiful game and the quality of the pieces are "first-rate", but it doesn't save the mechanics and details of game play.

Cons, the forceps & tweezers are cheap.

As far as core mechanics go, it's only for 2 players with each player selecting one corporation or runner from a group of factions, but one player must play as a Runner (the hacker) and the other player must play as a Corporation. The Corp attempts to build up assets and security while seeking to thwart the hacker from stealing the goodies. It's a lovely mix of play-styles and strongly fits into Cyberpunk themes and dynamics.

Buy any or all of these Adventure System games, they are simple, fast-playing, co-op (mostly) and above all, FUN!
The game itself is just cards, in a much larger, sturdy cardboard box.  If you have other Gamewright card games, it's the same kind of box you get with Sleeping Queens, Zeus on the Loose, etc.  The game itself doesn't take much space (four cards for each person on the table at a time, plus a draw deck and a discard pile - that's it) so this makes a good game to take with you on vacations, traveling or while visiting friends.  The rules are simple enough to explain and lure others into a game as well.

The coins are very realistic and true to size like real coins.  The only downfall I can really see is that it doesn't take a standard AA or AAA battery.  It takes a 1.5 volt coin type batter. It does auto shut off after a little bit of time though which would save on battery usage.  It's the only reason why I dropped the stars by 1.

There is easily enough strategy that a strategic minded adult would almost always beat a non-strategically minded adult, and that adults will always beat kids in solo play, but team play with teams of adult + kid fixes this problem.  While it may not be strategically deep enough for the very serious strategy gamer, its a total winner for everyone else.

Sounds complicated but its not.  As long as an adult is keeping score, kids as young as 5 (maybe even 4) can pick this up.  In my house, my kids being 6 & 9, we find it most fun to play 2 v 2, with everyone having their own hand, with team members seeing their teammates hand and jointly planning strategy.  While this is mostly because the 6 year old would not be competetive on his own -- and he hasn't learned to like games he always loses -- team play actually does add to the level of strategy.  My six year old can sometimes spot plays that I miss.

Pros:
Just to name a few examples, Vinnie (12) took control of the Imperial Fleet while I took ownership of the Rebel Alliance for our first game.  I had a lot of objective and command cards that did extra damage to enemy objectives.  I found myself able to swoop in and do a lot of damage, though I had to remember to pay attention to each card's special ability to implement them.  Vinnie, on the other hand, had more resources at his disposal and brought in the Devastator (a powerful capital ship) and a TIE Bomber.  He wiped out one objective with a superlaser card and two more with his ships on following turns.  Even though I had Force control throughout the majority of the game, he brought his Death Star tracker from zero to nine in no time flat.  If it wasn't for special abilities and Force priority, I would have lost.

So now let me explain what I mean. The game is  a lot smaller than I actually thought I must admit I didn't read the full description like I normally do when I purchase things online to avoid problems like the one I have concerning this game. Yes it is a tile lock just like the description says it is but Like I said its small, the board....the tiles and even the stand for the tiles seem to be smaller than the original game. I had to go back to look at the box to make sure this wasn't some Junior version to the game like they have for monopoly. That seem to be my only problem I have with the game board other than that it definitely is a tile lock no more of the tiles scattering when we try to make a word. Would I recommend this product yes but beware it is small.

Be prepared for some "heated" discussions!  One thing to note...we added a "house rule" to this game.  We use a die to determine how many train cards to pick instead of only having to pick two train cards.  This makes the game go a little faster...although it is very annoying when someone rolls a "1"!

3840	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	The blurb on the e-wing says it was designed to be better and eventually replace the x-wing but of course it never did because of the cost. I agree with this completely. The maneuvering dial is pretty amazing besting even the imperial tie defender in some ways but the cost on surprisingly low stats cant justify the astronomical price. The e-wing cost between 27-35 squad points while x-wings can come in at 21-29 points a big difference. And yet when you compare the stats x-wings have 3 primary weapon, 2 agility, 3 hull, and 2 shields while e-wings have 3 primary weapons, 3 agility, 2 hull, and 3 shields. So essentially they upped the agility and moved a hull to shields, not really impressed. Personally I find myself reaching for x-wings over e-wings every time, the model is beautiful and the game mechanics are actually pretty good, but I find that the x-wings are more cost affective.
4283	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is definitely a family game and we're glad the logic behind the actions that take place actually makes sense.

Fortunately, the last three-quarters of the book actually functions as a real player's guide, including the basics on how to choose a class, roll up attributes, figuring out ability modifiers, choosing feats and spells, buying weapons and other gear, and learning the basics of combat maneuvers and other functions a beginning player will need to know once they begin a game.  You could have someone read the Hero's Handbook and they would be ready to enter a full game of Pathfinder, save for not knowing a few of the more advanced rules that could be picked up on the fly.  The art styles are bright and vivid with high-quality artwork, and the writing style is equally compelling.  Overall, the Hero's Handbook is a solid resource even after a player has upgraded to the full Pathfinder Core Rulebook.  Overall, I'd give this book a 9/10.

My husband and I played this and an entire game only took about 15 minutes, though I'm sure it would take longer the more people that were playing or if some players were children. You move old school cardboard character cut outs of Rudolph, Clarice, Hermie, or Santa (no Yukon Cornelius sadly)around the board trying to rescue misfit toys before the Bumble can swipe them. You can only collect one of each color as you need 3 toys each of a different color token to win. The youngest player rolls a die to go first and a dvd directs you as to where toys have been cited by King Moonracer or alerts you to the Bumble's trouble making.

Maybe my children and I are different, but finding a way to make the trap "work" is really part of the fun for us. I think it engages my children to observe and analyze and apply thinking skills to contribute in the building and execution of the trap. My 4 year old realized that if he holds down the base of the crank, it won't shift as much and allows for a better launch of the sign into the boot. (if your game is older, the slots in the board tend to get worn out and the bases can shift a bit, holding them down helps stabilize it. You could also just tape or glue the bases into place and put the game in a plastic bin or something instead and only build on top of the bases.)

They are dry until you add water, they can be mixed in the tray without damaging the integrity of the colors,  and there are beautiful pictures with step by step directions to achieve professional looking results. The paints do not stain the face but did leave a hint of color on my daughters inner arm area(where she painted "bracelets") I had a lot of fun with this kit, it was easy to use, and cleanup is simple. I might add that it is compact enough to travel with. Definitely recommend!!

I like that you can start with a basic game where you car just takes general damage.  When you get the hang of that then you can move to advanced rules and eventually add more mechanics to the game.  So in the advanced game you then have to worry about damage to various parts of your car like the engine, tires, body, brakes, etc.  Additional mechanics are described for you to add in your game like weather, slipstreaming, pit stops, multiple laps, etc.

1176	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Our new favorite family board game. A game that is fun, requires thought, planning and is a blast to play. I highly recommend this game for those people who like games such as Power Grid and Risk.
2423	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	My kids LOVE The Elf on the Shelf and have had them since 2008! We currently have 4 elves and 2 reindeer so of course when these came out we had to have them! I'm not sure why they are $25 when the reindeer were priced at $20. They're pricey but everything that is this brand is expensive.
Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).  Although there is no true character design, as the heroes are a predetermined group, with some imagination, there is no reason that you could not design your own hero cards.
9360	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Love this drum! It is so durable and has a great sound. It comes with 2 drumsticks as other reviews have stated, so do not buy an extra drum stick!
It is pretty easy for kids to carry from one room to another using the handle and the parts stay put since they are magnetized to the board.

Since these are a MUST for the SW game, you can feel better with the purchase by knowing that you'll pick up how they work pretty quickly.

9409	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	You wouldn't think this simple, kinda chintzy, game would be a family favorite but it's actually quite fun! The graphics are laughable and the cards are dreadfully thin and flimsy which makes me wonder how durable they will be, but the concept is actually a really smart one. The players work together (which is a refreshing change to the competition aspect of other games) and the idea of having to beat the clock is what makes this so fun. It's essentially a memory game but again, it's the idea of having to find matches before midnight that kinda makes it intense. We play many rounds of this during our family game night. And the secret door is really whimsical. Our daughters like to open it with a resounding "creeeeeeek!" So cute!
The Dark Young manages to vamp on the by-now well-known look of the thing, both keeping true to the overall canonical vision but executing it in a new way. Kudos to the sculptor.
(4) Torun Far, an awesome 6 point upgrade that lets you spend energy to remove focus, evade, and target lock tokens from enemy ships at range 1-2.  Can only be used on huge Rebel ships.

It is made of very sturdy pieces, and each have very easy to read cities/state/landmarks.  It is fabulous.  It takes up more of my kitchen table than I had actually expected, but well worth the placement.  I am thinking I may look for a frame and glue the pieces together and put this on the wall as a map.  I very much recommend this purchase, well worth the $12.99.
5017	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is great for family time with younger children around the age of 7 or so. It requires some thinking ahead and how to place the titles. We love to play this game with our family and my daughter is very competitive and has beat us a couple of times with it. One down side is you can only play up to four people, there are not enough titles to really play more than that. Would be great if they made it where more people could play with more titles. Game is fun!
3) For such a simple game, it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary.  The game is literally in doubt until the last card is played (one of the "special" cards might send a player back to near the start).  This is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons: "NEVER give up".
The price is well worth it!
Have Fun ^_^
2374	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Yep, this game is quite involved and quite detailed - for a boardgame.  But it's not JUST a boardgame.  You can play solo with 1-4 characters, or play with other individuals each commanding one character.  The game has rules for scaling the adventures to the number of players so you'll actually have a chance of winning.  Only a chance, anyway.  Even having lost many games, I still had a great time trying to get my heroes past dark events and combat with strange, fierce monsters!

3207	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this Yogarilla card deck because when I observed my son in school with his occupational therapist, she was using these cars with him.  I couldn't believe my eyes that my ten year old was doing yoga and actually loving it!  I ordered the cards right away and even went ahead and purchased yoga mats for both my children at home.  One thing about my daughter is, if she sees my son doing something, she wants to join in on the fun as well.  They absolutely love Yogarilla and they both come home from school asking if they can do yoga with me.  This is a beautiful card deck, very easy to use, thorough instructions on the back and Otis the gorilla on the front with each individual pose.  They are color coded for certain positions, which is great.  Super easy to use, and I highly recommend them, not just for school use, for parents as well!
This isn't something you'll play every night, but it stays fresh every time you come back to it. We've played 35-45 games so far and aren't close to going through all the cards. However, if you're good at creating proverbs, be prepared for spans of waiting for others to finish up with theirs. If you're the one who is slow, you may get frustrated and start writing stuff down just to complete the round. The game has a simple dedicated theme, but is great especially in creative groups.

In addition to the normal cards, in the deck is a limited amount of Creeper cards, when you get a creeper card, it immediately plays down and you replace the card from the deck.
The only thing I might do differently is buy a "set" of Remo instead of just the one. She doesn't play it very long because well, it doesn't change sounds (unless you place your hand on top, as we've experimented and discovered!), but that has nothing to do with the quality, sound, or durability of this particular drum, which is crazy-good.
Excellent and educational toy.  He should have years of fun playing with it.

Each completed destination card awards points. Failing to complete a destination card removes points. Each completed railroad section awards points (based on the length of the railroad). At the end of the game, the player with the longest continuous railway is awarded bonus points. And of course, the player with the most points wins.
-New building layover strips are GREAT, with or without the new building sheets, because now players have options for buildings not available to other players, which provides different ways to win.

I have been very good at Scrabble for as long as I can remember, but in recent years I've balked at playing with my family during holiday visits.  The flaws of Scrabble should be evident to anyone whose played at least once:  the endless waiting for someone to play their turn, the table-pounding frustration of watching someone take "your spot", the fights over people thumbing through the dictionary to debate bogus word after bogus word, the teeth-grinding stress of building words for the sake of hitting double/triple spots rather than just long words, and so on.  For me, Scrabble is a 3-hour time commitment that is more stress than it's worth.
3688	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	You can't go wrong with this Cosmic encounter expansion! It adds even more replayability to a game that is already almost endless in its' possibilities. If you play with this expansion, I would recommend replacing the aliens in the original game for the first few playthroughs so you get the most out of this experience, and then later on eventually mixing everything together. The chaotic nature of this game is actually what makes it so exciting; you never know who is going to win, even up to the last turn.
This game is for people who love to think. It is awesome for kids, and will help them develop their logic skills. Do have in mind that you will need to place the pegs in bags or they will get lost. Have fun!
5407	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We just played this for the first time and we're hooked.  My 5 year-old can play, but strategy is a little beyond her.  The 9 year-old completely gets it, and both my husband and I thought it was great.  I love that it's so simple and easy to pick up-- just a bunch of solid wooden tiles in a canvas bag.  Kind-of like an abstract version of Scrabble.  Lots of fun.  As simple or as complicated as you want it to be!
Controlling the monolith earns you special cards that can DEVISTATE your opponent/s. If this is your first time playing - RUN TO THE CENTER AND HOLD IT!.
APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE: Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a "warm-up" between their more complicated gaming sessions. It's also a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games.

9027	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	The original Rush Hour is still much more fun.  The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak.  The puzzles are not as challenging overall, yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories (junior, beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Also, the build quality is poorer, as a few of the train pieces don't sit properly on the board, and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards, a sore point for a young boy.

549	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Although I read the rules that came with this game, my son and I made some rules of our own, that I think are most appropriate to his level of current knowledge, and that I think can best help him learn from playing with these cards.  If we only have 20 minutes, that's enough time to have some fun with this.
5846	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Got this by request for one of the grand daughters.  I ordered several different topics. They have been a big hit, and it is interesting to see what all shows up in the picture as you complete the progression of dots by the number.  It is quite surprising! All to the good, no bad surprises.  Nice when traveling, nice when she just wants some quiet time. I find she will work for a while, then lay it down, and come back later to work again.  It was a good choice.

1517	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My wife and I enjoy games -- usually more of the thinking kind -- risk, scrabble, etc.  This game kept popping up, so I gave it a shot.  You can learn it in 5 minutes, but it is a blast.  Lots of strategy (which I am still ironing out) and a enough luck to change things up every time you play.  I would definitely recommend the 1910 expansion pack, though!
We'll definitely pull this one out again next time.  Thank you Mitchell in VA for reviewing the game!
1877	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Good
The game, like many CCGs where it originally came from, can sometimes be won or lost by one of the players having a lot of bad draws. The nice part about it losing the CCG format is this happens less. However, it can still occur, but since the game usually runs 30 minutes you're not out too much, and you can just try again.
9980	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have a 10 month old grandson and a 3 1/2 year old grandson and I wanted something for both boys to be able to play with either by themselves or together.  The Fun Tube is just the right toy for this.

They play wonderfully together with the Fun Tube!!

1216	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the best easy to learn games out there, and nobody I've introduced it to has ever been disappointed.  It is simple to learn, but there is still a lot of strategy, which is the best thing that can be said about a game.  I'm looking forward to playing it with my kids when they get a bit older.
The game is well made and illustrated with interesting detail. It is very simple to play with nothing to read, so even younger children can enjoy this game. While it is basically a memory game- you turn over tiles and  try to match them, there is an element of urgency since you are working together against the clock (grandfather clock tiles) to find all matches.

I will rate this game 4.5 stars out of 5. It took at least 5 game plays to fully understand the rules and still a couple of folks in my gaming group don't get them. In general, a great game. Just make sure you have lots of snacks by your side as this can take about 3 hours or more from start to finish. Also, having a group that is willing to spend that much time is a also crucial. This is definitely not for the average gamer out there.

Rebecca Kyle, February 2009
Let's just say this, the game is supposed to last around 45 minutes, but it was over in 20. I love it and I think it's great fun. It has some trivia you answer by the other reading a card and other questions are answered by watching video clips. Overall, I would recommend this game to those that want to play alone or with other Trek fans. If you are the only Trek fan playing, you may be the only one that has fun.

The kids are enjoying looking for the elf every morning not cowering.  The book is OK.  Its main benefit is providing the back story for the elf, why it is around the house and some ground rules (such as no touching or back to the North Pole I go).  I liked how the story was written in a way that encouraged positive behaviors without a big brother is watching you vibe.

Pros:
With a good mix of players and perspectives, you'll get a big range of completed proverbs, ranging from Confucius worthy to a simple phrase that fools everyone. If you can't think of anything, you can also create something ridiculous to make it impossible for the reader to read without laughing. We've had a lot of fun playing this in several different family or friends groups, including several international groups. The proverbs come from cultures all over the world, and are often interesting and spark further conversation.

4) Hand-eye coordination gets some practice.  The pieces are little pegs, and they fit into slots on the game board.  This makes the counting easier and guides players to put their token in the proper slot.  The act of putting the peg in the slot can be a challenge for little hands, but generally, if a child can do the counting, he or she probably has enough dexterity to move the pieces.  (You WILL, by the way, eventually lose a piece or two.  Luckily, almost any bit of colored plastic can be substituted.)

At a most basic level, this game introduces the young mind to the concept of "games".  "Games" have "rules" and "winners".  This is quite a hurdle to jump for a young child (especially an autistic child), yet it is essetial that they jump it.  And, thankfully my kids did!

6063	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Our group was looking at other options to include for game night and I happened to find this one based on a few online recommendations / videos.  The game is a lot of fun, but make sure your group has at least some interest in 'racing'.  One reason this game caught my attention was the amount of people who could actually be involved.  The game comes with some really fun manual-shifting boxes that add a different feel and conversation when playing.  Everyone wanted to get to the highest gear quickly but found they were taking damage quickly.  This game also comes with 2nd track on the backside for more city-style driving and slightly different rules.  We haven't gotten around to trying that side out yet.  When opened... this game is huge and draws a lot of attention.

The first time you open the box to this game you will be amazed at the amount of color and artistic images that are included. There are over hundred tokens, and the civilization cards all have a great drawing of a famous leader belonging to each civilization. This game has over 10 map tiles that each have 9 squares of different land types that look very artistic and beautiful. Images are also included on all of the military cards to represent all of the unit types including infantry, artillery, calvary, and aircraft. Each of these things may not make up entirely for the great graphics and animations you will find in the civilization video game, but they do a pretty good at transferring the video game's visuals into a board game.
Theme- The theme isn't bad, but it does need a bit of work.  I like the world this game is in.  It's in the same world as Belford, and I like the way that place looks and feels.  It's almost like the Discworld.  Also, the unique player cards do bring some story the game with all the cards have flavor text on them. That's a good addition to a card game that adds a bit more theme to a semi dry concept of buying property and market manipulation.  Overall, it does feel like I'm a real-estate mogul in a fantasy world, but some of the simplifications does take away a bit from the theme.  This game is good, but it's not Arkham Horror levels of emersion. 4.25/5

Most matching games feature a maximum of 48 cards (24 matches).  Those cards are flimsy and are not likely to survive childrens enthustic play.  Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game features 72 cards (36 matches); these cards are made of heavy card stock that is approximately 1/16 thick.  The number of matches you choose to use when playing this game can vary depending on the childs age and memory skills.  The box is also very sturdy; it closes using a magnetic flap rather than being a conventional two-piece unit.  Plastic dividers keep the cards organized inside the box.

That in a nutshell is how you play the game. Now, for my thoughts and review of the game. For starters, I love that this is a card game. It is portable and fits in your pocket, so you can take it with you wherever you go. Secondly, the rules aren't overly complicated. I know I wrote a lot about it, but after you play through it once, it makes sense what you can and can't do, and the learn curve is very shallow. Third, I LOVE the theme for this game. In the gaming world, there are a lot of themes that are overused including general fantasy, zombies, and H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulu for some reason. There aren't a great deal of time travel games, so this is a gem. So I recommend when you're playing the game, take your time. Read the characters. Read the different cards. There was a lot of thought and effort that went into each of these cards, the backstories of the characters, and the alternate histories. It's not only creative, but it's a very clever game of hypotheticals. How would the world be different if Lincoln hadn't of been assassinated or if the Titanic wouldn't have sunk? The results aren't always good in the game. In fact, you might end up triggering World War III.

Each player draws cards for their destinations and then chooses other cards for the appropriate paths to the destination. Points are earned for the various trips and moves. Lots of pieces (trains)are needed to play and can't be lost so I marked it a little down on durability. Good for learning maps, math, and making choices. The older ones used strategies to block each other but the younger ones were content with making it to the right city. Everyone kept very attentive and wanted to play again and again.

Ticket to Ride is easy to teach and learn, fun to play over and over again, and doesn't take too long to get through (most games lasting under an hour).  The game doesn't suffer from a lot of random chance (e.g. no dice rolling) and relies on player planning and skill to win.  There is the option to go after other players and have a pretty cut-throat game, but that is not necessary to gameplay if it is not your style.

Also, some pages are pretty hard for him since he is only two (like matching flowers when all the options are red and yellow - could only tell them apart by the petals/center sizes).

He was always in a different place in the morning. At first the things "Jingle" did were pretty cute; making the toilet paper into a snow man, writing notes to my child in cute backwards handwriting...but then things started to get strange. The first morning that I became concerned was when I found him in my daughters bathroom in front of the mirror that had writing on it. I expected it to say something cute like "It's almost Christmas" or "Happy Holidays!" but what I found was "REDRUM". Being horror movie fans, I just chalked it up to him trying to mess with my husband and I and told my daughter that he was just being silly. But then the next morning, I found something VERY disturbing. Jingle was sitting in my daughters floor with one of her barbies in A NOOSE. After this occurred I told my daughter I thought it was time to send Jingle back to the North Pole and ask Santa for a new elf. She was confused but said okay. So I took the elf and tossed him in the dumpster at our apartments and went to Target to purchase a new one. Due to being freaked out over the elf I had received I purchased a girl one this time. That night I showed my child her new Elf on a Shelf and she named her "Lulu Bell". That evening I placed Lulu Bell in the Christmas tree and the next morning she was still there! I was elated that I had finally gotten a normal elf and that Jingle was gone. I went to bed that next night after putting Lulu Bell on the couch with a book on her lap and the next morning I woke up to my daughter screaming. I ran into the living room to find Lulu Bell on the floor with what I assumed was ketchup on her neck and there beside her was Jingle, with a butter knife in his hand and "ketchup" on it as well. I quickly called Amazon and informed them of the situation and then I found out, they had never sent me an elf because the one I wanted was on back order....

6039	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Games like Formula D are a perfect example of the importance of theme in a game. At a fundamental level, there isn't much of a difference between this game and Chutes and ladders. You roll a dice and you move. Of course there are things like different dice that correspond to the gears in a car, points that correspond to things like engine, brakes and tires that wear out as the race progresses. These are the things that mechanically make the game different. But the theme of being in a race with up to 9 friends is what makes it fun. We've been racing each other since we could crawl so a race to the finish line is the most natural thing to anyone, even if they don't play board games. A game takes less than an hour and rules can be explained in less than 10 minutes. The board has 2 sides that feature different tracks and has advanced rules once you want to bump the complexity a bit. A great game for groups or family but plays well with even a few players.
There are new counters made from the nice chunky card of the original game; Inserts for the monsters, a new kind of puzzle which challenges the keeper (yes, you read that right) rather than the players, allies which may throw in with investigators for a time, more wound counters and more sanity counters (including some much-needed "five brains" counters). There are some additions to the "tile features" counters - the boat and two different kinds of pitfall.

Some times the smaller words will bring the most points! We have 2 sets now! I keep one at work to play at lunch. Yes you can play solitaire!

The biggest change is the concept of "fate" as an attribute.  Each character gets a Fate value along with his others.  These are basically re-rolls that can be used to re-roll a single die OF YOUR OWN.  It adds a twist to the game and will speed it up.

6314	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My 3 year old LOVES technology! She loves to play on the computer, kindle, smartphones, and her LeapPad Ultra. She is a big fan of anything touchscreen. She can figure out technology faster than most adults - this day in age, huh? I was really happy when I was asked to review Painting Lulu because it looked like it would be right up her ally! Painting Lulu is essentially a 3-in-1 activity book. The Meet Lulu book is 32 pages made from 100% recycled paper. Your child can color and draw in it just like any normal activity book. In addition to this, you should download the Painting Lulu app on your Kindle, iPad, or iPhone. You child can use this app just as any other coloring app. Meet Lulu comes with a super cute and fun crayon stylus! My daughter loved using this to color in the app on our iPhone! She thought it was the coolest thing ever! Each page in the book has a QR code so you can scan it (using any QR scanner app) and create a blank coloring page. You can also use the Painting Lulu app to take a photo of a colored page and add to it using the app. The activity book itself features all recyclable items as the characters which I am a huge fan of. We recycle everything we can in this house and I love that this drives it home for my daughter! Painting Lulu also has a one-click share feature so your child can share their creations with family and friends! Overall, this product is really cool and I think a lot of kids will like it! I know coloring is a favorite pastime in our house with two little kids and this puts a new spin on it. My daughter has been using the crayon stylus since it came. She enjoyed using it to color a LeapPad Ultra app that she has (Scout and Friends).

 I hate to tell you what to do but
9951	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This was an inspired choice of Easter gift from my mother to my four year old son. I must admit I was horrified when it arrived, but we diligently set it up and used the included coupon to apply for the cup of caterpillars. When they arrived they were tiny and barely moving - I thought they were dead. They slowly started moving more and more. Then one day we thought one of them had been eaten by the others! He was all in chunks!! Turned out that was the first time they shed their skins. They kept doing it, until they were enormous. I shuddered whenever i saw them, they were so disgusting. But my son was busy reading the national geoepgraohic live cycle book my mother had sent him (I reccomend getting this) collecting them leaves, and tending to his caterpillars. Eventually they grew very big and started building their chrysalis's. Still disgusting!! We then rearranged the cup lid so they hung down from it. Then yesterday we watched as five beautiful butterflies emerged. My son was delighted! It was truly incredible, their crumpled wings opened up and slowly turned from brown to beautiful colors. We fed them pineapple, watermelon and orange and they all feasted. This morning we collected fresh flowers for their breakfast, then went outside and set them free. They emerged one by one and did huge shaky loops of the garden as they tried out their wings for the first time. They soared around us in bigger and bigger loops - it was incredible.
7.) Time and Players: The game runs quickly, because the decisions are important, but don't bog the game down to much. I was impressed with how well the game scaled, but found that the two-player game was much different than a five-player one. Both were fun, but needed different tactics.
When we need a change of pace, we like to divide all the tiles evenly, and then choose a theme like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Trying to make every word match the theme is much less fast-paced, but makes for a super fun challenge.  =)

5144	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoy playing this.  I do recommend it and think families will have fun with it.
I find games like this a waste of time for me though.  If I'm going to invest countless hours into a single play, I want my decisions to have a large impact on the outcome.  This game does not provide that.
8941	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We have had these dolphins for years.  My two year old LOVES them.  If the note isn't sounding clear you can blow all the water out of the dolphin and then it is clear.  It's true that they don't link together very well, but we don't do that very much.  One thing I should share: don't boil them!  I boiled mine to clean them and now they look cracked and faded.

8219	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game was recently updated to include stupid things like a cell phone, a green gas cloud coming out the back end and a toilet. Seriously? I feel like I'm living in the movie "Idiocracy" where everyone giggles every time reference is made to farts or butts. It took me some time, but I finally found a CLASSIC version sold by amazon. There is still one change from when I was a kid in the 80's - they've added an ice cream cone in Sam's head for "brain freeze." This version, unlike the "gas" version, still comes with the "operation" cards and money. This is apparently something that was done away with in the newer version. Love the classic game, it works beautifully and I would buy it again.

8890	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Created in 1906 as an alternative "card" game for those who believed that regular cards were sinful and of the devil, Rook is a game that people of all ages will enjoy playing. My family has played Rook since I was a very young child and I've never gotten tired of playing the game. I've enjoyed playing the game with my grandparents, aunts, and uncles as well as college students. There are several different styles of game play, depending on the number of people you have (2-6) and depending on how challenging you want the game to be. Rook is a great game for families to play and I recommend it to anyone looking for something a little bit different from the norm.
9419	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	As a homeschool family I bought this to help my son learn his multiplication tables. The product is good over all but it would be better if the answers showed up clearer when the button is pushed. The answer is a little hard to see.
Overall, this is a fun, highly competitive card game that takes some patience starting out but holds plenty of entertainment value and does justice to the GoT theme.
8907	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My 18m Grandson loves it. He bangs it very hard, throws, sits and stands on it. Very sturdy. Sounds good. More than a toy drum. Would highly recommend.
I got rid of it in a yard sale for $2. I hate the new versions of old classics.

All in all this is great.  The races have been alway tight for us.  No one has been left in the dust and felt hopeless.  We always have had a mad dash to the finish line.  I definitely recommend this game as well as the expansion tracks.

the packaging is great, perfect to display, or if you want to open, its completely collector friendly, which is a huge plus to me
Simply stated, Infiltration is completely flat and lifeless. I feel nothing towards it and I intend on selling it soon. Players don't care about the characters and the way the game is tailored players don't care who wins the game. Sadly I feel no sadness when I kill a company worker in the building and some innocent employee getting "knocked-off"? (Is that necessary? Most thieves aren't interested in murder on top of their stealing crimes). In Infiltration there is no greater alliances with other players and no consequences to almost anything. And when you don't care who wins and when you the player is dead to the circumstances, why play it?
The E-Wing is as powerful as an X-Wing (3), more agile (3) and has stronger shield (3), but less hull (2). It is as maneuverable as an X-Wing with a straight speed up to 5, perform a Koiogran turn at speed 4 and 3 at a cost of stress, but has green turn at speed 2 instead of 1.
I thought I understood pain.  As a former attendee of the high school educational regimen, an attendee who was not terribly liked nor disliked, I thought I understood apathy.  Demoralization.  These feelings are mere constructs when laid bare against the foundation of Brimstone, they facsimiles of an emotion which is only a shadow-sliver of its true strength.  As a frequenter of the streets of Arkham, I have become hardened against the potential dark waiting with its maw and its suckers and its gaping hate, and in those things I find no fear.  Only resolve.  But in Brimstone, in the mines outside the dust of an old west town where inspired abominations pull at the fabric of our world, my will was tested.  It was broken.  There is no love for my avatar now.  No bond forged by tribulation.  Having suffered defeat upon defeat in the face of these eldritch terrors, I dash my pawn willingly against the beach of that sharp shore, thinking not of their sacrifice, but of my lust for revenge.
The next phase is the Arkham Encounter Phase. Depending on where you investigator is, you will be on a street (between locations) or on a location. If you are in a street, nothing occurs. If you are on a location, then there is either a gate on the location or there isn't. If there's no gate, you shuffle that particular location's deck and draw a card and resolve it; sometimes it will help your character out with some cash or a spell, and sometimes it will spawn a monster on you or drain your sanity! If there's a gate on the location, you have to go through the gate and go to the other world on the gate token, or you have to try to close the already explored gate (someone has already gone through it and returned).
On an alternative "game" side of it...my six-year-old daughter and I like creating a giant grid of related words.  Since Bananagrams comes with TONS of usable letters, it's easy to make a lot of words, great and small ~ perfect for a little cutie pie whose spelling vocabulary is growing :)

We purchased that one at a Scholastic sale so unfortunately it did not have the spiral binding. This is important because there are pages that need to be photocopied or scanned and printed and the book binding does not lend itself to this.
Overall, we found this a relaxed game, probably best for teens and adults. There's not much strategy and we didn't notice any educational opportunities. Our most competitive players were a bit disappointed in the game, since there's not much you can do to improve or to plan ahead. The movie clips were funny, though, and it's easy to socialize while you play.
6655	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Our little one is just under three months old now and is getting more and more interested in this rattle.  The ribbed rods are perfect for her to grab with her little hands, and the large openings allow her to safely put her whole arm through the toy to "wear" it.  She's fascinated by the bright colors and sharp rattling sound that the beads make - I can distract her from fussing by shaking it in front of her eyes.  She's also starting to mouth the toy and even though it's hard plastic it doesn't seem to bother her in the least.  All in all, this is a great value for $10!
2240	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	These are good. Not a game at all though. Just cards with two questions to chose from as each person draws a card. Some interesting, some super easy (what's your favorite color?), some can provide interesting conversations. We use it at dinner time.

She loves punching the numbers in, but her favorite part is the open button that ejects the spring loaded drawer. I put the coins away until she is older, because I fear she will choke on them. She loves the paper money and the pretend credit card. I can see her and my son playing with this toy for at least 10 more years. It is very durable. She has dropped it many times and it hasn't skipped a beat. The plastic is high quality. I would definitely buy this product again.

There are plenty of familiar concepts, but they're all filtered through the Game Of Thrones mindset  rather than tapped or untapped for instance you have kneeling and standing.

(You could just google the rules and play with your scrabble tiles too.)
3612	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Fate Core (which is absolutely necessary for this product, introduced a refined RPG system that focuses on story above all else. Your characters are tough and are nearly-unkillable but the can be maimed to the point of uselessness and it might be time to make a new character while your old one retires to a background character or a source of quests for revenge due to their injuries. Fate allowed players and the GM to create worlds and scenarios together leading to a great overall understanding of the universe everyone was playing in and the broad and simple rules made it a snap to learn. The big rub was that SOME things NEEDED depth, how magic works, how cybernetic enhancements would change characters, and the negative aspect of using too much of these things with one character. While Fate Core touched on how to balance stuff like this, the Fate System Toolkit refines it and offers much easier source material to fine craft the universe you and your players game in. Not only a good GM tool, the System Toolkit is best shared with players to get a good idea on how to handle the game more fluidly.

I enjoy using this kit with the "Haiku" word kit tiles because the natural, peaceful themes are compatible.
my son is four and love this game - its even fun/challenging for adults
The quality is top-notch.  The tiles are two-sided, and each of the sets contains numerous add-ons that allow nearly endless varieties of terrain for encounters.
The game takes time to learn, but it's a lot less complex than Magic: The Gathering. Because it's a LCG, the initial expenditure to have a competitive deck is much less. So that makes it more newbie-friendly than Magic. It's an excellent game, with extensive replayability. The addition of expansion packs will further increase its longevity -- again at a far more reasonable price than for Magic. The game's graphics are excellent -- neon and noir -- done in exciting comic-book style.

Con...The pilots/cost. It is a bit of a challenge to field effectively. This was to be the ATF of SnV but, like the E and Defender, it comes out a bit squadron cost pricey. Guri seems to see the most use, any pilot who had an ability that grants effectively an action is usually worth it, and she pairs well as a Mindlinked elite. Keep an eye out in the future though, this ship being a bit too expensive for what it does might get fixed. I expect FFG will do something akin to the cannon/primary weapon TIE Defender title when SNV eventually gets a veterans or aces box set.
There are no catch up mechanisms in place in this game, so someone can run away with it, but its a game where you can always claw for second place.  That is, you're personal economy will never be destroyed beyond repair leaving you sitting watching everyone else at the table rejoice in spoils.  I find a lot of satisfaction being able to claw for second place myself.  This is because I, like you have the ability to synthesis happiness.

Pros:
Then you move your spaces according to the rules of the game.  It's pretty easy stuff - except for the questions.  They are hard!  I consider myself a movie buff but I have learned since playing this game that I need to brush up on my comedies!

Played at least 1 game with all beginner characters and read the descriptions for almost all of the harder characters.  All of the characters are so unique, you never run into a character in which you think "Oh he is just another tank" or "This guy is just too strong".  Most situations you look at a character and describe them as a tank, but they also do so many other things that it's kind of hard to call them a tank after reading into them.

My son is 9 months so I applied sunscreen as well as used the tent. I purchased a battery powered fan to help with the airflow during the summer and put it outside of the tent. I also put a few heavier toys in the corners both for play and to help with the tent as it seemed to be light and I didn't want it to blow away. For the price of the tent you can't expect it to be perfect but it assembles in less then 5 minutes and it is small and lightweight and easily stored in the vehicle so you have it when you need it.

I read others thoughts on this game. I do have to agree that if you have never played a living card game before than it will take a lot of patience to learn all of the rules. You will probably have to refer to them many times through out the play of the game to remember what step is next.

Very funny quotes, and it will trip you up - in one quote, it will be a very normal ending; the next one will be weird.  So players can't get comfortable thinking "oh, I will always just pick the odd one" - as the answers are not consistent.  People were crying with laughter, and it just got better as it went on, as we would refer back to previous answers.  GREAT game.  LOTS of cards - and I don't think anyone had to "pass" on any card, as each one had at least one quote players could work with.

Rules
The body parts come all attached on one piece of plastic so you will need to remove these before play can commence. I would also recommend a ziplock bag to keep the money and doctor/specialist cards in as there is no compartment in the game. The playing board measures approximately 8 3/4" x 15".

Opened up on X-mas, was so surprised when he seen all the contents, and mapping.  3 days after the shock of the Wii wore off we started playing during his winter break.  Now play at least once a week.  He is getting better with the strategy of the game and point scoring.  Can play in a short period of time, moves along fast once you learn how to play.  It is a little more expensive then average board game, feel that is well worth it.

I feel like the game assumes that by playing all your tiles you can go through the bag while filling your opponents stock with tiles they can't play as quickly.  Except the first time you play you quickly realize that having a single tile isn't always as easy to play as a handful.  Plus the game gives you the ability to ditch a tile at any time and trade it in for 3 more.  It's just a nonsensical game where just happening to play the last tile wins you the game by a fraction of a second each time.
5482	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My kids (ages 3 and 5) love the Rudolph DVD Game.  It works in much of the same way as a regular Scene It Game but it is simplified so that even my 3 year old can get the answers right.  My kid's have watched Rudolph a few times but you don't need to know the movie to play this game (although it makes it fun to know the character's names).  We did not play with the game board because I found it too confusing for younger children.  We just played with the DVD and did not keep score.  The DVD would show a scene and then ask a question related to the scene.  An adult really needs to supervise for younger children who aren't familiar with the DVD remote control.  My kid's really enjoyed it.  The only problem I had was with the game board which was divided into 4 sections - my kid's couldn't really get the concept of it and I found it a little difficult to understand myself.  Overall, a fun game.
Also: The trim is very sensitive and hard to get set. It will go off in one direction quickly if you don't get it right.  Just do one click at a time and then fly for a few seconds because if you give it multiple clicks at once it will quickly veer off in the other direction.

Really easy to get started, clean up, take camping or on vacations etc. 5 stars (:
Each category has challenges and appeals to different different people like guessing characters based on clues, or identifying movies based on scenes. The most fun though was the competitions (all plays) to see which team could guess movie or character FIRST based on the audio clips, scenes, characters, clues, etc..  For some reason those audio clues were especially exciting.
I'm writing this after playing my first game of Sons of Anarchy Men of Mayhem. I'm not a hardcore board gamer and neither is my girlfriend and friends. We do play some games lIke Catan, Pandemic, Ticket To Ride and some newer games like Dead of Winter, Betrayal at the House on the Hill (since the Tabletop show). I saw that this game was on sale for $25 and looked it up and the ratings were pretty positive.
Rating: 5 out of 5 stars if you play the Imperial Assault miniature game; 0 out of 5 for anyone else.

I really enjoy playing Dungeon Roll.  The quality of components are great and the theme really works well.  The heroes and their special abilities really make the game for me as they provide unique strategies depending on your character.  Dungeon Roll is just a great light dice game that can be taught and played very quickly.  The base game doesn't really have much as far as player interaction is concerned, but I think most players will enjoy watching to see what other players choose to do as well.  Now, with 3 or 4 players, the down time between turns lengthen and may result in people not enjoying the game as much.  The game fits well for a nice 2 player game as one player can always be rolling dice (either as the hero or the dungeon lord).  The game does have a large element of luck and that keeps the game different and challenging in its own way, but this may keep some gamers away that don't like a large element of luck in a game to mess up all their perfectly contrived strategies.  The game retails around $19.95, so the price point is nice too.  I am really looking forward to playing the Winter Promo pack and I can't wait to learn more about what they have in store for Dungeon Roll this year (I'm hearing that there will be some great things coming out).  If you like dice games and you are OK with a large luck element and dungeon fighting theme, I think you should get it!  I'm giving this game 4 Fingers Up or 9/10 Stars and that is How Lou Sees It!

I had bought this game for kids at a day care years ago and they liked it too.
Cons:
While the game is great; the packaging and card quality can be improved upon. Each card is a thick cardboard (similar in thickness to the "Game of Life" tiles) with the images printed on. This made the cards a little difficult to shuffle, and with children being a bit rough with this game, sometimes the images start peeling off. Also, for 75 cards, they're being packaged in a large square box, the cards take up less than 1/4 of the space.

9948	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a functional play tent for our little ones (have a two and a half year-old and one-year-old twins) and for the most part, we're liking it. Set-up is a snap and takes maybe 5 minutes. The tent itself holds its shape well and the included pad provides decent padding on the floor of the tent. The only issue we have with it is that there's not much weight to it and if only one child is in there and stands up, they could actually tip it over (luckily it was within arm's reach). We've largely taken care of that by adding additional padding underneath the included pad and positioning, but it would have been nice to know about beforehand. All-in-all, it's a nice play tent for the price and fun for the little ones.
I can't recommend this enough.  And even if you've played before it comes with some great card-board figure holders, it comes with a map that is dry-erase friendly, and it comes with a set of dice!

If you guess correctly you get points, if you are wrong, you lose points. Each round you increase the number of cards you get, so it becomes more difficult to guess.

6388	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Got this for my daughter for Christmas (2 year old) and she loves it.  She's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time.  She loves putting little treasures in here and taking them all over the place.  The size of the box is like that of a metal lunch box.  Big enough for a toddler.  We haven't had any problems with it and it is quite durable for a play date.
The only negative is a so-so construction of this version of the game.  It works out fine.  The pegs do not all fit int he compartment, so I have to keep emptying some before storage and adding them back when we play.  The small scoring pegs can intermix with the larger code pegs if you aren't careful and will have to dig through the larger peg section to separate them.  The smaller scoring pegs do not fit easily into the holes.  It should be easier to insert and remove.  The pegs are either inconsistently created or the holes are not precise.  A few large pegs had small heads too which seemed strange, although not a problem.  The compartment for the code maker is nice in that you can flip it down to expose the code when it is solved, but it is a little tough to get the pegs in there with the shield in the way and out when you are done.  Also there is no way to completely cover the code if you want to walk away, so it is just the honor system.
5480	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Rather than stealing Rudolph's family, in this game, Bumble decides to steal the misfit toys. It's up to players to rescue the toys before Bumble gets six of them. Going around the physical game board, when a player lands on a toy in one of four different sections, s/he gets to play one of nine different mini games on the included DVD, randomly chosen. If successful, that player wins one of the misfit toy tokens (needing to eventually win three out of four different colors). The games are a mix of extremely easy to slightly challenging. This helps add to the ability for children through adults to play. One (Sled Race) requires a guess, so that all ages have an equal chance to win it. However, anyone who has watched the film many times will find four of the games easier to play than those who haven't, and adults will generally have an advantage over younger players. The games include identifying the voice of a main character, making a correct match (a memory game), and guessing which box Charlie is in after it has been shuffled about. The mini games are entertaining enough that it would be nice to be able to access them alone on the DVD, without having to play the board game, or be able to choose which ones to play--but you can't.

I love to play trading card games, but the time and expense are just too much for me theses days. FFG's Living Card Games are nice cause I can get my fix at a much lower cost, and if I do feel the need to expand, I can buy add-ons that I know exactly what I'm getting. If it sounds like you are  in a similar boat, I encourage you to try out this or the futuristic Netrunner; both great games in my opinion.
There are a lot of kids who at my son's age already don't believe. i think this is a shame. You never get back this time in your life when you believe in magic and elves and Santa Claus.

The Pete the Cat series is a favorite at our house and we thought including this doll with one of the books would be a great introduction to the series.  To date, I haven't found a single child who doesn't love Pete the Cat and his catchy tunes. As a mom, the books are equally fun to read.  And they are great for children just learning to read as well.  You won't find a more fun introduction to reading!

3241	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	"Shadow Over Innsmouth" is one of my favorite H.P. Lovecraft stories, and this expansion was a must-have for me. Extra monsters are always nice to add. The extra characters are also great, 16 this expansion!. The 96 personal story cards adds to the base game a lot of characterisation for the investigators. More Ancient Ones - 8 with this expansion! - are also very cool. The board also neat; I imagine the smell of rotting wood beside the sea every time I look at it. This is a neat expansion, I prefer it over Kingsport.
For example, in Fate Core, you start off with a high concept aspect (what your character is all about), a trouble aspect (a running theme of problems for your character), and a regular aspect (just something about your character flesh them out a little) and you can get up to two more as the game progresses. Aspects are invoked for all kinds of reasons by the player as long as they are relevent in some way to the task at hand. For example, if my high concept was 'Internationally known strong man' I can invoke this aspect to a bonus to get into a crowded bar because I am famous, I can invoke it to perform a feat of strength, or the DM can use it against me by making it difficult me for me to not call attention to myself because so many people know me. With 3 aspects it is great for beginners to learn the basics of how to invoke these aspects and it limits all the stuff the GM has to keep up with for random invoking and such when he is new. 5 is solid for advanced players who are into a pretty epic game with established characters and DM who knows what he doing really well.

After it was finally put together, our daughter immediately jumped into it.  The only thing is that most 18 month olds can't figure out how to move with it - so you have to push them.  Eventually - in 2 weeks, she figured out how to move backwards, but I don't think she has enough leg stregnth to move it forward yet.  The other thing is that the space below (where the feet come through) is kind of wide, and she sometimes gets stuck down there.  She is getting better with it.  When her friends come over - they all fight over it (18 - 3 yrs old - especially the boys).  The colors are bright, and the steering wheel moves and has a honking sound (and it also has a little toy storage area in the back).  Our daughter likes it when we push her around, while she "talks" on her daddy's old cell phone.  She still plays with it, but I think she will enjoy it more once she can move it forward on her own.

7120	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	The timeless game for toddlers.
The graphic designers have gone to a great deal of trouble to make the book look like a work-in-progress, with notes from "Billy" the RPG designer and "Harry" a playtester, and with the occasional aside from "Bob". Sometimes this stuff clarifies a rule, much as a sidebar would in any other rulebook. Sometimes they are simply running in-jokes.


The third thing a player may do is play cards to place their train cars on the board. A player may play one through six cards of the same color (including wild cards), to place the same amount of train cards on a corresponding line on the board. For example, Las Vegas is connected to Salt Lake City by an orange line consisting of three spaces. Three orange cards must be played to put three trains of that player's color on those spaces. No more players could then place anything between those two cities, and if players want to connect those two cities with their lines, they'll have to go around the long way (if possible). Gray lines can have any color cards played to place trains on them, but the cards played must match the number of spaces in the gray line, and all of the cards must be the same color. When placing trains, the player doing so receives points - 1 point for one train placed, 2 points for two trains, 4 points for three trains, 7 points for four, 10 points for five, and 15 points for six trains. Some cities have two lines connecting them, both of which can be used in a four or five-player game. In a two or three-player game, however, once one of these lines has been used, the other cannot.

This game has three strong qualities which recommend it to small children.  The first is simplicity, so that the child can easily understand it and start playing immediately.  The second is luck, so that the child has a fair chance against older siblings, babysitters, parents, grandparents and the family cat.  The third is repetition, so that the child can grasp the basic structure of such games and be prepared for those board games that are rites of passage down the road as they mature.  As an added bonus, "Chutes & Ladders" certainly helps young children learn their numbers.
I own a number of the variants and they are all similarly great and each has it's own quirkiness making it easy to enjoy them all. (I keep a copy in my car, a copy in my house, and a copy in my "games night" bag)

1320	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	It needs changes in four of its rules, and reminds me of Risk, where I could potentially lose friends.  The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board.  Since I stopped playing this game, I bought Seven Wonders, which is WAY more interesting, and has no possible avenues for irritation. I did make one mistake in my review.  This game deserves ZERO stars instead of 1!!  I gave this game away, and couldn't get it out of my house fast enough!

Harbour is a light game of dock working in a fantasy realm.  It's not a long game and can be played in about 30 minutes.  It's a great filler game but the depth of gameplay makes it so much more than just that.  The artwork is great and pretty humorous.  I love the look and feel of every aspect of the game from the theme to the design.  The box is a bit small and barely fits all the pieces but who cares really.  At least you're not paying for tons of air space and very little game.  The game isn't difficult and can easily be taught to pretty much anyone.  The extra bonus cards and expansion add quite a bit of strategy to the game that even the most hardcore gamers will enjoy.  Fans of games like Smash Up, Village and Epic Resort will most likely enjoy this one as well.  It's a great game that I highly recommend.  Don't miss the boat on this one.

8391	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	We had an older version of this game from when I was younger but we've lost some pieces over the years. We re-ordered it for the kids and it's pretty much the same. The board itself has been "updated" with some newer graphics than the original release and the mice look pretty dumb, but the game-play is still the same and so is the trap itself, with the exception of using two heavy marbles now instead of one heavy marble and one larger, plastic ball. I have to say I much prefer the larger ball to sit on top of the 'helping hands' because half the time the first marble doesn't jar the hand enough to send the second marble rolling. And sometimes, even when it does roll off it's platform, it doesn't actually fall through the hole in the bathtub and you have to give it a push. The kids don't care, but I don't remember that being a problem in the original set.

"Trouble" is definitely habit-forming, and this is only magnified when you get four people to play.  I've been around people who get so competitive (myself included sometimes) that they will literally pound that little plastic bubble that determines how many spaces you get to move.  And it doesn't matter how many times you warn them, pounding the plastic bubble is not good for the game (especially when it is your bubble they are pounding!).

As a reviewer, you may not think much of this needed change.  But the company has not realized that the "on"/"off" switch is not that.  It is one way or the other on either side, and then in the middle is the "off" mode.  (On the left of the toy, there is a switch for fast or slow".) I would have to guess that 75 percent of the purchase of this toy is from people with autistic children or therapists for such.  That being said, the "on"/"off" switch should be just that, a choice between "off" and "on".  My two (autistic) sons are never able to figure this switch out.  And they are far away from each other on the spectrum as far as the disorder is concerned.  Other than that, batteries last long and the toy gets much use.  Thanks for hearing me out.

This set is pretty neat because there is quite a bit of information included with it.

We played the first round with four players aged 10 to 72, and it was the most fun we've had with such a large age span.
The fact is that random chance doesn't make a very interesting game for adults (unless you're making bets, I suppose), and it doesn't make a very interesting game for children either if they're used to games with more strategy involved.

I had to purchase new elves & reindeer (which is heartbreaking since I couldn't recall the exact date our first elf arrived to us over 4 years ago!)  So the elves brought along the St. Bernard's to help them spread Christmas cheer (the elves wrote a letter to the kids explaining it all).  They didn't realize at first that the boxes with the pups were new items (each year, out elves arrive with the books in the box and have the plastic popped open since they "fly" out of the packaging).  When I came into the room to read the letter, I asked the kids why the box was taped closed and that's when the excitement really began!

9774	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	These eggs are just poor quality. I bought them for my 20-month-old son for Christmas, but I can only get about half of them opened. The colors are not very vibrant, and the plastic container (the reason I chose this version of this product) is just very cheaply made. Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase, but the seller was very gracious to refund my purchase price, no questions asked!
I've not played the 1 campaign or 2 skirmish missions yet, but after reviewing them I think it is safe to say that they seem to be of similar quality to the ones we got in the base set. SMALL SPOILER ALERT:  It is not too surprising that if the rebel figures win this campaign mission they get the Rebel Saboteurs as allies in future games.
In all seriousness, it can be a riotous good time, and rewards strategic thinking.  Just like all good games.

Now, in its defense, the game does pretty well. The bits are very nice, the rules are mostly clear, and the DM-less play works okay. It's not perfect. Occasionally you may run into situations you have to house-rule. I'm okay with that, but YMMV.
Again, I can't recommend this enough to those that have the original board game.
463	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This has been a really fun family game!  We all enjoy word games.

It seems a bit complicated at first, but mainly you have bikers and prospects in your 'clubhouse.'  The dudes(bikers) give you a +10 life advantage, in general they are worth more, and you want to upgrade your prospects to member dudes.  Everyone knows how many you have. Assets are kept hidden, and consist of guns, cash, and contraband.  During rounds, bikers are strategically placed at places of operation.  The board is a series of cards with places of operation that you exploit.  Where it gets interesting is if another gang is on a location that someone else wants to exploit, then you might have to start a fight. The object of the game is to win with the most cash.
6036	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I got this for my friend for Christmas.  It was more of a joke gift but it turned out to actually be a lot of fun.  More often than not, board games that are based off of franchises turn out only sub par, but this one was good!

8558	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Got this based on the reviews and how much we enjoyed Sleeping Queens (for a game the whole family can play).  We didn't enjoy this one nearly as much.  It isn't a bad game, but when placed next to other games in our game closet this one wouldn't get chosen.
It is a much faster paced game, which is great because you don't have to wait for your slow opponents to make a move. You actually are punished if you go too slow, because the goal is to be the quickest.


7874	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	The reason for giving one star is because the manufacture is misleading the customer's with wrong description.

 Yup.  But for comments to the theme itself, I think the original game is pretty strong.  Struggling to eek out routes to complete destinations- trying to get there before someone cuts you off can be very nerve racking, especially when two or more destination cards are riding on making that connection.  Ive got lots of little trains!  Cool little plastic trains!

To begin, the market board is placed in the center of the play area.  Each player will receive 2 player boards and pawn in their chosen color.  They will choose one of the characters to keep and discard the other.  The player board is placed in front of the player with the character side up.  Players will also receive a set of goods markers which are placed on their player board on the 1 crate square to indicate that they have 1 of each good.  The goods markers are also randomly placed on the market card.  The building cards are all shuffled together.  You will then draw a number of cards equal to the number of players and place them face up on the table along with the Lighthouse, Canal Lock and Shipbuilder's Guild cards.  These will be the first building available to purchase.  The remaining cards are placed face down on the table.  Play now begins.
7459	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I would give it less if it was possible. Bought this for my son for Christmas and the "solar power" is a joke! It doesn't work! If you hold it in the window sill tipped to the sun it will work but otherwise it's useless! My son likes the drawer and pretending to be a grocery store so he won't let me return it but I'm really unhappy the adding function doesn't work. Basically it's just a place to put the pretend money. Thank goodness the drawer at least opens and closes or it would be in the trash. VERY DISAPPOINTED.

1) The included 'Office' expansion (12 cards I think?) should not be optional or labeled as an 'expansion'.  It feels like it should be part of the core game and more like a marketing gimmick that the "Office expansion is included".  If they never pointed it out to you, there's no reason to think these cards are in-fact an expansion.  I played with them all right from the beginning.  The inclusion of the 'Office' cards may even have a few people argue it make the game a tad faster and easier (but maybe only for the solo player variant).
935	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Our family loves this game! We try to play board games as a family at least once a week, and this game is often one of our top choices. The objective is to connect as many rails as you can. As the makers recommend, our youngest player is eight, but we began playing it when he was seven. We've also played with adults who enjoy it just as much as younger players. Average game time is around an hour, so it's a great way to unplug from the TV, computer, tablet, etc. and simply spend time together. We look forward to getting some of the other editions!

I'm sure we will have a fun and boisterous "Qwirkle Tournament" involving all ages (4-99)!!!

Like WFRP3, Edge of the Empire uses special custom dice. I love custom dice, so I love this. I just hope Fantasy Flight Games does a better job of keeping the Star Wars dice in print than they did the Warhammer dice (seriously Fantasy Flight, WTH??). They do have dice rolling apps for iOS and Android out for both Warhammer and Star Wars, and I really like them. In fact, as a GM, I'll say that if you're GMing you should only use the dice rolling app. It allows you to put together dice pools for your NPCs, bad guys, and monsters faster, and it instantly gives you the tallies for successes, failures, advantages, setbacks, etc. But as a player I prefer the tactile experience of rolling actual dice, which is very satisfying with these systems -- provided Fantasy Flight makes enough dice and keeps them in stock.

5426	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I'm sure you're familiar with "Scene It?" since there are a dozen variations of the game out, and "Comedy Movies Deluxe" is the latest to join the team. Gameplay for this one isn't that different from other versions of the game, so you can easily step into this one with almost no learning curve if you've played another version before. The thing that sets this one apart is the wonderful collection of movies you're playing with. This game borrows from movies from classics like "Caddyshack" to more modern hits like "The 40 Year Old Virgin", "Bowfinger" and others. The thing that makes this though is that it does carry a "Family" label, meaning though it may touch a few raunchy comedies, the clips you see are nothing you'll have to be embarrassed about. If you want to relive some hilarious moments from movies you might have missed and more you've definitely seen, this is a wonderful way to spend an evening with the family.
However, it is now three months later.  The credit card slot no longer makes the sounds it used to make.  I thought that maybe the button battery was low.  It took me a half hour to change a button battery because the battery holder is so poorly designed.  There is one long screw with a washer holding the battery in, and the battery just barely unscrews.  If you can pry off the battery cover at all (I managed this by pulling on the screw with my finger nails), only one side will come off because there is a tab holding the other side in.  Eventually, with much difficulty, I changed the battery only to find that the keys for the numbers 7, 8, and 9 on the cash register no longer worked when I turned the thing on again.  Some wires may have come dislodged in my struggle to change the battery.

I left the rest of it stock and it works as well as any high end crawlers costing double or more.

The board is based on a number of tiles that resemble drink coasters, randomly drawn and placed to make the board, turned over to make them available locales as the game goes on.  Being the only gang occupying a location means you get the benefits on the card, such as getting money, guns or contraband, or selling guns or contraband. While its possible to stay out of one anothers way, being aggressive is the only way you're going to get ahead in this game. While the throw-downs can be done without guns, having guns definitely skew winning the fight in your favor. It means youll bring down more heat on your gang  possibly even needing one of your members to take the fall and be taken out of play to be sent to prison. Using guns can also send your rivals members to the emergency room and possibly the morgue, diminishing that clubs power. Turns are quick but still demand consideration as timing of the actions your gang undertakes is important.

My children enjoy this game, but they both get bored of it after a while.  With the way the game runs on chance, it's all too easy for the game to take an excessively long number of turns.  It can end up with an incredibly long game that no one really wants to sit around to finish.  It's a good game (obviously because it's become a classic) but it's definitely not my number one choice on children's games.

8058	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	If you notice most 5 star reviews are dated pre 2006. It seems the board has been changed since then. I bought this for my son and was expecting the classic candy land game...I was very surprised to see the changes that have been made. This version is very busy...which causes it to lose a lot of it's charm (and give me a headache). This game is meant for toddlers...the board shouldn't be a chaotic mess.  Not a good update in my opinion.  If something isn't broke, don't try to "fix" it.

2887	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This came today and my son instantly recognized it from the book.  He is two so I'm a bit worried about the little bear attached, as in what if he rips it off in the middle of the night and chokes on it kind of fear.  So for now, we will watch him, but otherwise seems great.
We liked that the gears' teeth are smaller than some of the other play gear sets, giving this one less of a "little kid toy" look. Our toddler, like most, is drawn to things that aren't toys first and foremost. The magnets are strong enough to keep the gears where they need to be, but even a small child can still easily nudge one across the metal surface to mesh the gears.

The Central Officer has another major responsibility in this game- managing an app on a tablet, cell phone, or laptop (which is downloadable for free from FFG).  The game plays out in two phases- a timed phase and a resolution phase.  During the timed phase, the app tells the Central Officer what action can be taken by which player, and gives them a strict time limit to accomplish their task.  The tasks may be: research tech in a specific slot, an alien invades the HQ, interceptors must be deployed, UFOs appear over continents or in orbit, a new mission must selected, and more.  The Central Officer must relay all of this information as quickly as possible to the other players, and make sure they are not taking too long.  During the resolution phase, players then resolve all of the tasks that they set in motion in the timed phase.  Players roll dice in order to get success for tech, knocking down UFOs, killing aliens in the base, and more.  Players roll XCOM D6 dice, which features two success symbols on, as well as a numbered D8, which functions for the alien enemy.  When you fail a dice roll, you can roll again, but it becomes increasingly likely that you will be defeated because with each non-success you move the threat marker up one space (from 1 to 5).  If the D8 is equal to or lower than the threat marker, it is a fail and you lose the scientists, interceptors, soldiers, satellites, etc...  If, at the end of the resolution phase, there are UFOs left over continents, that continent is moved forward on the panic track (if two nations make it to the orange section of the panic track- the players lose the game).  If there are any aliens left over in the base, the base damage marker moves forward (if ever this marker reaches the end- the players lose the game- and there are also other negative consequences for it hitting red points).  Players are working toward being able to complete the "Final Mission" and the app will tell you when you are able to do this (based on completing other missions and other criteria).  Once the Final Mission is completed successfully, the players win the game.

The other cars need to be moved to let the red car out.  My children, ages 9, 12, and 14 love this game.  I even enjoy playing it.  It is challenging and you really have to think to get the red car out.

It is a little costly, but the base stats (3 attack, 3 defense, 2 hull and 3 shields) are pretty good. It can also do four different actions, and take many different kinds of upgrades.

1292	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Don't be deceived by the somewhat disturbing characters that are depicted on the game's box art. This is quite possibly the best board game you will ever play (other than Ticket To Ride Europe, which is even better, having benefited from all the years of playtesting that the original got in the hands of the public). It's quick to learn, fun to play (even with only two players), and has infinite replay value. You can add even more replay value by adding the 1910 expansion, and/or the Alvin and Dexter expansion down the road.
Because there's so much more to playing a game than just winning.... ;)

In addition to the two plastic figures, you get 2 deployment cards; one red that costs 7 points and one gray card that costs 5 points (note that the gray one is the same as the one in the  base game, but the red one is new). You also get 6 command cards and 2 skirmish mission cards for use with the skirmish game (all new), 1 side mission card for the campaign game (also new), and 4 ID tokens and 12 ID stickers in 4 different colors (i.e., #7 in purple, blue, red, black).

The beauty of vanilla Ticket to Ride is its simplicity and accessibility for players of all ages and experience levels. Players can take one of three actions on a turn - take train cards (to build routes in the future), take destination tickets (to acquire new points scoring objectives), or claim routes by using the appropriate set of train cards (to score points and progress against objectives). The winner is the player that accumulates the most points for building routes and linking specific cities from their destination objectives. This simplicity allows the game to move at a very fast clip because players have usually chosen their action by the time their turns come around. However, this simplicity does not obviate the need for strategic play. Players will need to effectively balance long-term and short-term objectives, while keeping an eye on their opponents to stay one step ahead. The best part of Ticket to Ride is that you'll find yourself feeling like a powerful, cunning railroad magnate as you complete routes and destination tickets. In the end, it won't matter whether you win or lose because you'll have had an absolute blast.

The pieces are quite small, so I wouldn't have ordered it for anyone younger than him, but there is no reading required, so with adult supervision, any child can play. This game encourages logical and analytical thinking. With the smallest children, it is a study in recognizing their colors. With older players, you can really challenge each other.

SoA:MoM is not like those games.  It's a modern board game but not too complicated.  You have three resources: money, contraband, guns.  The winner is the player who ends the game with the most money, and all three resources are hidden throughout the game, so you won't know who the winner is until the end.  You have two kinds of meeples: members and prospects.  There are different areas in the game, and each area lets you make certain kinds of trades among all your resources.  If 2+ players are on the same area, no one can use that area's abilities until the other player is "eliminated", either by voluntarily leaving (you can bribe players) or starting a fight.  Every turn you reveal "anarchy cards" which can add temporary new areas or temporary bonuses or restrictions.

This is a good game for family fun or for a party. Good for younger as well as older players.
The game is fairly well-balance. It's not uncommon to start in the number 8 seed and still end the game in 2nd place. The game is designed so that even if you are pretty far behind, it's not difficult to catch up (sometimes at the very end) which makes for a really exciting game. You also get to make a good amount of decisions and develop your own driving style. You can use a very "push-your-luck" driving style, play it safe, or anywhere in between. It's also pretty easy to pick up and play.

It's great to have a game with no dice, not two long, and requires some strategic decisions/choices.  My only issue was with the directions in which it was not initially obvious that you are supposed to discard your cards (into a future recycle stack) once you claim a train route, or maybe I was just having a brain glitch.  Anyway, its a great game and my kids really want to play it again tonight (even though they lost to the friend the first time!)

BUT it makes them happy and they enjoy it, so in a way I like it too (just gotta keep telling myself that.) A sanity saving trick is to put something like a pillow UNDER the drum, so its tucked up inside of it. It muffles the sound and makes it not so migraine inducing.

Had I realized the implications of having a calculator rather than $ notation to a 6 year-old, I would have chosen a different cash register that always displays 2 decimal points (4.50 instead of 4.5) and allows you to make change more easily.

This is the Junior version of Quiddler and it intrigued me, as I was wondering whether my seven year old would be able to play this by herself or not. In playing this, the cards are wonderfully made with great imagery and graphics and many colors that truly drew my youngest daughter in from the beginning. I came to find that she did need some help at first as only being in first grade had some limitations in regards to the breadth of her vocabulary. As we played though she got better and better and after a few rounds she had the hang of it. By the end of the game she was asking to play it again. This game really challenges you to think and be creative with your words as well as encourages your kids to learn more and more words in the end. This is a great game that I would encourage for all families!

However, once you settle in and understand the mechanics, Dungeon Roll proves to be a lot of fun to play. You owe it to yourself to give this one a chance, because while the first impression might be a bit rough, it makes a better lasting one in my experience. The mechanics are simple but effective. One player is the adventurer. This person rolls the seven white dice and this forms their party. The party can be made up of specific classes (masks for thieves, swords for fighters, etc) and scrolls. Then the player to your left is for all intents and purposes your enemy for a time.
Still, Dungeon Roll is fast, well-themed, well made and despite the lack of interaction, it is still fun. For the price, its worth picking up if you play games like Zombie Dice or Cthulhu Dice, or just want a simple filler game with nice components.
Mostly we play with 2 players, and it works well... but you can play with up to 6 players.

The air from the bottom also reduces falling damage to the helicopter.  I do not recommend this helicopter on windy days outside because its very light and will be blown away easily.  I also don't recommend this near animals because they will go crazy.  I suggest this helicopter for people ages 8 and up.  The best part about this is that it will almost never break like all those other air hogs helicopters.  Over all I give this helicopter 5 out of 5.
8739	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I use this to demonstrate breathing with my choir students.

Wish I had had one of these years ago.
While I haven't played it yet--my Friday night gaming group has been on hiatus--I was extremely impressed with it when I unpacked it to prep it for the first game night we're back in session. This is so well put together it's insane. No cheapo materials used here either. The only bummer I'm seeing is that you've got to pay so much for the expansions. My gaming group is a solid 6 but occasionally we get as many as 9 players so the base game is on the small side and yet requires at least 3 to play.

Treasure: When a chest is opened during the Monster Phase, the current player gets to retrieve treasure from the Dungeon.

87	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	My 9 year old got this as a gift and loved the adorable puppies we made together.  I think it might be too difficult for her to do on her own at least at first.  My only complaint is that is didn't include enough yarn or eyes, ears etc. to make each of the 8 or 9 dogs pictured.

We didn't know about the series before that, but my whole family has fallen in love with it even since (even the grandparents!). When we found this plush toy we knew we had to have it. My son sleeps with it every night and always points to it when we start reading him one of the books. I was afraid that the Fuzzy doll llama would get ripped off because it seems to be held on by a thread, but it has held up well and we've had it since January '15.

Boba Fett is an amazing figure with both strong offense and defense. Offensively, he rolls 1 blue + 1 green + 1 yellow dice when attacking.  He can also spend surges to weaken or pierce 1. He can also gain +2 accuracy or spend a surges to gain +2 Damage via his battle discipline special ability. Defensively, he has 12 health, rolls a black dice, but he gets an auto +1 block and a +1 surge evade.  And, another option for his battle discipline special ability is to spend a surge to recover 2 damage. And if all that were not enough, he has both mobile and speed 6, making him the most maneuverable character in the game to date.

I consider myself a pretty serious and dedicated board gamer.  I love all types of games and play them regularly.  But Netrunner takes the cake for me.
Reinforcing this tradition is a coloring book from The Elf on the Shelf's animated special, An Elf's Story. It's filled with fun activities and even some Elf on the Shelf stickers that children will love.

Both expansions provide new Lords, buildings, Intrigue and Quests cards, and additional agent tokens for not just the extra player, but each of the original colored player tokens.  As with the original board game, the molded plastic is designed to hold all of the items in a specific manner for well organized storage.

Undermountain really shines in terms of the many quests that it adds into the mix of things with rather challenging requirements but also significant rewards. The quests include those that require a good number of adventurers but the card can also allow for players to use any types of adventurers to complete the quest. Of course there are additional requirements that trigger depending on the sorts of adventurers you send into the mix. And there are some card and building effects that allow you to seed the board with various rewards like adventurers or money in order to entire players to go to that spot.

4218	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	The premise of Chrononauts and Early American Chrononauts the same, so this will be a dual review. In the game, you are a Time Traveler with a Secret Identity and a Secret Mission.  Your job is to collect priceless artifacts, repair enough paradoxes, or change time enough to arrive back safely at your alternate timeline. For this example, we will be, Betty and our mission will be "The Scientists' Wish List." We can see on our card, that we want the year 1945 to be black and 1968 and 1969 to be red. (We'll get to how to make that happen.) For the artifacts, we need to collect any Live Dinosaur, the Crown of Thorns, and a Cure for Cancer.
Other things, I love about this game are the unique gameplay options you can experience. If you can't find a friend or family member to play with you, there is a solo option. If the regular way of playing isn't challenging anymore, you can combine Chrononauts and Early American Chrononauts to make Uber Chrononauts! There are also very affordable expansions! A lot of games make you buy a whole new game with more cards (or pieces) to get new content, but for a few bucks, you can get 13 new characters with the Lost Identities expansion, and what's neat is they used fan submissions to craft these cards. Crazy Joe is my favorite in this pack, as he wants you to have 13 un-patched Paradoxes on the board. 13 paradoxes normally means everyone loses, but in this case he wins! It's a nice way to add a little chaos among friends. If you don't need more identities, there's also an option called The Gore Years, which expands the timeline from 2000-to 2008 and helps us imagine what could have happened if Gore instead of Bush had become President. I'm personally hoping we get another expansion after the next election called The Trump Years (or something similar to that).

4123	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is the second 'small box' expansion for Eldritch Horror - I would compare this to the 'Forsaken Lore' expansion, which is the first 'small box' expansion.  Strange Remnants adds one new Ancient One along with the supporting card decks.  It also adds more cards to all the location decks, making all of those decks taller and increasing the variety of cards pulled during any given game.  Many would argue that getting 'big box' expansions like 'Mountains of Madness' (which I also own) is a better investment but it depends on your approach.  I do enjoy getting new side boards and so on but I actually prefer beefing up the base game mechanics with new cards to add variety.  For me personally I prefer 'small box' expansions as they add more to the base game without adding any clutter like new side boards.  Also, 'small box' expansions have a lower buy-in cost than 'big box' expansions.  To sum up, if you're an EH fan you probably already have this and if you're on the fence I'd say get it just to beef up the base game card variety.

5879	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Sellswords, from Level 99 Games, is a fun and engaging light card flipping game.  At the beginning of the game twelve cards are dealt out in a pile in the middle of the table.  Back and forth, each player takes one of the cards, which boasts a red side and a blue side, depending on who plays it.  Each card has four attack numbers on its sides, as well as special text that allows for special abilities during the game.  Placing a terrain card in the middle of the table, which may contain special modifiers to the game, players take turns placing their cards next to already placed cards or the terrain.  When a card's attack value on the side that is adjacent to an enemy card is greater than the enemy card's, the active player may flip the enemy card over to his color.  Each card's special abilities, however, can be game changers.  For instance, a card may allow you to attack a card two spaces away instead of just being adjacent.  One card will allow you to successfully any card around it, but then that card itself must be flipped.  Some cards effect scoring.  And there are many, many more.  Once all cards have been placed, scoring takes place by determining the number of your cards in rows and columns.  After two rounds, the player with the most points wins.
6908	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I love the logic of this game and couldn't wait to share it with my husband.

It's a fast-paced game and supremely fun for anyone who likes Scrabble or crosswords.  There is only one Q and a couple of Zs.  We allow proper nouns for those letters in our game---otherwise they end up in words like "qi," a real word allowed by Words with Friends, meaning "energy."  The less players quibble about whether these kind of words are "allowed," the more fun they will have.  There are no points to keep as in Scrabble.  You just try to go as fast as possible to use up all tiles.

The bright side is that bananagrams is also a pretty free form game. It can work with a number of players (even 1), could easily be played in teams, could be played as one giant crossword rather than 1 crossword per player, and with some additional thought, more alternative game types could be created (maybe even something as simple as "nouns only").
It is fun for kiss and parents,  she wakes wanting to find him. It is adorable how excited she gets looking for him. Then when she finds him, she is overjoyed!
Definitely recommend Fluxx to anyone.

Sound simple? It's not! Everyone at the table is trying to do the same thing, and once you successfully get an organization into your 'power structure' it still can be taken away by another player.

After clearing each level, the player is left to decide whether he or she wants to push deeper into the dungeon or to return back to the tavern to lick their wounds and sit safely until the next round. Play then passes to the next players on the left until each person has gone three times. After every participant has played three times, the treasures and experience earned are tallied up and the player with the highest total is the winner.

The game is fun for the adults in the house too.  It reminds me a little of dominos because you have to match future pieces with pieces previously played.  I think it is a little easier to play than dominos because there is a little less strategy involved.  However, it is still a super fun game.

3638	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I just finished playing my first ever game of Adventurers: Pyramid of Horus, with my two six year old twin boys, my nine year old boy, my thirty year old brother and his thirty one year old friend. Why do the ages matter? Because every single one of us had an absolute blast from six years old all the way up to the thirties. When the game first started off it went at a medium pace but as each round came to a close and another block dropped into the pyramid, blocking the path out, things really began to heat up! The frantic balance between going further into the pyramid for one more treasure versus playing it safe and staying close to the exit for small treasure is perfect. My six year old boys understood the rules and with minimal help were able to manage their own turns. I just can't say enough about how fun and exciting this game was. The quality of the board, miniatures, cards and accessories was top notch but I expect nothing less from Fantasy Flight games. By the time the dust settled the entire family had laughed, yelled, jumped out of our seats, shouted with joy and had the greatest fun with a board game we've had in a long time.

Just as fun to play with my 10 year old now as it was with my sister in the 1980's.
In a nutshell, the corporation builds itself up by placing agendas on the field as servers, and guarding the servers with ice (defensive firewalls) until they can score that agenda. Runners build up their power, and make runs (or attack) the corporations servers, trying to steal agendas to score. On the surface it seems like a simple concept, but after playing a few games you realize that there is more strategy involved than you initially expected; I imagine that people who rate this game poorly haven't played enough to realize this, and chalk it up to being a luck based game. While I concede that any card game has a bit of luck involved in what you're dealt, I compare this to something like Magic The Gathering. Ever wonder why it's the same group of people who sit at the finals each year? As with this game, there's a lot of strategy in being able to play the hand you're dealt.
  I would definately recommend this game to anyone even if your child has no interest in ships at all.  I didn't and I still don't but the game is a classic.

D&D 4th Edition: A 64-page manual that is the same flimsy quality as the Player's Guide.  Again, this doesn't really function as a guide book as much as it does an adventure that you're supposed to learn as you play.  However, instead of trying to tell a story or investigate a full dungeon, it is instead just a series of battle encounters, separated in a way that feels devoid of a cohesive experience.  You'll see an example of how all of the player character's and enemies' pawns are laid out on the map, and then a description of how a battle between these two groups are supposed to play out.  You are intended to play through the encounter, and then start over with a different encounter with different enemies, learning a new basic combat maneuver.  While this might be interesting to battle game strategists, there is no "Role Playing" here: no storytelling, no character development, nothing that makes you feel like you're actually part of the adventure aside from fighting enemies.  Plus, this does again not function as a resourceful guidebook, as once you play through it once, you'll never need it again.  There are no tools here for an aspiring dungeon master to craft their own dungeon, stories, NPCs, campaign setting, or any other tool necessary to keep playing after this first adventure.  Your only choice is to play through the same encounters again, or shell out more money for the more advanced products, which will make this box seem redundant.  I would rate this a 3/10.

My son has had this for a couple of years now and it has been a constant source of entertainment.  He pulls it out and it stays out for a week or more before going back on the shelf, and everyone in the family takes a turn at it.  It is a great solitary game, though we have begun to add a timer (a sand filled hour glass works perfectly) just to take it up a notch.
For what it's worth, Candy Land (also by Hasbro) has shrunk to 20"x15", too and now includes smaller gingerbread men playing pieces and color block cards.  I'm not thrilled about that, either, but the new Candy Land is still playable.  Some games can tolerate more shrinkage than others.

It would be best if at least one person had a detailed understanding of the rules, as there are a few things that come up that don't happen often.  It has a unique way of handling turns, which ends up rotating who goes next in a fashion that is unlike most games--it is based off of how many "turns" (or minutes) an individual takes at any given time--the more they take, the longer they wait for their next turn--based off of how many turns other players take as well.

States it is for ages 8 and up.  This is pretty accurate as I think it may be a little difficult for younger kids to have this much strategy.  I don't think there is an age where someone outgrows the game.  Keep in mind, this game has a ton of small pieces that can be lost or put in the mouth.

I highly recommend this game for any number of players. Four players is absolutely the best, but it remains fun even down to one player. In fact, at one player there's no one to blame for bad decision but yourself. Set up and tear down is fairly easy, and other than getting one or two baggies for the cardboard chits, everything else in the box came pre-bagged and separated. Everything feels high quality, which is typical of Fantasy Flight Games.

It provides hours of fun and allows the child to use their own imagination and decorate the journal anyway he/she desires. Highly recommend this product.
The highlight of this game is its asymmetric gameplay.  The two sides have similar objectives which are to score Agendas, but they do so in different ways.  The corporation must advance their Agendas while the Runner tries to steal them.
Had this 1 month now, love how the plastic arms pop off is too much pressure (or stepped on)  and easy to pop back on. Not sure how long they will pop in and stay snug, I am sure if anyone can wear it out it is my boy... but so far so good.
We have come up with a scoring system of sorts just to provide an added twist. If you win, you get ten points per round. If you loose you must subtract 1 point for each letter left in your hand.

By now, I've played almost 10 games or so almost all of them with 5 players. As expected the game feels much more balanced now. A lot more combat. But as one commenter pointed out this game plays best with 6 players. Having 6 players forces combats and that's when things get really interesting.

Each player takes turns moving a character.  The characters are set in plastic holders so the opponent cannot see which they are until they are engaged.  When an opposing player advances into a realm held by the other player's character a battle ensues.  Unless there is an ability resulting in automatic defeat of another or retreat, combat ensues.  Each player chooses an attack card, reveals it at the same time and players modify battle based on the text or the strength number of the revealed card.  The character with the higher strength wins the battle, though there are cards which end in other results such as Noble Sacrifice which the Fellowship can play to end in defeat for both characters.  The cards are discarded after use.  Play continues until a result ends in a win for either side.
The game is played in the rounds or each playing delving into the dungeon three times each. The first player then rolls the 7 white dice to determine their party that may include Champions, Fighters, Wizards, Thieves and Clerics. The person to the Players left is the Dungeon Lord and rolls the Dungeon Dice as well as tracks the current players lever with the Level Die.

The narrator, a well-chosen, grandfatherly type who could very well have been in the original cast (though of course he was not), guides you warmly through the proceedings. The story is that the Misfit Toys have scattered and the players must rescue them before Bumbles the Abominable Snowman captures them.

5376	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game is pretty simple to learn.  The idea is to make 'runs' by matching colors or shapes.  Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series.  My daughters enjoying playing it, especially my 8 year old.  I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games.  This game is a great family game.  Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night.
I haven't come across a soul who didn't like this game, but you may say that my social circles are small.  You are probably right, but I love growing them with games.

1477	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this game for my 7-year-old for his birthday, as we always get him a game for one of his gifts, and he loves trains.  The game, which is for ages 8 and up, took a little bit of explaining, but he now understands it and loves it.  To make the game a bit simpler, we are not using the "ticket" cards for now. This is something we will add once he can read and do math in his head a bit better. I would definitely recommend this game. It's something the whole family can enjoy.

Mechanics-As I mentioned above, this is a deck building game.  I like those games, but this one has the novel twist of letting all players do the same action as the lead player.  Now, if you're lucky/smart, you can take an action each turn instead of just waiting for your turn like in Dominion.  Also, the mechanics are very simple.  Play a card, draw a card and play cards that match symbols for more results, and discard/draw.  Easy as pie!  But, don't let the simplicity of this game make you think that the game doesn't have some depth to it. 5/5

If you love the theme but are on the fence and feel like your falling on the side of going for it?  I'd say jump in and grab it.  I know that this one is pretty pricey, but you do get a ton of gameplay for your money.  My advice, if you have the means, is to grab either City Of The Ancients or Swamps Of Death.  One or the other.  You don't need both to give it a try - each box is a complete game.  Whether or not you wish to expand can be determined later.  If you still don't know?  Then locate a local gamestore with a good reputation of customer service and see if they have live gaming going on - many of them do.  If they are running a game, or if a patron is running a game then drop in to view it in action.

My 10-year-old's occupational therapist introduced us to it as a way to help her learn to overcome frustration and solve puzzles. It has been a wild success. Both of my girls will sit and stare at the pieces and move them around and move them back until they get the solution. Particularly nice in my opinion is that the solutions are on the back of the cards, so if you do get really stumped, you can look at the answer. In our house, if you look at the answer, you have to start over and figure it out on your own after solving with the answer. I've found it helps with memory and perseverance. I highly recommend this game for kids and adults. There are three expansion packs you can also buy and you probably will need them as your kids will breeze through the first forty cards if they're anything like mine.

Replaces the slot usually reserved for the ubiquitous monopoly board with a board game whose competitive gameplay keeps every player involved for the duration of the game.

Gameplay works for 2-5 players but this board shines at 3-5 players (for a great 2-player variant try the Nordic Countries box).
The other think that I like about this is that there is a piece of education in here.  I like to try to find some value in a game other than just pure entertainment.  I think this is good for wee ones as it teaches them math skills such as judging the distance they want to cover and then determine the best gear to be in that will make it most likely for them to end up where they want to be.  So there is some addition, subtraction, and some elements of gauging chance.  Also, it makes them think about path finding and stringing up multiple moves to get through a technical turn.

8950	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought these for my nephew (3 1/2 years) to add to the basic Gears Gears Gears set I bought him last year. My son had these when he was younger and used them for years - they really grew with him and the adults that played with the Gears with my son, and now my nephew, equally enjoyed playing with them. It is a great open-ended toy and they hold up really well. I highly recommend this to everyone - both boys and girls - for play over many years from at least 3 years to 12 years for the motorized kits and such.
A MUCH BETTER and virtually FREE chemical rocket can be found on the Steve Spangler website.  It uses things you have in your house to build the rocket.  The only thing you'll need to buy is a rubber stopper.  Plus, the site actually talks about the reaction that's happening.

I totally recommend this screen.
My biggest disappointment with this game is the plastic they used for the container. Very cheap plastic. It cracked and tore the first 1 or 2 plays. The rest of the game pieces are quality.
You can't win with the various Creepers, but you probably can't win without them, either. The Ungoals throw the game to the forces of evil, and even the regular Goals are delightfully twisted ("The player who has Federal Agents and the Drunk on the table wins"). If you know your Lovecraft, you'll enjoy getting the story references, and if you don't, it doesn't affect the gameplay. As usual with Fluxx, sheer luck determines the winner, but in Fluxx, unlike, say, chess, winning isn't the point. You get to play with madness, and isn't that cool?
Overall, though, this product comes as advertised and is a nice addition to my collection of Scrabble boards.

There's a section on the active wars taking place as we speak in Dresden's world.
This game has great repeatability as well - every question card has 3 questions per side, and the cards are meant to be played once through on the yellow side, then back through on the blue, choosing one question from the card each time.
I even like that the map give a little bit of a geography lesson to us everytime we play.

2254	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	So as everyone else, I want and need traditions for my daughter to grow up with. Since I have begun to see these elves everywhere and by elves I do not mean this product. I see the "elf on the shelf" I didn't run in to Christopher and Christina until I moved to north pole Alaska and the only large elf they had was Christopher and Christina so before making an instant purchase I came home and decided to do some homework. Come to find out Christopher was the original ELF. I will no longer follow the crowd of people supporting the copied elf. It's almost ridiculous how someone's idea can be copied as closely as it has. so my daughter will be receiving Christopher and until she's old enough to appreciate it mom and dad will be enjoying him :) I love the book as well it's simple and has a page in the end to sign it to someone which also makes it a cute keepsake. It is also perfect sized but it was kind of a pain to remove it from the box I mean after you cut the strings you can flip it over so that is fine and the box is perfect for being able to store the elf and book for later. Definitely recommend this product for your family choice especially instead of the elf on the shelf and there is also more than just this one there are additional books and characters.
I never read to her that stupid "book" of course. And the toy elf is still somewhere in her toy chest I think.

2366	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This card driven game has elements of hand management, asynchronous role selection, and deckbuilding on top of a space 4x theme. The 4x is pasted on since you cannot attack each other and each player is building a tableau of cards. The unique follow/dissent mechanism tied to the role selection of other players means you really have to pay attention to other players turns and not tune out until your next turn. Great spin on the typical deckbuilder card game. A good amount of replayability with several paths to victory.
I found the launch instructions lacking in safety warnings.  In five launches we had one kid hit in the face by the rocket almost immediately after setting it on the ground and a second hit with the stopper that shot out prematurely as the rocket was being set on the ground.  Maybe we didn't get the stopper tight enough - who knows?  In hindsight this toy makes a better cork gun than a rocket.

694	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We bought this for our son when he was 5.  The three separate compartments are great, I like that it's made of metal not plastic and I like that it can be rubber-banded together or separated.  It's very sturdy and has survived being dropped and knocked about. He loves portioning out his money into the different areas and seeing how it grows.  We aren't using the little bank book yet, because he still puts money in randomly sometimes, so we'd have to count it constantly.  It will be nice to use in a couple of years though.

2 reference cards.
But once you get over the learning curve this game just keeps giving.  Like I said I only played 1 game with my roommate and I can already tell that I will have to play SEVERAL games with the SAME hero in order to truly understand how to use him perfectly.  Which is surprising considering that each individual hero only comes with their unique ability card (1), finishers (2), Style cards (5), Unique base (1), and tokens if they have any.  For most games you would think you can easily master understanding how to use the character after 1-2 plays.  That's not the case for Devastation, within the 1-2 games you understand the core concept of the character.  But it seems like I will not truly master the character until I have AT LEAST 5 games as them.

Replayability (5 out of 5)
The game includes 36 treasure tokens and 24 experience tokens.  These are your usual card board cut out pieces.  the pieces are good thickness and didn't have too much of a problem punching them all out.  The game also includes a rulebook along with a Book of Heros.  The game play is simple, and the rulebook does well to explain the game and includes some illustrations.  The Book of Heroes is just a book comprised of pages summarizing the different hero cards and providing further clarifying information as necessary.
Now --I love the fact that you are so engrossed in the game and solving the "puzzle" that you have to talk to one another.  You have to focus on each other and no tv, phone, computer, or other distractions.  Just you and your partner.  I love it.

It is a great deal of fun, as each new game requires a different strategy from the last.  The overall strategy tendencies are difficult to master, and after having played this game 50 times or more, I am still trying to decide the best strategic approach.  It is very easy to learn, and after one play through you will never need to look at the rules again.  The game is expertly constructed using materials that will not break or wear at any time in the near future.

The "Pirate Fluxx" deck is a stand-alone game which has the same basic pros and cons, while being marginally more fun than the basic game. It contains a full deck of cards specific to Pirates, and introduces new concepts along with the new theme. A few key cards of note:
1353	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Ticket to Ride is easy to learn, fairly quick to play.  It is a great gateway game from traditional American games into the (to me) more fun world of Euro games.
Let's compare the two in each of the basic categories:
1615	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	1.0	For this much money, I'd expect the legs/arms to be wired.  The arms are sewn together - and the legs are unpositionable.  There's no way you can pose this elf.  He has one position.  That's it.


5. It's not a collectible card game, mostly. One thing that always turned me off from Magic: The Gathering was the fact that the person who spent the most money, or had a lucky pack could easily over-power everyone else. Star Wars: The Card Game has fixed cards in the Core set and in their expansions.

5260	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	Our family with 3 boys (11, 9 ,6) likes this game but the 6 year old usually is done before the game is actually over :)  It can take a while to play.  The scoring is also fairly complex, despite the easy concept.  I still like it and recommend it to families, just be aware of the length.
2771	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Perfect for our son
3490	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This such a good game.  Luckily it did not bought by WOTC.  The screen has all the info you need to run a game without having to turn to the books.
6246	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	This thing is fun.  Slow but fun.  It climbs everywhere, is water proof (or at least resistant) and has a long battery life.
The one problem with the game is the colored tiles.  They are too similar to each other unless you are in bright lights.  Green is about the only color that doesnt look like its neighbors in the rainbow.  Its something to watch out for, although its not bad enough to ruin the game.
820	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Fun game - losts of pieces, some strategy needed to win. Not your average board game - but that is what I like.
This other player sets a ten sided die counter to the number one, representing what level of the dungeon you are on. That player then rolls one black die for each level you are on. Level one? He or she rolls once, but if you are on level five, they roll five. There are some slight variations on this (for example there are only seven enemy dice), but that is the general structure found here. Then the game is all about luck and resource management.
3791	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	While intimidating at first, this is the first LCG that really captures the spirit of star wars.  Iconic characters, locations, missions, and the Force all combine to make an intricate and strategic game with rather basic win conditions.  If you are a star wars fan and enjoy games, this is definitely worth your time.

4015	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	fun game worth a look
It's good for about 3-4 games before you're moving on to other things.
5072	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Family favorite!  Seriously, I love this game. I love the fact that I can beat my husband whenever we play alone! hahahahahahaha!
7882	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	my daughter loves these! they are still a bit big for her, since she's just barely 6 months old, but she enjoys gnawing on them and knocking them down.
====================================================
Again, this game is pretty amazing. There's a decent learning curve but don't get discouraged. After the first game it will all make sense. I can't recommend this game enough.
Not much to say other than wow . <3
9840	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this fun tunnel for play with my three dogs: a lab mix, a boston terrier, and a bluetick coonhound.  Within a few minutes, using treats and applause they were all going through the tunnel enjoying themselves immensely.  They range in age from almost one year to 7 years, and from about 65 pounds to barely 20 pounds.  It's perfect for all of them (although naturally I am not leaving it out all the time or the youngest might chew it to bits.)  You can see them on flickr.
9634	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Best tent ever. We bought this for a cruise and it worked great. It was easy to pack and worked great at the beach. Very inexpensive and kept my baby out of the sun.
7332	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	great
Secondly, the pieces and the cavities that the pieces fit in are the EXACT same size, made of the EXACT same plastic, and is an EXACT duplicate of the game board I owned in the 70's, so stop your GEN Y whining!
More importantly, the monster cards are pretty easy to substitute monsters already owned for as well.  So your using Giants and don't own the official miniatures?  Use the Ettins.  Its close enough and they're the right size and quantity.  No Lava Beatles?  Well you have spiders!  The only downfall for this approach is that certain combinations that should be allowed won't be due to not having enough compoenents of the proper size/quantity.
3186	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I purchased three sets of these bricks for my daughter when she was 2.  She is now 5, and still plays with them.  They are great for fostering imagination.  She likes to lay them out and create the boundaries for a "house" or a "store".  Sometimes, they are the fence around a farm and all her animals go inside.  Sometimes we just stack them as high as we can and have fun knocking them down.
484	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Can't wait to play this!  Brand new.  We played it at a friend's house and stretched our minds and laughed a lot.
9161	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	One of the more interactive toys

2776	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this plush Pete to go with the book, my grandkids love him.

59	Toys_and_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Cute idea, and the basic steps make sense are are easy to follow if a parent works with the kid. I gave a low review because although my child was excited to take part in this, they get bored when you are doing the work ( trust me you will have to, my kid is in first grade) and the glue provided SUCKS. It's basically Elmers glue and it's just not enough to keep everything together. I can't keep the ears or anything to dry and stay on without falling off. I would recommend hot glue.

(3) Torkil Mux, a level 3 unique pilot that costs 19 points whose special ability reads, At the end of the Activation phase, choose 1 enemy ship at Range 12. Until the end of the Combat phase, treat that ships pilot skill value as 0.
2100	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	What a great idea this is to keep little kids behaving before Santa arrives,  it works for my two grandkids who know that the elf reports back to santa if they are bad.  They make it a game to find him in the morning in his new spot.  This is an excellent purchase and am so happy with it.
2628	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	We have a daughter who loves to draw, write letters, and just be creative!  We got this for her birthday and at first she seemed hesitant to try it out since she was excited about some of her other gifts, but one day she sat down to give it a go and she kept commenting, "This is so much fun!".  She got more and more excited each time she turned the page and saw more ideas to try :)  It was a total hit!
2247	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Christopher Pop-In-Kins is the elf to get! He is cute and not creepy like the other elves. The wires in his arms and legs make it easy for him to hang on to that shelf or light fixture. We didn't follow the story, kept it more like the creepy elf story. I wish there were clothes like the creepy elf has. I have made a little outfit for him much to my daughter's delight. Even found a knitted winter hat that will fit over that giant stocking.
1174	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	Very fun and challenging game! I really like that you can only do one action per turn and it speeds up the game.  Games really only do last 30-45 minutes once you understand the rules.
This game has a small learning curve, but once you play through an entire game, most of the mechanics will be easily remembered for future play. The game map is quite large - made up of two separate fold-out cardboard sheets that are laid out side-by-side. As such, you will need a decently-sized gaming surface to play the game on. A small cardboard table isn't going to cut it!
7043	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	4 year old Nephew loves this!  success

This is a fun game that fans of racing will especially enjoy! Highly recommended! I will add more comments to my review after I have had the opportunity to try out the street racing portion of the game.
6058	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	4.0	I wish I had more gamer friends to play this more.  This appears to be a simple roll the dice and move your mice board game, but there's a bit more to it than that. Don't get me wrong -- it certainly isn't a deep or heavy board game as far as strategy goes. You do have to use your special moves, brakes, and other various moves that may cause some damage to your car in order to move ahead just at the right time.
In this game you take on the persona of one of the characters provided and attempt to rise in power until you obtain the Crown of Command and rule the land. In between there are battles with monsters and freak incidents that can change the way the game plays out. You never know how you or the game will be affected when you pick a card.
8592	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	My five year old son has recently gotten in to games.  His father and I are both big on table top games and he inherited it.  He's great at games like chess, Forbidden Island, mancala and even DnD.  This isn't his most challenging game, but it's fast-paced, energetic and supports good math skills. Recommended for EVERY family.
The game features an innovative time-line movement scheme in which everything a player does costs time, the player can decide how much in most cases, and after the player has fixed the engines or put out a fire or pumped a flooded room out (etc) the time is accounted for and Bad Stuff happens - like more fires breaking out, rooms flooding, hatches jamming, engines quitting, reactors overheating or missiles announcing their intention to launch in ten minutes unless someone does something about it. This means that players precipitate trouble for everyone but mostly whoever comes after them in the move scheme (though in my first game someone managed to re-flood a room they'd just pumped out and drowned as a result). The last person on the timeline is always the first to move, so everyone sort of keeps up with each other on the clock as it were. It looks strange but works well and there's a tactical element to using one's move intelligently.
If the words are acceptable, than that player is the WINNER.
5720	Toys_and_Games_5	POS	5.0	I am actually using this game in my counseling group with younger students to help them with their rigidness and dealing with the unexpected. The students love it and it has been great in getting them to be more flexible with their thinking. We play it with teams which makes it a little bit easier for them to understand and speeds up playing time. I play as my own team so I am able to have a little bit of control in changing things up. With your immature students expect them to point out that FLUXX sounds an awful like a certain four letter word they can't say. Actually, I thought the same thing when I first came across the game. The students love the pirate theme idea. We use a toy parrot to set in front of them if they get the captain card because, then we don't have to worry about head lice with a hat. The students really get a kick out of having me call them the captain. Their favorite card is the talk like a pirate card, because I have the worst pirate accent.
The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting.
