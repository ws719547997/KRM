As with most if not all entries in the "Essential" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that "Thriller" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as "I'll Be There", "I Wanna Be Where You Are", "Dancing Machine", "Ease On Down The Road", the Paul McCartney "Say, Say, Say" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), "State Of Shock" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.

The original Wailers were such an influential band and one of the precious few who while changing the music scene also managed to change culture as a whole.  I've always thought Mr. Marley was the truest poet in music due to the fact that he lived every song he ever wrote as did his primary co-songwriters, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Their music and lyrical content stired up revolution both in their country, in music and in the hearts and minds of people around the globe.  This is one band that still generates a tremendous buzz today years after the release of this fantastic album.

It's always better to actually watch a comic because then you can see the expressions on their faces, and that actually adds to joke just enough to make it funnier.  My favorite part has to be where he rants on about Enron where he comes up with a law should exist.  "If you have a company, and it can't explain in one sentence what it does, it's illegal."  There are a few parts not found on the DVD, but overall you are better just sticking with the DVD.  Pick this up if you are really big Lewis Black fan, otherwise just get the DVD.

The album opens with two songs specially recorded for the album, the first (The best day) being an excellent ballad. The second song (Murder on music row) was first written and recorded by Larry Cordle, a bluegrass performer. Here, George sings it as a duet with Alan Jackson. George rarely sings duets but although there is no obvious reason for this particular song to be a duet, George and Alan clearly enjoyed recording this song. While both George and Alan have made some concessions to the requirements of the contemporary market place, they have both managed to be hugely successful with music that is much closer to traditional country music than most of the music recorded in Nashville these days.

Something else that makes this album different to other ones is that this whole tour, AC/DC tuned the guitars downwards a step, giving the songs a new spark of life in a same old song, but with a slightly different sound to what you have always heard. It also seems like Brian Johnson speaks his words more clearly, not sure what, maybe he was schooled on it or the effect of living in American now has rubbed off, but you can clearly understand every word he says and is singing, and there is no question by anyone like "WTF is he saying?" not that I ever had trouble understanding him. A few songs spark a little new life to by the way Johnsons sings them, it seems he speaks the words clear and propperlly, and doesn't sing them in a slang term cutting off the g from 'ing' words etc.. I dunno if you care about this or not, but I found it pretty interesting to compare what Brian is doing with the songs now compared to 20-30 years ago. Never diss the man, he is the silent rock n roll god at the top that some people slam as not being Bon Scott, but get over it guys, Bon is gone, and Brian has done a great job keeping AC/DC at #1 for all these years... compare him to Bon if you want, but Brian had been in the band longer, has not disgraced himself, kept Bons memory alive, and despite what you say, he's a rock n roll god who even on those so called "bad ac/dc albums" (not that I think they're bad at all) those songs are still better than most other groups greatest hits, so lay off Brian, understand he is the singer now, and STOP comparing him to Bon Scott. Bon was great, sure, Brian is different, but he is too great in other ways and deserves more respect then people always showing up on AC/DC's latest releases and saying "Bon this, Bon that, Bon would've"... don't you think Bon is looking down on Brian and smiling at what a fantastic job Brian has done since Bon passed away? If there is an afterlife, both Bon and Brian will remain with the band, because I am convinced Bon would not say "thanks for takin over, but i'll take it from here" no, you would have two legends in the drivers seats!

As a child born exactly one year, one month, one day, and one hour (December 23, 1964) after JFK's murder, my father would occasionally play this on the stereo at home and this turned me on to JFK. Even at that age, I somehow understood the challenge of his inauguration, the call to put men on the moon, the urging for peace in 63, and the Civil Rights speech in particular spoke to me then and sends chills up my spine today.

There are way too many personal favorites like: Sweet Dreams, I Fall to Pieces, Back In Baby's Arms, She's Got You, Crazy and well really she could make any song come alive with emotion. The sound is superb. My only beef is that I purchased this for only 8.95 at Wal-Mart in the cardboard box and it does not feature a booklet with dates, personnel. Well, I'm an old record nerd, but for most people that may not matter. (All these songs were recorded between 1957 and 1963, the year of her tragic plane crash). If all you want is the music, this is one everyone should have in their home. Patsy Cline was in the forefront of lady country singers and the "Countrypolitan" sound of country music which brought country music from the sticks to the city. She was a once in a lifetime singer!

"Return to Paradise" might just be; what with those beautiful falsetto vocals, "Georgia" might  be an under-rated one of those Southern Anthems that filled up "Tumbleweed Connection". But, for me, the real nuggets are the final three songs "Madness", "Reverie" and "Song for Guy", which all sit well together, kind of a trio of darkness, really; "Madness" is a spine chilling disco-prog-rocker with lots of haunting piano chords; "Reverie" is brief but effective, and "Song for Guy" is suitably melancholy and ethereal, given it's essentially a requiem. The vocal part is particularly evocative.

The video inspired me to purchase this song, and, although my mood is not always angry, spiteful, or vengeful - I am usually able, upon 'demand,' to 'conjure up' the proper memories and female related pain and torment to completely, and thoroughly, enjoy this classic British rock song from the late 1970's!
And there you have it -- 32 minutes of great music, with absolutely no boring spots anywhere to be found, that will surely have you putting "All Killer, No Filler" on repeat.  I know there was a time in the mid-2000s that I used to air this album in its entirety daily, and almost exactly 15 years on from its release, it hasn't dated one bit or lost its power to enthrall you.  I want to add that I'm 41 (incidentally) and have been listening to underground punk rock (Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, the F.U.'s, et al) for decades, and I still think that "All Killer, No Filler" is among the best-crafted punk LPs in my collection, with perhaps the highest replay value of them all.  A masterpiece that started a wave of imitators...  If you don't already own this one, well, what are you waiting for?!

338	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is my favorite song from Rare Earth. In my view it captures the best in Rare Earth's unique sound and energy.
The first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this "essential" collection. Besides the "Ultimate Collection" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.

After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette.

Specifically, it picks up where the multi-disc retrospective Strait Out Of  The Box leaves off, with the old hits culled from Strait's 1994 through  1998 albums.

For this reason and this reason alone you should have this song amongst your bangin' tunes.
6063	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity. Like a soothing wind - Le mesure de l'amour - her voice captures us anew each time we listen to it. Superior backup vocals and orchestration elevate it to its rightful status as a classic. Whether we are asleep with this beautiful song 'secreting' itself into our memory or 'relaxing' in our romantic, nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning, enrichment, and themes so present in this joyous, uplifting recording. "Just send for me, oh baby."

Overall, a pleasurable experience that really brings back the true dance movement. Not those thumping, trance remixes they put out today, but the quality stuff.

Different melodic tones and rhythmic patterns break up what would otherwise be a slightly monotonous album. "Wrap My Head Around That" has funky, organic grooves with clean-cut lyrics that don't mess around with pretense or metaphors, and the surprisingly upbeat "Come On" rides along an impressive electric guitar solo as Williams dismisses a deserving former flame.

Yes, I understand that the singer is actually singing about his love interest who turns many heads at the party they attend.

4832	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Released when she was just 16, this is the underrated debut album from the now-legendary Janet Jackson, and while it doesn't bear the signature Jam & Lewis sound that would make undeniable classics out of her Control and Rhythm Nation albums, it's a great album if you like perky, innocent (and somewhat disco-ish) dance pop, and the producers on hand, including Rene Moore and Angela Winbush (aka the soul duo Rene & Angela), give Janet some bouncy, vigorous landscapes to work with, and they seem to be a good match here, especially on "You'll Never Find (A Love Like Mine)." Foster Sylvers also serves her well with the infectious grooves of "Don't Mess Up This Good Thing" and "Come Give Your Love To Me." Jerry Weaver also works a little magic on the outstanding "The Magic Is Working," and check out "Love And My Best Friend," a tender, impassioned ballad that may be Janet's best sheer vocal performance.

I think you should down load this, even if you don't like Marilyn M. It's just so full of Marilyn creep factor goodness. The vid is funny, frat boy Marilyn, struts amongst the norms, infiltrating, playing with some pretty bunny heads, druggy haze, but the song revs slow & a durge occurrs. Tainted is your drink, your dignity, & your pride is at the bottom of a kiddy pool...
Although certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse.

Despite what you'll hear from these retards below me, TSL's "say it like you mean it" is legendary, marking one of the last good DTR releases, before they went downhill. Each one of the record's 13 songs are amazing, and no two sound similar in the least. High production value and good mixing only add to this records greatness, and you'll probably have it in your cd for more than a couple weeks before moving on to something else.

With ten tracks at around 47 minutes, it's clear that Kem isn't a debut artist who's trying to overprove himself. And he doesn't need to, because every song on this album is great. So why isn't he getting the recognition he deserves? Probably because he's on Motown, the label that seems to only promote artists when they feel like it (see also Remy Shand). But hopefully Kem will soon sell several copies of this great release.
Regardless of which way you view the change in direction, there are some very great songs on this album, including the (almost) title track `Monolithic' as well as the strong opener `Slut Machine' and the famous and very catchy `Radiation Day.'

1269	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since "Hypocrisy". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own "Bells and Whistles" to stand out from the rest. So on to "Stabbing the Drama" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of "Stabbing the Drama" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.

5719	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	It was in 2001, when the punk group Sum-41 finally hit it big with the release of their breakthrough album: ALL KILLER NO FILLER. The band received radio and televised airplay like crazy. Sum-41 also landed soundtrack spots for copilation CD's, the film Spider-man, and the television show Malcom In The Middle. It was clear that the public had finally come around to listening to the punk group's music. The public had good reason. Sum-41 has a great sense of when and how much distortion to use in their very interesting and fast paced rhythm changes. The guitars have a great taste in creating simple but very unique melodies. The bass gives the extra fill in creating the band's harmonies, and the drums keep everything together. The lyrics to ALL KILLER NO FILLER are amusing and can even be considered to be slightly contraversial for the track "Fat Lip". The lyricist makes honest and "in your ears" remarks about society and its expectations of its citizens. ALL KILLER NO FILLER is a fun piece of work, and one I highly recomend hearing in its entirity.

6915	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	I bought this tune just as a trip down memory lane and it did send me back to the 70s. It is a somewhat cheesy tune with vocal with lots of affectation which has some comic value. The recording doesn't really hold up and needs to be remastered. But if like me you need a brief escape to the70s this might do the trick.
"Escape" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song.

79	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the "Off The Wall" & "Thriller" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the "Bad" singles..the only one that was missing is "Liberian Girl" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from "Dangerous" are here besides "Jam". I am not sure why the title cut "Dangerous" included. That should of been where "Jam" should of been. Also the final single from the "Dangerous" album is not included "Gone Too Soon". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song "History" & One song from "Invincible"? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single "One More Chance"? All of these titles are missing. Hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore greatest hits album.

The lineup at this point included Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano, acoustic piano, clavinet, Yamaha organ, ARP Odyssey synthesizer, and percussion); bassist extraordinaire Stanley Clarke (Alembic electric bass guitar, Yamaha organ, bell tree, chimes; excellent drummer Lenny White (drums, percussion); and newcomer Al Di Meola (electric and acoustic guitars; acoustic 12 string guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this is a musician's band.  These guys are all unbelievably talented, with Stanley Clarke setting new standards for performance on the bass that would be equaled by few - this guy is mind-blowingly fast.  For his first time playing with RTF (Al was 19 at the time), Al does an incredible job, although his playing is not as dominant in the mix as it would become on later albums.  With this album, Chick had started weaving synthesizers into the RTF sound and he gets some great tone colors out of the ARP Odyssey on this album, which is plastered everywhere.  As a huge fan of progressive rock and electronica, I do not mind the analog synthesizer use at all, although some jazz fans might be turned off.
7542	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I really enjoy this song and find it so much fun to listen to. I recently added it to my running play list and loved it when it popped up during my last race.

I've always thoughts this song was fun, I'm glad I found and added it to my collection.
2473	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	The last 1:20 of the song is cut off. This is one of my favorite songs from 2001 and I cannot get a clean copy of it from my favorite resource. This is terrible shame, I should have known something was wrong when I couldn't find the Duets soundtrack.
7538	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is a hot cd from start to the end. Foxy has come with the rawness. This is a breath of fresh air to rap especially with weak female albums; Lil KIm's "Notorius Kim", Da Brat's "Unrestricted", Trina's "The Baddest", Angie Martinez's album and especially Amil's and Queen Pen's garbage albums.  This album establishes the fact that the more a REAL MCee raps, the better the lyric becomes and when you add emotion and confidence you will become unstoppable. This is the best Cd that has ever come from her. The first single "Bk Anthem" jumped it off but in actuality it jumped off with that "Bang, Bang" flow. In which Lil kim was put in her place. Then she drops "Oh Yeah" with Spragga Benz which is a hype track. It just keeps flowing on and on with this album from "730" to "Hood Scriptures" (which has the most creative sound I have heard in a while) to Table will turn and so on. So all you [...] Lil kim fans you heard the answers to kim's weak flow on  notorious kim. Now realize this cd is so close to a classic that it is sick. This is one of the best of the year so far. Much success to Foxy and def Jam. She joins the list with Remi,Rah and Eve as being the best female Mcees out now, with much respect to Jean Grey and Apani B. This Cd is tight. One.

"Ride the Lightning" was Metallica's sophomore album, and it represents a quantum leap forward over "Kill 'Em All," setting the sound that has come to be known as "Metallica" to us. The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into "Master of Puppets," arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing "Fade to Black" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track "The Call of Ktulu."

What has always set this recording apart from many of its peers was the textured layer of background vocals, overdubbed repeatedly, to create a doo-wop four-part harmony that would have made even the Beatles jealous.

5211	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	The late Amy Winehouse made such an important contribution to pop and rock musically internationally. Her influence will never diminish or be forgotten. Ronnie Spector's cover of her song "Back to Black" is a fitting tribute from one great legendary lady to another. The CD represents some of Amy's best moments in the studio and will always remain a much sought after classic!!! Amy Winehouse will always be sorely missed by all who knew and loved her and those who enjoyed and listened to her music. Amy was the best and so ahead of her time!!!

Midnight Rider - Gregg Allman
6277	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I definitely agree as well that this song is an instant classic. This song is basically about someone wanting to have sex with you in a very passionate and aggressive way. Like many others, I remember seeing the music video to this song when I was a teenager. I honestly found the music video very eccentric (in a positive way), but creative at the same time, and hearing the song got me interested in hearing it more.  I admit that this review is also influenced by the fact that I think that he is very hot in the video. The song contains many good industrial rock notes in it, and I like the words to the chorus when he nearly seductively whispers towards the middle of the song (there is a cool chorus part where he says the following lyrics that I find very sexy and creative:( Through every forest, above the trees Within my stomach, scraped off my knees I drink the honey inside your hive You are the reason I stay alive). Obviously, many who read this review already know exactly what that part of the chorus means. I was only listing one part of the various great parts of the song that I found very exciting. Obviously, this is also a good song to add to a collection of makeout session/you know what session songs.
1379	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I have very much enjoyed this song, since it was released and still enjoy it to this day. It describes me more today then it did the first time I heard it...I certainly appreciate this song more as an adult.
2222	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I remember when Gangsta Rap came out. I am not really a fan of it, most I can't stand; but this song is so cool.

A song that talks about the tough side of life, if you want to heard the Mp3 sample you will not be disappointed.

3316	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Pleasant song. It's about this preteen who takes his girlfriend to the carnival and hopes to defile her when she's 16 but he gets sent to military school when he's 15. Graduates and comes calling but she got a new man and she wants her life not to change and she ends up a battered women and the guy who went away, he hit the bottle was in and out of jail and now is an elected official.
In my opinion, this is one of 2003s very best releases from a confident new talent who is following his muse and not jumping on the much too crowded neo-soul bandwagon or relying on hip-hop and collaborations with rappers to sell CDs. Keep in mind that I have no issue with any of the aforementioned genres, but cant a young black man be allowed (and even commended) for sticking to his guns as he is the real thing not the creation of some producer. Some critics may not know that Javier not only did his time in a jam R & B band, is also a multi-instrument virtuoso, and served as co-writer on all the songs on his album, a rarity in the world of contemporary R&B.

It has a catchy beat with good lyrics that convey a message you can relate to and doesn't have to stoop to vulgarity like so much of today's pop music.

I was in born in 1982, I remember hearing him on the radio and thought wow what a voice! The song was Dirty Diana from his Bad album. It wasn't until 1991 when his Dangerous album was released that I became a fan of Jackson, Black or White was a stellar video and the cd was just pure pop candy, I ate it up! After the scandal broke in 1993, I lost interest in Jackson but now that he is no longer with us - I hope will be remembered for his music and dancing ability - he was one-of-a-kind. This collection of greatest hits is spectacular! There are couple of Jackson 5 classics and of course the best tracks of his career like Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, The Man in the Mirror, In the Closet, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), She's Out of My Life, Will You Be There?, and Don't Stop Til You Get Enough. He changed the sound and look of pop music forever, RIP Michael!

It's sad that with an independence like this, the freedom that an artist has is lost when dealing with the majors. As Ms Ledisi owns the master for this I do hope it sees a re-lease on her new label, because the masses need to hear this.
I hadn't heard of Enrique Iglesias until he showed up on my Pandora radio play list, but this song is a truly lovely dance song. The instrumentals are stunning, and Iglesias' smooth and deep strains complement the style perfectly. There's nothing terribly *new* in this song - it's a very standard dance-and-romance song - but a song doesn't need to be innovative to be beautiful, raw, and real. Listen to the sample and you may love it.
If you are a Stevie Wonder fan, this is one of his best songs and I highly recommend it. For me, when I play this peppy and happy song, I feel great and very grateful for my many blessings! What an uplifting song!

That isn't to say that she has a great voice, or even a good voice, for that matter. What she has is an amazing penchant for an off-key vibrato intensive warbling that makes her second only to Florence Foster Jenkins for most hilarious soprano of the last century. Miller was a fixture in local community theater and amateur productions, and at one point even took her talent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. I am sure they were very entertained. Truly this woman had a heart of gold, even if she had a tongue of lead.

180	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  "Angel," "Risingson," "Teardrop," and "Inertia Creeps". "Angel" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. "Risingson" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. "Teardrop" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. "Inertia Creeps" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection.

Anvil is a quirky and underrated band and they are a classic band as well.

#7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my "anthem". I admire Mark's clever word play- "Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is..." What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.

Regardless of whether or not "Ride The Lightning" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think "The Four Horsemen" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of "Ride The Lightning", simply read on.
10. Time, time, time- 4/5 Pretty good, its also very true.
One caveat: the audio on this most recent edition is a disappointment.  Apparently Verve was enamored of the novelty of "stereophonic sound" at the time of recording because the separation is so extreme the principals could be playing in separate rooms.  Oscar's piano sound is squeezed and even slightly distorted; Ed Thigpen's drums lack dispersion and upper-register presence. In fact, there's a slightly "canned" quality to the overall sound, making you want to take the lid off.  I have a hunch that if Verve sensed a sufficient market for this recording, they could do wonders by it in terms of refreshing the sound.  (Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for a Japanese or Spanish import.  Other countries are more likely to view the project of restoration as worth the time and money.)

On this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication,  Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting  Irving Berlin classic, "Blue Skies," which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan, whenever he was "sad, when he took a fall and was crying, or anytime he needed his spirits lifted." It's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney's A Capella version. Ms. Boone stated that, like her son Jordan, she would always find comfort in this beautiful song, which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo.

164	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Right up until last year, I was never really much of a Metallica fan.  Then for some reason, I decided to get Garage Inc..  That in turn was followed by Justice, Black, Load, Reload, S&M, Puppets, and now, Ride.  Before buying S&M, I deciding to get the Cunning Stunts DVD.  And  believe me, I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed,  particularly, "Creeping Death" (probably the best song on the  DVD), "For Whom The Bell Tolls", and especially "Kill/Ride  Medley".  Those performances (along with the tracks on S&M) were  what prompted me to buy this CD. I was especially interested in hearing the  original versions of "Fight Fire With Fire" and "Ride The  Lightning" from the Medley.  And let me tell you, they are definitely  killer!  The machine-gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this  CD popular in the first place.  IMHO, Metallica help create speed/thrash  metal in the early/mid-80's.  Not only do you get the killer riffs, but you  also get the popular "Fade To Black" which is similar to  "One" in that it starts out really slow, then gradually picks up  speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo.  And then you have "The  Call Of Ktulu" which is an excellent instrumental by itself (however,  I prefer the S&M version; it sounds SO much better with the  orchestra!).

7653	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	By far the most vocally gifted (if, unfortunately, not most successful) member of New Edition, Johnny Gill, whose voice can either be buttery smooth or deep and growly, keeps his new jack swing to a minimum here and opts for more of a red-hot loverman persona, and it really gives him the best chance he's ever had to make the most of his voice. He really gets sensual here with the beautiful ballads "Maybe," "Take Me (I'm Yours)," and "4 U Alone," though every song is a high quality, well-written and produced piece of work.
If you thought CD's sound harsh, or bass-thin, not like a concert, well, you were right!

That is something today's divas have taken for granted in song. But there are some that haven't been given that credit, past being labeled as a one-hit wonder. Oleta Adams is one of those singers that had made that mark beautifully with one glimmer on the charts with her rendition of the Piano In The Dark Singer, Brenda Russell's song Get Here. The song is definitely one of those that shows strength and beauty with age like a fine wine after years of heart. I still love listening to this song each and every time this comes into heart. If you have never even heard a Oleta Adams song before, this is absolutely the one song to go to. So say you're going to get there to this beauty.
Its so overplayed & way overrated.

hiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner.

It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering "Kill 'Em All" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, "Master of Puppets" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and "...And Justice For All" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for "One".

12. Doris Day - Secret Love (3:44)
I really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.
#4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )

I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.

8016	Digital_Music_5	POS	4.0	Hearing the four man crew from Queensbridge, The Lost Boyz, once again brings back nostalgic memories of the golden age of hip hop music. Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah (R.I.P.), Spigg Nice, and Pretty Lou knew the formula to making good music, with most concepts working. With many dope recognizable singles such as "Music Makes Me High", "Renee", and "Lex, Coups..." (there is a remix floating out there I strongly recommend you hear). But what separates this crew from other groups is personalty. Mr. Cheeks is very charismatic on the microphone, and Freaky Tah plays the background vocals (those unfamiliar, think of him being what Flava Flav is to Chuck D in Public Enemy, only more serious).

"Creeping Death" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear.

The first two songs are clearly the cream of this crop.  I will even say that While You See A Chance is one of Steve Windwood's best songs of all time.  The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.

8607	Digital_Music_5	NEG	2.0	Ever wonder what Sting is singing about at the end of the song? ("Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo, Pi-ojo") The spanish translation of the word "Piojo" is  " flea" or may refer to  a pain, a bothersome person. So, every little thing she did may have been magic but A. Either this chick had fleas in her hair or B: she may have been considered a bothersome person...or C: Maybe this wasn't about a girl at all and Sting wrote it for his Cocker Spaniel. So the story behind the song is even more intruiging than the song itself, no thanks to the stereotypical FM playlists put together by the unimaginitive program directors at the 'so-called' classic rock stations.

8084	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Beautiful song.
Clearly under the influence of later Dylan (perhaps "Time Out of Mind"), the album features a nice mixture of midtempo numbers and killer ballads. Williams' voice which aches with longing and bitterness in many of these songs continues to be one of her strengths in addition to her top notch songwriting. She strikes reminds me somewhat of John Hiatt. "Words" has one of the sweetest melodies Williams has come up with the opening line sums up much of this album--"I would rather suffer in sweet silent solitude". She may feel like she's in solitude but these moving, observant songs open up a world to music fans everywhere.
Sometimes, I'll be driving and I'll pull up to some ying-yang playing hip hop way too loud out of their Ford Focus and then I flip the switch on my stereo to "Ride the Lightning" and it blows their high school BS off the road!

7624	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Great track loved the song, an excellent smooth jazz selection!!
The sound quality was very good but not quite perfect. There is a slight hissing in the background especially when I hear the saxophone being played solo by Getz. I looked in the liner notes and they do mention that there was some "tape delamination" on track five ("Corcovado") and that "some of the master takes have been faded longer or later than they were on the original LP issue." I wonder if this had anything to do with what I heard. In addition, the liner notes also offer a great essay by Doug Ramsey as well as the original liner notes for the LP. There are beautiful photos of Getz, Gilberto and Astrud.
5364	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Stevie Wonder ... this song was great the first time around, great the second time when George Michael and Mary J recorded it, and great now that I have revisited the original Stevie again.  Also, whenever I hear Stevie I think of my girlfriend Mary, who passed away in March 2015.

5727	Digital_Music_5	NEG	1.0	If you have had enough of corporate punk acts like Green Day and Blink 182, then Sum 41 is sure to tick you off even more.  If all the nu-metal garbage around now wasn't making me mad allready, this new corporate punk is ticking me off even more.  The same old three cord progression on every song, stupid uninspired lyrics, and packaged for MTV wanna be rebellion is what makes up this drink coaster in the making a complete package.  And what makes me laugh even more is how kids think that Sum 41, Blink 182, and Green Day are supposed punk bands because they're on MTV, well kids, this ain't real punk.  Real punk is Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Black Flag, and dare I say it, even NoFX.  Then again, there are kids scratching their heads wondering "who are they, they're not on MTV, they're no good".  But what do I know?, I'm just some guy who listens to the above bands and other stuff outside the mainstream, so my opinion doesn't matter at all.  Now go listen to your Linkin Park CD.

144	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	Metallica's second album, 1984's "Ride the Lightning," was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.

114	Digital_Music_5	POS	5.0	I recently got into Metallica, and so I'm obsessed with finding everything they have done. This is an older album, but it's amazing. I watched some documentaries about them and had no idea that they were an underground band which makes their success even cooler. Every song is great. The Call of Ktulu is insane. They are all extremely talented and this shows why people like their music so much.

Finally, we have "PaperFace". I have no idea what that means, but the actual song was just annoying. Rivers starts off singing quietly, until the tension in his voice builds up and enters the chorus. The chorus really annoyed me because Rivers is screaming his lungs out while the rest of the band is banging as hard as they can on their instruments. Once AGAIN, there's another middle section. Just don't really like it.
