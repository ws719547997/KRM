Based on previous reviews, I opted to try this unit.
AND it was less expensive through Amazon than one not nearly so nice at a local box store.


7832	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works well, was the right price, perfect for a dehumidifier hose that you can route out of the vicinity. Was kind of a pain to thread on the dehumidifier at first, but went on after a few tries (I've bought PLENTY of hoses and have issues with all of them so I think this issue is user error). Not much else to say.

~The Rebecca Review
I've never seen this type before, it has clever spring loaded rods that trip and are very sensitive and easy to set.  Setting it the first time took me 2 minutes to figure the thing out ... What the ?? And then it was fine.  It's a live trap but is so sensitive and fast that it never missed a mouse.
Nelson is very unhelpful in fixing it or telling you how to, and they obviously make a lot of of after sales money selling very expensive motor/gears kits to people who are dumb enough to invest more money into this cheaply made sprinkler
2542	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I like the tool it sure beats the hell out of the  scissor action style, that will work u to death!! I used mine to try to dig a shallow water well. Hahaha.. Yea!!! What a waist of my time I dug 30!!!!! Feet!!! Yea! I dug 30ft didn't hit s***! Other then sand and clay. At 30ft or even 25ft it feels like your pulling a person up out of the hole. I didn't disconnect my pipe while coming out of the hole and with that much length and weight the pipe just snapped off in the air haha it broke at the threads so I could just go and have the pipe threaded again but if I had to guess the water is prob 50-160ft deep. Needless to say I'm done! And I do not  recommend !!! Anyone try this! Your just pissing in the wind. And for 4-5k to pay someone to drill it?? Just go buy a 4wheeler and a tank on a small trailer and drive to the creek and load up lol. Or get a rain barrel pipe your gutters into it. Way way cheaper. Then 100Plus dollars for 30ft of 3/4 metal pipe. And not hit s***.
191	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Some assembly required but boy does this make fertilizer application easy. I used to have a drop spreader and endured using it until we bought more property. This thing lays down some fertilizer. Takes longer to clean it than do my acre. I don't see why it won't last a lifetime. I you are up against edges all of the time you might want to get the directional plates offered. Oh yea, I just double checked, made in USA. Finally something that has some quality left in it.

9346	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This zapper is the most low maintenance zapper out there at a great price.  I have it on a timer that turns it on at dusk and off after dawn.  It has even helped with the garden by killing the buggies that would otherwise snack on my fruits/veggies.  I don't even use the chemical for it and I've noticed a HUGE reduction in the mosquito population (not to mention free protein for the chickens!) I've used it the last half of the past summer and didn't have to clean it out at all as all the bugs fall right through the trap.  Yay!  Like others have said, keep it away from hang out areas as it does ATTRACT before it can kill.
8958	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Not too much exciting stuff to say about an air filter. It fit as expected. I replaced the same exact one and when I removed it the engine side was clean and the outer side was filthy so it was doing its job!
It partially broke just when I had it mastered and was fully enjoying the benefits of a traveling sprinkler. The first thing to go was the auto shutoff. The tractor would run up the ramp and not shut off but would normally stall or topple over. This created a pond and if the wheels were still turning, torn sod.
After 2 (!!!) nights we experienced a significant decline in attacks and give or take a week or 2 more we will be able to stay outside without the bugsprays, citronella torches, long sleeves... what a relief!!

The toughest thing to swallow is that you have to dig holes in your sod.  Well, I'll rip the band-aid off and tell you that you are just going to have to do it.  The longer you wait, the bigger the reconstruction project will be.  If you're looking at the Wire Teck Easy Set Mole trap (no digging), then I have one of those too and have never caught anything with it.

NOT A VALVE
I was a bit skeptical of my lower-rpm 4 stroke powerhead being able to spin this fast enough to get up to full blower speed, but after using it I was instantly convinced that this is giving full output with my engine. The wind blast is better than the electric Toro I have which was a bit marginal, and its light weight makes it a snap to use with the powerhead.


Update: After using the Brill for several years, I discovered a newer mower that beats the Brill, and every other push mower I've tried, and it's from Fiskars, the company famous for making great scissors, paper cutters, fabric knives and similar products. Not really surprising, I suppose.  There are actually three different Fiskars mowers, but all share one common feature- a flywheel that allows the mower to chop though twigs and other matter that jams up most push mowers. The blades stay sharp, too. Meanwhile the Scott seems to have been cheapened.
This feeder made it through the whole summer and is stored away waiting for the spring.

3498	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These are perfect when the blades you bought wear down. The best part is how long they last. I can pretty much go the whole season on one set of blades.
5279	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	If you don't stay on top of cleaning these, say you let it go a year without cleaning, they get so bad that nothing will remove the grime and mold. Buying this set of replacements is an inexpensive way to bring your feeder back to like new, and no doubt better for the birds. I honestly don't think a bee guard is even really a necessity in our area, but the feeder looks better with them in place. :) I only wish I could buy them in a slightly larger pack at a reduced price, since we have three of these feeders!
works fine.
4604	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good quality and a good price. Excellent life under heavy use.
713	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got this hose to hose to replace a "professional grade" 1 inch diameter hose that was very cumbersome to move around when I water the garden. I have another Gilmour Flexogen 50 foot hose that didn't quite reach and that is the 1 inch diameter version. I still like it but it wasn't long enough. So I tried this 75 foot 3/4 inch diameter version and it is perfect! I can move it around the garden with no issues at all because it's light-weight, doesn't snag or kink, and is very flexible. My 1 inch one is still flexible in winter so I expect this one will be too. The water flow isn't quite as fast as with the 1 inch, but is still excellent. I hang the 75 footer over a hose bracket in large loops so I don't get any problems with tangling. Just pick up the number of loops you need and walk away, dropping them on the ground one by one. The hose hardly gets twisted at all. So when I'm done, I just go to the bracket and pull the hose in a loop-length at a time and I'm done. The hose is very tough and has a slick finish that doesn't snag and stays cleaner than other hoses. There's also a life-time warranty - just cut the ends off and mail them back and Gilmour will send a new hose! I don't think I'll ever need to do that though as my other hose is still like new after three or four years. The only two small downsides are 1) the hose came in a tight roll so the very end was lightly kinked, but the kink has pretty much disappeared and is no bother, and 2) for a month or so, when I first use the hose, the water that has been sitting inside it has picked up some traces from the hose and should not be used to fill a bird bath - it bubbles a bit as if it's a little soapy until you've run it for 40 seconds or so. I'm thinking of getting another of these for the front yard. Highly recommended.
DO NOT use honey to make nectar for hummingbirds. Honey ferments and causes a deadly bacterium in hummingbirds.
Pros:
1274	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It works well, and I left off the 5th star only because the straps don't have a chest-level cross-latch.  Some might find this picky, but when you have 4 gallons of chemicals on your back, that weight tends to pull the backpack off your shoulders.  As a 5'3" tall woman with good upper body strength, it adds stress to my back.  My solution was to hand-fashion a cross latch with Velcro and nylon strap.  Problem solved
6086	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The little Weber grill is great. I have a few Weber grills in different sizes, but I end up using this little one most often. I really like the design simplicity - easy to operate and clean, with all parts clearly visible to the naked eye. The circular design creates lots of focused heat, enough to sear two good sized steaks at once. We use this at home and during camping outings. Also, parts are readily available if needed (such as grates) and are affordable.

These heads are all metal construction and few parts to fail.  That is good because my cows are curious and sometimes knock the sprinklers over.  You can adjust them for full circle or just about and portion below that.  There is screw to disrupt the stream to shorten the distance and get more water close, if that is needed.  They do have an interchangeable nozzle, but not sure if you could find the parts to change them - if so, that would make them even more versatile.

9790	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Anyone not giving this product a 5 star review probably hasn't repaired many -- if any -- hoses lately.  The connectors provided at the big box stores are supposedly good to repair both 5/8" and 3/4" hoses.  Anyone who has bought these plastic and/or brass coated connectors know that they are too tight for the 5/6" hose and too loose for the 3/4" hose.  These are brass and are the right size to make a proper repair.

Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome.

3539	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a very durable blade. I've had an Edge Hog for 12 years, and have only "needed" to replace the blade every five years.  My home is on a large corner lot, so I have a lot of sidewalk to cover. Plus, I also use the Edge Hog to trench along where my flower garden meets the grass of the yard. My practice is to edge about twice a month, from March through October, so the blade sees a fair amount of use.


3256	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I bought this to replace my older B&D edger that lasted me 14 years!  There is NO comparison of the new edger to my older edger in terms of build quality, ease of use, and ability to cut through grass and dirt when edging.  The new edger bogs down and runs out of power, and the quality of cut is worse than the old one.  In addition, ergonomics really suck on the new edger, given the cheap wheel and limited space between the blade guard and blade itself. My old edger would edge through thick, moist grass and dirt (such as would be expected a day after rain, for example).  The new one clogs up and strains to get the job done.  What a piece of garbage!  Unfortunately, this is endemic in most products sold in America these days.  Companies have greatly cheapened products, and manufacture them cheaply NOT to last long (planned obsolescence). Talk about 'the fleecing of America' when it comes to the consumer.  It's all around us now, and arguably getting worse!  I'll be returning this for a refund first thing tomorrow.

5764	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Sticky stuff! This stuff is amazing! You cannot see it unless you look for it. It has little "barbs" built into the fabric so you can literally stick it to tree bark and it holds. I started tying it off but then realized there was no need on my trees since they had uneven bark. I am sure you would have to tie off to a smooth bark tree but on the ruff bark all we did was press it on the tree. On the sticky subject, it sticks to everything. I felt like I was a hobbit in a spider web. I had to just laugh and carefully untwine myself. I think the fence is perfect for small animals or occasional light deer deterrent. I am not confident it will stop our copious Bambis much less Momma Bambi and certainly not the Master of the House buck. After discussing it with some gardening neighbors and well as the person who delivered it from Amazon, we decided to change to a 600 pound test deer fence (Tenex) but am doing so with a heavy heart.

But this is a great spreader once you have it assembled, and once you figure out what settings you want to use for a typical granular fertilizer.  The adjustments to limit the pattern to one side or the other work well.  The application is also very broad and reasonably uniform if you don't limit the pattern to one side or the other.  And you can (and should) walk fast with this spreader, which allows you to get the job done very quickly.  Although I've only had it a short time now, it's construction appears to be very sound and solid.  I'm happy with the purchase and it might last the rest of my life.
3181	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Awesome. This thing works great at edging. I've noticed if you are trimming up some neglected areas, it's better to use a back and forth method. I still drop it to the deepest setting. But I use it like a scrapper on paint, just a couple inches then pull back and hit it again. After I get about 3 feet I slowly pull it backwards to the starting point and it kicks out all the build up. It sounds like a long process but goes quickly. Then vacuum it up or sweep to the center of the sidewalk and bag. I tried sweeping into the grass, but you just fill in the nice edge you just worked hard to clean out. I don't like the cord, but it beats the heck out of maintaining another gas engine.

5452	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Purchased these replacement yellow bee guards (which differ in shape from the image on the Amazon site  the guards now have a semi-globe shape), because I have the careless habit to walk out of the house and walk across the lawn, with a newly cleaned and filled hummingbird feeder held upside down.  On occasion, after a forgetful moment, I re-install the freshly cleaned bee guards before I reach the hummingbird location.  Once in a while, the bee guards have dropped out (and customarily I located them again.)  The last time I didnt.  Long story, irrelevant to the product review, I just realize.  Be it as it may, I have no issues with the bee guards, nor (more importantly) do the hummingbirds.  This past season, the guards functioned flawlessly, to the delight of our hummingbird population (and frustration of the yellow-jackets.)  The only time (no joke) the bee guards didn't make it, was when a black bear roamed the property and totally demolished all of our hummingbird feeders (no joke )  I don't expect Perky-Pet to take that into consideration (sarcasm.)

They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.
I was looking at this one and the Fiskars version.  In the reviews I read, the Fiskars model came in second (behind this one) because it's heavier and less maneuverable.  The reviews I read cited this one as the best product out there and it's half the price of the Fiskars version, so I'm glad I bought the Scotts instead.

Real nice product here lol. I was ready to return this poorly made product and really should have but than saw I had a quality wand from another sprayer from a different company that lasted a few years till it finaaly broke but the sprayer still worked so I put on this sprayer. So the other spray wand from a different company lasted years and now is still working on this sprayer,yet the one the solo came woith broke in a couplke of weeks. Unreal ! Keep in mind too that the Solo sprayer is not cheap either. The fact that Solo puts the most cheapest parts possible in building this sprayer yet charges and arm and a leg for it is sickening.

The last time I mowed using a reel mower I did it without earplugs. I did not smell like exhaust. I did not feel run down after 45 mins of carbon monoxide laden exhaust and who knows what else in my lungs. I could listen to my Nokia N810 music player streaming radio to me via Wi-Fi (GO LINUX!) My kids could walk over to me and I could stop or start with no cranky mower engines to start or stop. No flying debris being flung at my children or our animals.
The Scott is great, and great to a person like me who is a mowing monster.

The weakest part of this unit is where the garden hose connects. I am a stickler for making sure the connections are not cross threaded and I had this one on tight when all at once the hose just popped out of the connector. I put it back on making sure that it was tight but not overtightened. Again the hose popped out. When I attempted to reattach the hose the third time the connector would not accept the hose fittings. It cannot be used at all now.
Also, everything that I've covered with this netting has been free of deer and rabbit problems.  I also sometimes cover the surface of my boxes if I've newly seeded them.  I just leave enough of it so that when it come time to "tent" it, I have enough to cover what I need covered.
On this model, the bottom end, where the three (flimsy) legs fasten together under the ash pan, is badly designed and comes apart repeatedly. I eventually came up with a bunch of lock washers which, if tightened after every use will most times stay together, but its still flimsy.

6233	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I purchased this grill to use for river camping.  You can find my exhaustive review here http://goo.gl/2rgvqI .  After cooking on this grill for a few times at home to season it, I fell in love with the grill!  My wife and I often cook on this now instead of our larger Weber One Touch Gold grill.  The cooking space is incredible!  I was able to cook 4 hamburgers and an entire package of bratwurst at the same time!  Since it's a smaller grill, it requires less charcoal to cook and that saves money.  We now only use our larger Weber when we have guests.  Just like the larger Weber grills, this Weber is exceptionally well-made.  Hints of quality include the solder top handle.  Inferior grills often have a couple of cheap screws that function as a handle.  It also has a grill grate below that the hot coals sit on.  This helps to preserve the life of the grill, since hot coals are not resting directly on the bottom of the grill!  I love this thing and I dunno if it's the small size of what, but I've cooked some of the best steaks ever on this thing!  The price is great too!  I HIGHLY recommend this grill and I grill at least 3 times every week!

I'm happy to sell my gas mower; things I won't miss about my gas mower: gas, oil, air filter, spark plug, noise, fumes, changing the oil, winterizing it, sharpening the mulching blade (couldn't do that myself), the smoke when I first ran it at the beginning of each season.

fault of the owner.  I should have cleaned it
2966	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Oh how I want to write a good review but I have owned like 5 of these already.  Forget year to year it's more like 2 per season.  The air chamber on top tends to either come with or quickly develop tiny holes.  SInce it is that which keeps the pool up, once the baloon thing goes the pool is useless.  Hours with soap trying to see where the bubbles are coming from, patching, starting over... then you have other issues.. if you aren't near it when it is filling it could fill lopsided, if that happens you may end up with the filtration portion not submersed at which point you have to start over.  Should you have to start over oy vey, the hole to remove the watter takes a whole day but worse than that it's a couple inches off the ground so when it's done draining you are still left with a bunch of water in there... do you spill it out? yeah if you are Hercules, I can't, so you grab a basin and dump until you can turn the whole thing over, by which time it stinks to high H and it's riffled with mosquitoes... oh and the water treatment is as bad as a real pool, cholorine check, algae treatment, who can be bothered, you just keep emptying the darned thing.  also, the thirty day warranty is an option, sure, but once you have filled that sucker with water how on earth are you EVER going to fold it back neatly enough to return it? You aren't.  If you bought local you can drag it to the store while the kids moan the whole way but on Amazon it's a whole new story which is why i just kept buying new ones twice a year. This year however  I was SUPER LUCKY that this last one came with the same issue and had to go back literally within a day or so of me using it and the CSR took pity on me and didn't make me return the old one, I just dragged it to the trash.  So... you may ask, why the heck do you keep buying them...? Because I always keep thinking I have mastered a new way of making it work and withing the pool context it is still very affordable...

It is just the right size to keep the food fresh & clean and yet not have to fill it as frequently. During most of the year we have up to 4 of these outside our living room window and have had up to 50 birds around them at one time. We have to buy bulk sugar at Costco to keep up with the demand.

It was not difficult to assemble, just took a lot of time.  I changed the method of assembling the roof from a two person job to a one person job.  I did this by assembling one panel at a time directly to the top hose. This works fine because all the parts fit together really well.  I left the floor off until I assembled the complete roof and then snapped in the floor.

I love it!
327	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Good hose for what it cost. It does leak from the attaching part no matter which faucet we attach it to and even replacing the O-ring did not help. We don't use hoses too often so that is not an issue for us. For a small town home where we just need to hose down a porch or sidewalk once in a while, this hose has been perfectly fine. We store it indoors so it should have a good lifespan.
  Admittedly, I missed charcoal, so after 2 years, I made the decision to go back to my primal roots, so I bought the new Weber 22.5 grill, and man, IM BACK BABY!!!!!

3372	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	What's not to like about it.  If you have an Edge Hog, you have to replace the blades as they wear out.  I have a lot of sidewalk, which is what largely wears out the blade, so I usually have to buy one of these every other year.

I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate.

4.  I got the Flowtron pole for this.  So it puts my zapper pretty high up, I'm not for sure how high, but I'd say 8-10 feet high is probably where mine is.  I used the height of the pole when I accounted for the 25' distance from people.
Original review: I recently borrowed a friend's Great States #815-18 18" Deluxe Reel Mower to try on my yard. He bragged on it and told me I should give it a try. I like things labeled Deluxe.

I cut a slot in a piece of plywood, lay the trap with the trigger over the slot and step on it to compress the spring. Make sure you set the safety catch until the trap is securely set in the hole where you want it. I haven't sprung it on my finger yet but I have closed it on small twigs just to see what happenned.

I, like most folks these days, could use a little more exercise. This manual mower helps there. It's not that hard to push and it weighs less than my gasoline mower. I feel really good when I get done mowing! I think it is because I was exercising without inhaling all of those exhaust fumes for 45 minutes.

The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.
I have about 1/2 acre of lawn with the back yard sloping downhill away from the house.  I am one of those wierd guy that actually enjoys yard work.  Having a beautiful lawn for my family to enjoy gives me a lot of satifaction.  I also do all my lawn maintenance - no service here.  Long story short, for the past 11 years, I have been using a P.O.S Scotts spreader from Home Depot.  The Scotts spreader is a complete P.O.S - crappy plastic wheels that are narrowly spaced and wobbles.  It also has a tendency to tip over to the side and spill everything out.  The cheap plastic wheel was also hard to push uphill.  I finally had enough and got the Earthway 2150 commerical spreader.  Wow, what a difference.  Huge pnumatic tires that are wide apart.  All metal frame.  This thing is tough and works like a champ.  If you are still using one of those junk big box store spreader, get rid of it and get this instead.  Highly recommended.  Take your time when putting this together.  It will take about 1 hour.  Aftewards, spray some lithium grease on the moving parts.  Everything should be smooth as butter.

Is the mower easily stopped by obstacles like twigs?  Not really.  I battled with a fully overgrown neglected lawn with everything in it.  Yes if some particular sort of twigs get into the cutting wheel, it will be stopped.  But the chance is slim and it occur only once to me.  First you have to have the right kind of twigs on or near your lawn, which is unlikely. Second the twig have to be small enough to get into the cutting wheel like grass, but tough enough not to be cut into pieces like grass.  The blades are quite robust and I don't think they can be easily damaged by other obstacles.

I install and repair sprinkler systems and these are always leaking too much around the pop up shaft and are often broken.

And sometimes the bait just doesn't seem to be as potent as other times.  But when it works, the flies come from great distances and get caught, so it is worth it,

Then the music ended.  I emailed their support folks (3 year warranty!) and they said the main coil from China was faulty and they were experiencing many failures.  They notified me when the good parts were available, they repaired it, and I'm once again listening to the joyful sounds of dead bugs.  I recommend this zapper but you may want to call their QA people and ask them if the faulty coil problem has been resolved before ordering.
As Fall approaches we'll use it more and I'll be back to update on it's working order over time.

Extremely happy with this purchase. Additionally, I ended up ditching the bottom metal rack to hold coal above the pan (for ash collecting purpose). Having that rack made the coal too close to my food; I was afraid of burning my food. So i laid the burning coal directly on the metal bottom of the grill and it was fine. No burnt food and the metal bottom held out against the coal well.

1481	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	You know that this sprinkler is the real deal when you open the box and try to lift the thing out of the box. It has some serious weight to it! People love to watch it (myself included) and it takes care of itself once you take the time to lay the hose out in your yard. This sprinkler is not for you if you are planting new grass and have bare dirt showing. With how slow the tractor moves it will make mud, get stuck, and possibly strip the gears costing you additional money. You can effectively lay out ~200' of hose however it may take a few "derailments" before you figure out how to arrange the hose. The turns need to be broad and, if pulling a decent amount of hose, it can jump the track and could end up in the street. It does come with an auto-shutoff ramp however if you intend to operate the sprinkler without supervision buy a timer so that in the event that it doesn't shutoff you don't flood your yard... or your neighbor's yard. Get ready for your water bill to go up because you'll want to use this sprinkler all the time!

60	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Glad to provide a positive review to this simple solution to a failed thread.  Just cut-off the hose, and use this new hose coupling. Will save you lots of money.  No need to throw-away an old hose with broken threads.  This is cost-effective for older hoses.
First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.
Pros:
I have also used it for what it is supposed to be used for & dug post holes too and that simple 2'6" deep hole is EASY & fast to drill, even in my clay. Made setting post holes so much easier.
3814	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I like it because it is lightweight. It cuts the grass pretty well for what it is. Pretty easy to use. I have a sloping area and that takes some effort to push it on but doable. This isn't expensive, it could be wider to cut more area, but for me it is easy to use and control. If you want something heavy duty, this is not it. This is a basic push mower, nothing fancy.
3967	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This clipper is a big scissors, that's all. There's no rotation of the blades relative to the handle, as the ad on Amazon says. My pair is OK, but the spring is a real workout machine, and I'm wondering how to lighten it a bit. I find that the shears gum up with grass juice very quickly, and then the blades bind (won't open with the spring). I carry a wrung-out rag while I'm trimming and wipe the blades quite often to keep them free of drying grass juice. This works, and I'm able to keep on snipping for as long as I want. The shears are sharpenable, and the construction seems strong. I really would like to ease that spring -- that stiff spring is really my only beef with these.

Excellent product that I would recommend to anyone who hates having to go indoors in the evening due to those winged "terrorists"! I also ordered extra mosquito pads and a spare bulb.
I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.
156	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Outstanding

For the reasons above (threat to hummingbirds, threat to bears with possible fire) I no longer feel comfortable using this product and I will go one step further - I would suggest no one else use this product or any other product like it until or unless it is proven safe for humming birds and all other animals. Ive already consulted a wildlife biologist, so for me proof of safety will have to come from the same or higher authority before I change my mind.

1784	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	We are used to excellent products from Fiskars, but this one is not well-designed. In its first use, cutting off small pencil-sized suckers from a fruit tree, the blade and guard did not line up, and the blade caught on and was nicked by the lower guard, ruining the sharp edge. From time to time they seem to misalign themselves (even just opening and closing them without anything between), which causes the blade to catch on the guard and malfunction. The only positive is that the handles are easy to grip and not hard to close. We definitely won't be buying these again, they just aren't well-designed or well-made.
8459	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought it and used twice. Later realized that my problems was not fleas, it was much worse, bedbugs. It seems an interesting design and idea.
4232	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Cuts the grass like a champ. This was purchased by my wife because ironically, she wanted the exercise. We have a two acre lot that is relatively flat grass and weeds. I seriously doubt she'll be cutting 2 acres with it, but maybe 1/4 acre for the small low rider dogs we have. Item arrived as expected. It was packaged well and looks to be very good construction. Very easy to assemble (within 5 minutes). Great for the ozone since fossil fuels aren't needed. Just some good old fashioned sweat. I'm proud of my wife!

It cuts thin and thick grass clean and straight. There's something about the self powered whirring of the blade and slicing of the grass that creates a harmonic rhythm to cutting grass. It's a positive, almost hypnotic experience with good result.

6224	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We were given one of these Weber kettle grills as a wedding present (can it be) 37 years ago. We still use it and love it. Various parts have been replaced over time, and it just keeps on ticking. I did at some point get a sheet-metal sleeve made to boost the lid up from the base allowing enough headroom to barbecue a pretty good sized turkey. (Bottom diameter of the sleeve fits the kettle. Top diameter of the sleeve fits the lid.) Works like a charm.

6250	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It's very easy to bait and set up this trap, and it does indeed catch mice as advertised.  My only hesitation is that I felt the mouse was more terrified than it might otherwise have been because the trap is completely opaque and enclosed, unlike the wire mesh Havahart trap.  I was awakened by the tiny noise of the mouse running back and forth in the trap, thereby rocking it up and down, and after that went on for an hour, I finally got up at 3:00 a.m. to drive several blocks and release it!  May sound silly, but if you care enough about not killing a little critter needlessly, you might also care about its terror level, as I did!  Ultimately felt more comfortable spending the few extra bucks for the wire mesh trap.
3. To adjust ground speed, adjust wands so they do not spray straight up. angle them up at a 45^ angle to the ground. This will increase ground speed and quicken the cycle although relative water output to the irrigated area will decrease accordingly.
The Flowtron is zapping moths, which I don't want to kill, and the mosquitoes aren't interested. I bought the bait from Zoror.

I cooked a few times on a gas grill, but that for lazy people that don't have any taste buds. This grill is the best of the best.

7801	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I have gotten several of these because my field is fed from a well with the water tank up a hill - so I get just the pressure the hill provides which is about 32 psi.

5464	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This thing is a beast.  Very impressed and happy.  Just put in a pool and it has greatly reduced the bugs.  Well worth the investment.  I blow it out and clean it with an air hose about once a week and it does a better job than no maintenance.
2157	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I like this house once it was put together.

Instead of edible bait my rat-exterminator uses "PROVOKE" Professional Rat Attractant by Bell Labs. Comes in a white 8 oz squeeze tube; it looks like old dark blood, actually, and a couple of drops is enough to bait the trap. Chemically formulated to attract rats but not bugs. He swears by it, and just gave me a bottle. We'll see how it works.
Cleaning the bug zapper was fairly easy. I needed a flat-head screwdriver and a Phillips head screwdriver (kinda silly that they have two screws of each kind) to disassemble it. I used a kitchen scrub brush (like for cleaning dishes) to scrub all the dead bugs off. Then, I reassembled it. It didn't take long at all.
Now for some details and quirks which prevents the 5th star. In fact I would give it 3 stars if not for the fact that it does save me time and covers a big task far more easily than the oscillator sprinkler movements I used to do.

The push-button igniter has worked EVERY time, which I find absolutely amazing.  I'm not exaggerating: from the first time I fired this baby up, EVERY time I've started this thing the push button gizmo has worked like a charm.

2737	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Had the more expensive "HD" version for a few years until the plastic hose coupling wore and it leaked a lot. This economy model is a POS. No hose coupling so you have to turn the entire device to fasten the hose. There's a plastic on/off lever that stuck in the open position after a few uses. Very little water flow--tried to clean out the holes by tapping the end on the ground as I did with the other one, but still not working. Tried to do the right thing by contacting the company first because of their "one year limited warranty," but never heard back.

As far as adjusting disperse rates, Earthway provides two simple tables to use.  Most fertilizers provide and coverage rates.  Scotts Summerguard is 2.7LB per 1000 sq ft.

This tool comes in very handy where a regular pick is overkill.  It's very well balanced, has good design and structural integrity, and gets the job done fast. Just the right weight to do rapid, major damage without killing your arm.  Have I seen better finishes on hickory tool handles?  Sure, but I didn't buy it to look at.  This is a sturdy, well-designed, and extremely effective tool for which I can envision a variety of uses.  I detest spending good money on cheap, crappy tools regardless of where they're made.  I'm extremely happy with this tool.
This one that came with the new one refuses to work right out of the box. I called Weber to complain and they're sending a new one but I doubt if it will be any better.
This is a great addition to our yard. The light is quite bright and so to avoid annoying our neighbors, we've hung it below the fence line. That means the top of ours is only 4 1/2 feet off the ground. It still works very well.

I have a corner lot with quite a bit of bermuda, and that stuff will take over the sidewalk in a month or two. Personally, I wouldn't care, but my wife thinks we need to keep it edged, and so we do. Not sorry I bought it, and don't wish I had something better. It gets the job done, and I can get replacement blades at the big box hardware store, so no worries there.
+ Nice design perfect for controlling moth population and other flying insects
Also be sure and follow directions and place at least 25 feet from your deck or patio so bugs get drawn to it and not to where you are. It will draw bugs to there doom, seems to always be a cloud of bugs around it until it kills them all off in the area. Best bug zapper there is in my opinion.

1043	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've been using a backpack sprayer for applying wet&forget, canvas waterproofing, plant liquid food, etc. It has been great if one doesn't mind carrying a 4 gallon backpack, constant pumping to maintain pressure and topping up contents for the 4 gallon tank fairly often. I needed something that doesn't require topping up content ever so often and unused content can be returned to original container! Hence, decided on this self-mixing hose-end sprayer. Both hose-end sprayer and backpack sprayer have its pros and cons. It all depends on your needs.

I had great hopes for this thing, but it didn't live up to them.  Just an occasional zip sound as bugs got done in.  No big pile of dead mosquitoes beneath.  Not a dent on the mosquito population.

Grilling tips: you really have to let the grill do the work.  do not keep flipping your meats repeatedly, leave it alone.  you should only have to flip it once.  also, use your tongs or spatula to test the doneness of the meats.

I wonder how long this bulb will last - i've read on here that others leave theirs on for 24hrs and some use daily - I only use it when I'm out in the back or the front and it seems to keep the biting boogers at bay. I also purchased an extra bulb for this unit as well - not the one made exactly for this (with the model #) - I purhased the Stinger B1515-BL bulb for only $8 vs the $18 (Flowtron BF-35 Replacement Bulb for BK-15D). The Stinger B1515-BL bulb is actually a black light and has four prongs - something I prefer much better than the white light I got with the zapper. I'll wait till the bulb burns out to change it to the black bulb! I plan to use this for camping and will see how well this works on a deep cycle battery! Thanks for such a great product!

Of the half dozen large loppers we've used and owned over the years, this one makes cutting tree limbs/branches the easiest.  This is due to the compound action's added leverage, and, its anvil cutter (versus the scissors type), which doesn't twist on the wood while cutting, like scissors loppers sometimes do.  When there is serious trimming to do, this is the tool I reach for.  To top it off, they aren't very expensive.

I live in Colorado and this year has been bad for mosquitoes due to all the wet weather we've been having.

620	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )

It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup.

It is aggressive when removing thatch and will tear up grass that is not well rooted and established in the soil.

For small lawn areas this is a cheap alternative to power tools.
If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.

6167	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	When I started grilling decades ago it was with a Weber. I was happy. Everything tasted great. Got talked into 'gas'. It's so much more convenient don't you know. Tried several. Wasn't happy. My kitchen stove is convenient too, but it won't give me that grilled flavor either. Got 'smokers' (several) and charcoal grills (several) and final said, "What am I doing? I need a Weber!" I paid $79 for this little jewel and it's perfect for my wife and I or a group of up to 4-6, depending. You could easily do 4-5 one pound+ Porthouse steaks with room to spare. You can do a chicken or ribs with an offset fire and indirect cooking. Ideal for a couple or small family, If you're a party animal or breed excessively get the 22.5 inch. If there's always 15 people at your house or you have multiple wives get the 27 incher. I even do 'faux' smoking. Build the fire on one side and toss a chunk of Hickory or Oak kindling on the coals, put the food on the other side and put the lid on. Works just fine for a smokey flavor to your food. I know professional chefs who use the Weber at home for their own family meals and for 'faux' smoking. And they don't  WASTE MONEY on things that don't work.  It takes me 15-20 minutes for my coals to get to the point I can dump them out and spread them, but a gas grill takes 5-10 to warm up anyway. I love the new ash clearing system and the metal tab to hang the lid on the side of the grill-brilliant!

Don't use the store bought sugar mixes. They are expensive and are not as well liked as a simple sugar solution.
This unit is much cheaper than Flowtron's 'indoor' unit, and it works great indoors. I won't comment on if there are any safety regulations or anything, but its been killing bugs just fine for weeks now.

Bought one of these and put it up at the back edge of the property and it knocked down the mosquitos substantially to the point they were barely a bother.  Since then we bought a second one and always put them out in early spring to stay ahead of the mosquitos and it works great.  They are on a dusk to dawn timer so they work all night for us.  We clean them up every fall when we put them away.  Otherwise they are pretty much maintenance free.  The bulbs are a little expensive but there's some generic units out there that work just as well as the ones flowtron sells.

Unfortunately, I was never able to get the hang of re-threading the spool with new line, and would have to stop and re-thread multiple times during each use. Also, I never liked the jagged edge the weed-eater would leave along the edges of sidewalks and the driveway. So I ordered this item in the hopes of solving both problems, and solve both problems it did.

The hose is quite sturdy, obviously scuff/tear resistant, and does not easily kink. The brass fittings are designed to not restrict the water flow into the hose, thus permitting maximum water flow. The nozzle features compliment those of the hose. After 2.5 years of exposure, the hose shows no sign of deterioration whatsoever.
The blades are not incredibly sharp, so you'll be going over each area in multiple passes to get everything.

Unit received in good coindition and put on patio on Friday night. Saturday morning there were a pile of dead bugs under the unit; HOWEVER one of the two UV bulbs was out.

In the past ten years, or so, I have purchased this kind of spray wand of several different brands, including this Gilmour repair kit.  Without exception, they have all been very disappointing, with short life.  They all soon start leaking on my hand, with drips of smelly spray on pants and shoes.  Also, I often want to put the back-pack sprayer away in the garage before it is completely empty, in order not to waste the chemicals, and to have it readily available when I spot just a few new weeds in the lawn.  These wands always seem to leak so that it is easy to create a puddle of week killer on the garage floor.  I have two backpack spray tanks, one for week killer, and one for herbicide, and we have a 15-gallon sprayer that mounts on the back of an ATV for large scale spring cleanup.  All three sprayers use this same kind of wand, and it has been a source of irritation for a long time that these plastic spray wands are of such poor quality.
Cleaning is difficult, because there's no way to easily dissassemble it enough to clean the elements.
There are two holes drilled in the back and this was very easy to hang.

Assembly: It sounds crazy, but you should definitely pour about a teaspoon of dishwashing liquid inside the foam pad to help it slide onto the handle.

7658	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I live on the coast in the southeast.  The mosquitoes have been eating me alive this year.  The city normally keeps them under fairly good control with spraying, but it has rained so much that the city has not been able to fly the helicopter to spray.  I did not expect for this device to really help that much, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  I have a small back yard with a drainage ditch behind my privacy fence.  The mosquitoes are not bad in my front yard, but they will eat you up in the back yard.  I placed this about 6 feet off the ground in a tree in front of my fence.  It is about 25 feet from my patio.  I attached the mosquito lure that was included to the bottom of the device & turned it on late afternoon.  I went out as usual the next morning to refill the bird feeders ( I am usually swarmed by mosquitoes) that are near my patio.  I was amazed that I did not see even one mosquito.  Later that evening I did see 2 mosquitoes, but considering that I would normally be swarmed by at least 10 to 20 it was a great reduction in numbers!  I bought the next larger size than I needed as my back yard is less than 1/2 acre.  I bought the 1 acre size to make sure that it was effective enough to kill the astronomical number of mosquitoes that have been feasting upon me daily (also my poor dogs). The little suckers have been decimated apparently!  I leave it on all the time as the mosquitoes swarm here all day long.  I now have control of my back yard again!!!  I discovered that a long bird feeder brush cleaner works perfect to clean the housing.  The long bristle end will fit through the slats & it brushes off all the dried bugs & debris.

6) Wire type trap (like a rat trap). It fits inside the tunnel. Hard to use - the trap is directional and the tunnel must be disturbed for the deployment. My creature ran over or around it, never triggering it. The creature probably hit trap's frame and changed course. Would have been better if the trap is narrower and fits into a 1.5" tunnel.

I'll go the rest of the way with 4" casing to the water table. Works great in my soil which is mostly clay, this would work well for fence posts as well, much easier then post hole diggers.
Edit, We've since gotten 4 mice around the chicken coop with this trap.  They are usually crushed pretty darn good with their paw reached out towards the bait.

Construction is not as solid as I expected but only one physical flaw apparent; the large ring to hang it up with is not welded and has a large gap.  I discovered this when the unit fell from a hook because the wind vibrated it enough for the gap to eventually line straight up.  Luckily nothing was damaged and it wasn't plugged in.  This at least proved the unit wouldn't fall apart the first time its dropped, although I do not recommend trying this for yourself.

The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)
After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.
just a bit over a month later..  have caught about 35 rats with the victors since I started.  Escape rate is about 50% with the mod I'll mention in a moment.  The JAWS trap has a much lower escape rate but it also gets sprung much less often.

Second, my cutter bar was adjusted wrong. There was actually a visible gap between the bar and the blades.

4899	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have used hand pushed reel lawn mowers for about 20 years now.  I have a SE Pennsylvania typical yard of a mix of fescues, bluegrass, zosia grass, white clover, red clover, and various weeds, I do not use any lawn treatment, managing the health of the lawn strictly by mowing height, timing of mowing and watering during extended droughts.  That's worked very well for me.  Especially in those full sun areas where the wonderful zosia grass can grow.  I have many shrubs, trees, and bermed somewhat steep slopes.  A full mow of my 1/5th acre property takes as much as 6 hours when the grass is most ragged, yet in high growth (late spring-early summer).  More typical time is 3.5 to 4 hours.  It's a two day job.  Once mowed the lawn looks great.  I cross mow about 1/3rd to 1/2 of it -- the most used part and the most visible part.  About 15,000 pedometer steps.
Notice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a "lock on" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.


3.  Use a proper extension cord.  Don't modify a cord to make it work, this can cause shorts and kill the zapper and/or the bulb.

Fantastic price for such a high quality sprinkler.  I haven't seen high quality materials like this one has in residential grade sprinklers in years, yet the price is cheaper than most plastic impact sprinklers you could find at your local lawn & garden store.  You will need to make or purchase a base for the head, but even still, at this price you cant go wrong.

7798	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Top quality product which has worked flawlessly since I got it.  I do want to clarify that the photo of the item is that of the 25 model and not 35.  The 35 model has a rounded "spoon" style pivoting mechanism vs the square top, bottom, sides style seen in the photo.  Other than that the OEM plastic bag wrapper for the item was dirty, little tattered, and some areas of the printing were worn away even though the bag hadn't been opened.  Copyright date on the bag was 2007 so I'm guessing the item may have been in a bin for some time; but I've usually found older products to have been better made than newer ones.  One other note: I also have some of the plastic construction impact sprinklers from Rainbird and thought it was odd they seemed to work really fast.  This model and the 25 version are the slower operating ones you often see used in orchards and vineyards.  Evidently the plastic versions, with their lighter mass, just react a lot faster.  So, if you like the slow, very pleasing, lazy day sound you'll want the metal impact sprinklers.  I wouldn't hesitate a minute to buy another one of these.

It's important to note these 2 things: 1. In the summer months, if you don't empty the water for a few days after it rains, plan on having a mosquito nursery spring up, and 2. If it freezes and water's still in there... it's likely to split (I learned that the hard way!)

I called customer support and was told that a sales rep would respond to my concern. I asked to speak with a technician and not a sales person.  The sales rep responded that this is how it is designed without answering my question.  I have assembled many garden implements and have never seen this.  What will happen is the axle end will round out the inside of the wheel over time.  Poor design and even a poorer response from the manufacturer.  Do not recommend.

2218	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent post hole digger. The only thing I did different was that I secured the handle using a exterior grade stainless steel coated deck screw. the handle comes with this small nail to use, but it seemed like it would back out. By loosening a large nut, you can remove the large bolt and adjust out the blades for a maximum hole of almost 8". It says 6-8" but it is more like 5.5 to 7.5". I was still able to dig a 7.5" hole 48" deep in about 15 minutes using it allowing me to secure a 6x6 treated timber into the ground. My ground is a mix of sandy soil with some clay. Those with all clay will still be able to use it, just might take longer to dig hole. I searched all the local big box store (lowes, HD, Menards, etc.) and even TSC and all these places carry now is the crappy paddle style post hole diggers that are worthless. Glad I found this on Amazon. Not sure why it is discontinued, but grab one if you need one, you won't be sorry. It comes in a single box from amazon and already assembled, other than installing the handle. The handle only goes in one way into the stem. It is tapered so put the tapered end in one side and gently tap with a rubber mallot until it is centered. Then secure with either the nail or a screw like I did. You will see in the top center of the stem a small hole where to secure it. Awesome auger styled post hole digger that works exceptionally well.

Update: I contacted Gilmour via email.  They said I could return it at my expense, and told me a $5 fee for warranty replacement may apply.

2706	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation.

7317	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I'm probably reiterating what others have said, but if this trap does not work, then you are using it wrong. The trap must be in the path of the tunnel, otherwise it won't work at all. Additionally, do not put it in the tunnel at the point where a mole digs up to the surface to push dirt out; the mole will typically defeat the trap because they don't go through the trigger as you'd expect. Do not over-compress the tunnel or overfill it when setting the trap. If you want to put it on top of grass, try to 'cut' the path the trap will slam shut across so that the ground doesn't impede the trap. Remove small rocks and bark so that they don't jamb the trap when it closes. If you learn to use this trap right, you'll get rid of plenty of moles. On the downside, there is no shortage of moles in the world and, inevitably, you'll see more in the future. That's the downside of having a healthy lawn with lots of yummy food for the moles.

The vents on the grill top and at the bottom of the kettle work nicely.  The vents on the top allow you to let out all the smoke or trap the heat and smoke to cook those fatter steaks and burgers through.  However, it is important to remember that if both vents are closed, the tempurature will fall and the coals with go out.  This is how you "turn off" this grill, so to speak.  After all, fire needs oxygen and this inhibits oxygen from reaching the flames.  The bottom vents allow air to hit and feed the coals and by moving these you can also scrape the ashes into the catcher, a neat feature.

BYPASS vs ANVIL:  Bypass pruners are analogous to scissors, with two blades which move past one another.  Anvil pruners are analogous to a cleaver and cutting board, with 1 blade and an anvil to which the blade cuts.  Bypass pruners usually cut more cleanly with less crushing, which is usually better for the plant.  Anvil loppers may not easily cut completely through very fibrous stems.  Anvil pruners are less likely to jam and flex, and do not require adjustment.

2047	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is the first spreader I've purchased. The only complaint I have is that there should be a clicking mechanism built into the setting rate slider. The slider is secured by a wingnut which you manually tighten to lockdown, but if your not careful it's easy to silently dislodge while your using the spreader. There is a manual lever that you'll use to open/close the grate for the spreader to avoid dumping the material your spreading during turns or if your crossing pavement. It's when your opening the grate with the lever that there is a risk of dislodging the wingnut and causing you to start spreading out at a much higher rate than you intend to. It's not really a big deal if your spreading out the same compound since you'll know visually if there is something wrong. For the first timers though pay attention.

4. Another note on emptying the trap. These little guys are scared in the trap, and they look for dark, narrow spaces to hide. So make sure that when you empty the traps, you look into the two little entrance chutes on the inside to make sure that there is no one in there. It's easy to do... the chute area on the inside of the traps is not much longer than a mouse. But just make it a practice to peek in there so that you don't forget someone, only to kill them due to the factors detailed in #2, above.

Every evening at dusk, you can begin to hear the mosquitoes getting zapped. A beautiful sound, indeed... Like the Mosquito Magnets, you can't eliminate ALL mosquitoes but it makes a big difference.
All parts are metal except for the wheels, wing nuts knobs, and wheel gears.  The wheel tires are rubber, and the wheel rims are plastic.  The wing nuts knobs are plastic, but there is a metal nut inside; this was no different than my Craftsman.  The wheel gears (inside each large wheel) are plastic, but it is a thick/sturdy plastic.
A great feature is the rounded top. This enables better smoking, as air and smoke circulates more fluidly.

The only downside is that ridiculously short cord. They're forcing you to use an extension cord. My other one has a 6-foot cord, long enough to reach to a sockit weatherproof box on the ground. This one required an extension cord and there's no way to protect the plug connection from the elements. I used a silicone allegedly rainproof gasket. It's survived the rain just fine.

I used this one last summer to try to save our huge pecan trees from the intense heat wave, and it worked great! Our pecan trees are still alive and many of our neighbors lost theirs. I moved it around our trees in a spiral pattern. I moved it once in the morning and once in the evening, and it seemed to work like a charm. After an entire summer of use, it still looks almost new.

7988	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So it's been a couple decades of larger and fancier gas grills - since I felt charcoal wasn't "good enough."  The latest incarnation we bought is over 7 feet long, is gaudy in its stainless-ness, has infared side burners, dual rotiseries, all that junk...that we barely used!  Then this year, this big fancy grill has a problem...the warranty fix takes months...and it's grilling time....and so I bought this wonderful little Weber gem here on Amazon.

Compared with the old chain I was trying to replace one can see that the one I bought is smaller- too small to fit. I wasted the purchase price.

Here is how indirect cooking worked for me before this:
5652	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Ok, this chainsaw is a bit on the weak side being electric, but the Oregon chain greatly improved the cutting performance.  If you still have the original chain, spring for a replacement chain, it will certainly cut better and be safer too, no fighting the tool.  Granted, my saw is probably 10 years old, but the chain has seen very little action.  I have found that better quality cutting blades can make up for underpowered equipment.
2591	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent. Just top of the line. I expect to buy another. Fully adjustable impulse sprinkler which sends water shooting wherever you aim it, in whichever pattern you choose. How comforting to get what you pay for.
3186	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had a previous Edge-Hog for a little more than 8 years when the motor brushes finally wore out.  I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.
FYI, the attached photo is from 1 night of operation
3262	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I bought this edger along with the trimmer several weeks ago.  See review on trimmer I posted if interested in seeing that review.  Anyway, I am very pleased with the overall tool.  The only part I find lacking is the edge guide.  The blade sticks out further then the guide is and the blade is always hitting the walk way or drive way.  Even when you adjust the setting to the least amount of cut.  I would imagine this will wear on the blade quite a bit over time and bothers me but that is the only complaint I have.  The power of the unit is good for an electric one in my opinion.  I would buy it again if and when this one wears out.

670	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My favorite shovel I use almost daily around my place finally broke in two. So started looking around for a replacement handle vs throwing this out and buying a whole new shovel. Couldn't find the shorter D-handle anywhere local so of course went on to Amazon and found several choices. Prices seem to vary from $15- $40 and without being to handle and see what each one looks like I had no idea what was the best choice. This one was one of the best priced handles so just went with that. Turns out to be a really nice USA-Made handle. Stamped steel D handle end is SOLID and heavier than the original one. Has a wood handle grip on the end. Installed easy and used it all day today and very happy with it so far. Thankful to have my favorite shovel back in service. Glad I didn't get one of the more expensive versions because I can't imagine them being much better than this one. Will update review if I have any issues with use.

The nut holding the plastic pieces on the plunger of my sprayer had rusted on and I couldn't get it off without breaking it, so I just replaced the gaskets and nozzle and that alone was enough to help refurb the pump plunger.
Keep in mind this is a push powered reel mower. It is going to take multiple passes at different angles to achieve a precision cut quality. This will cut tall grass, it may leave stray, tall, dandelions though.

Sometimes they use the rail to sit on, sometimes they just over to eat but this gives them the choice.
2 years later and I am replacing all 3.  Why?  Leaking sprinkler heads wasting gallons of water a day, muddy spots around the sprinklers. When the valves turn on, water squirts out from the solenoids.  I have checked all three valves to make sure they weren't closing properly due to sand or something else jamming them slightly open. They were all fine.

I was also worried about my cats getting heart worms (transmitted by mosquitoes). They mainly infect dogs, but cats CAN get them and they can be worse for them because the worm knows how to reach a dog's heart, but will end up in the cat's lung and there is no medicine for it. The worm will eventually die and rot in the cat's lung (not good.)

166	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Well built.  I have rented one of these (same model) from my local garden supply store for several years.  It is a great spreader.  Packaging the item came in was poorly taped and the bow was just about to come open.  Inside the Amazon box was the manufactures box.  There was no padding inside either box so parts had jostled around a bit, some parts got scuffed up, but everything was there.  Assembly instructions were adequate but could have been better.  Tools needed to assemble include a Phillips screwdriver, 7/16 wrench and socket w/wratchet, and a pair of pliers.  Assembly time was about 45 minutes.
Now, there is one more detail that makes this solution work even better.  I only need one spray gun assembly for all three sprayers.  I use 1/4-inch air hose quick connect fittings to easily switch this new beauty between spray tanks.  Search here on Amazon for "air quick connect" to see these parts.  At the end of each of the three hoses that come out of each sprayer, I fitted a female quick connect fitting, and on the inlet end of the wand I fitted one male quick connect fitting.  Even though these fittings are for intended for compressed air, they work just find for spray liquid.  This stops all leaks, even when the sprayer is left full, with the wand disconnected, there have been no leaks.  It is a ten second process to switch the wand between sprayers.  (You must put the female fitting on the end of the tank hose in order to seal the hose when the spray gun in removed.  If you put the male fitting on the hose, the liquid can free flow out of the tank.)
I fully recommend Weber's Smokey Joe. Now, I'm hungry. Time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats.

This year, I finally made the purchase and have been completely satisfied with how this edger has helped make my gardening projects a breeze.

8957	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	perfect fit
6491	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Because of its large capacity, when the Perky-Pet 209 is filled with sugar water, it weighs 56oz or 3 1/2 lbs. Unlike many other feeders, the hanging wire doesn't fit around the glass bottle, instead it has a screw-on plastic top which has a wire threaded through it. With the short (7") and thin flexible wire supplied, you can't just bend the wire into a hook shape, you must tie a very sturdy knot at both ends of the wire (not that easy, even with a thin wire). Or, you must scrounge a better wire that is strong enough to hold the heavy Perky-Pet and yet thin enough to fit through the tiny hole in the top of the plastic. Or, get out a drill, drill a larger hole and use a decent piece of wire to hang the darn thing. If the new wire is too large though, it will interfere with the cap screwing onto the bottle.
1460	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Very pleased with our new clippers. They are sharp, cut 1/2 -1 inch branches very effectively with a comfortable grip. The lock is secure. Great price for a good tool

2927	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Purchased a pack of these Rain Bird 1804 sprinkler heads to increased the coverage area of a system I was preparing to install. So far that have worked like a charm. As stated by another reviewer, adjust the "throw" distance by turning the collar.
3095	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works great and now my sidewalks and driveway look great.  I had a massive amount of overgrowth over the edge of my driveway and the sidewalk in front of my house.  This worked like a charm and cut through everything with ease.  I would advise to use a higher setting and progressively bring the depth down if you haven't edged in awhile. If you start too deep, it will just tears things up without cutting through it.  Starting higher will give you a much better defined and better looking edge. I wasn't able to use the lowest setting due to the way the cement was poured, as there is an edge that sticks out from under where the form boards were, but not an issue for me.
520	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works perfectly and looks great!

And....it beats dragging 50 foot hoses around the 3.5 acres we own....
3643	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I just use my edger for edging the lawn by the sidewalk and driveway. This blade does NOT edge straight. It CHOPS and MUTILATES the grass instead of leaving a smooth straight line. Having gone from a straight edge blade to this blade was a HUGE downgrade as far as the quality of the cut goes. Also, the blade is short, and I have to put the edger on the lowest setting in order to get into the dirt where some grass is below the surface. Granted maybe this works best for digging or trenching but the blade is horrible, IMO, for straight edges.
7353	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great addition to my inexpensive trimmer. Saved me from buying and storing an additional gas engine.  It easily attaches making the swap from the trimmer to the blower very convenient.

Purchase again?  YES
880	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My original broke and I had missed it for years, so I finally broke down and bought another. I love that I can set up my hoses and cover such a large area. And the stop mechanism is so great, as I forget that I have the sprinkler on, sometimes. It is heavy, but I hope that means sturdy!. It is so much easier, than moving a sprinkler around all the time

3) The stainless steel grate is just OK, but far better than the Chinese junk.
2 He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.
2. We have caught four mice (out of 20 tries)
All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.

8055	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Catches so many bugs, it's unbelievable efficient!


9247	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	Straight out of the box, this didn't work.  Yes, it sat in the box - inside our house, not in a garage - for a couple of months (not so many bugs out in November, when I bought it), but that shouldn't matter.
I kept him in a tall vase because it was Thanksgiving and we had guests over and I didn't want to drive out to release him and he escaped from the vase overnight!  (Lesson learned: mice can jump over 10 inches.)  I wanted to slap myself for not taking him out the same day (my wife wanted to kill me......).  So I set the traps again and boom: caught him again within 2 hours, drove him about a mile and over a bridge, and let him out in some fields.
No rust so far, but in case the flavor bar does start to rust, it can be replaced for $10.  The cooking grid and flavor bar are small enough to easily clean in the kitchen sink.
I just bought another one because I needed a longer one
8512	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Product is as advertised.
For our lot, one blade has out-lasted 7 trees felled and cut into fireplace logs, average trunk base diameter 23" (ranged 18" to 30"), average height 28' and is still cutting nearly as well as it did when new.
Very pleased.
5732	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	It worked fine for about a week and then blew itself up. iT RUPTURED AT ABOUT THE 3/4 POINT SO WE HAD TO TAKE IT ALL BACK UP AND BUY SOMETHING LOCALLY.
3501	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It works very good.
6264	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills and thats not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill theres no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it aroundonce lit this unit isn't going anywhere. Also, theres no place to put the lid once its removed the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that its a perfect grill for the two of us, its easy to assemble, its built rugged and its easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle when its cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you're good to go.
2062	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	You know its funny if you look closely at the photo or youtube it you'll see a thin piece of sticky adhesive sticker around the arm, its to cover an indentation grove I'm thinking its what the makers machine uses to hold the arm while forming it. They could have done a better job then that bout it's ok for a hatchet but I was hoping for move stability when using it but that could be just me... seems well made so far.. Not meant for a guy with big hands like myself but again its well made, I'll use it every now and then
8654	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	THis product did not work in my home.  I do not think it was the product but we needed something different to combat fleas, like chemicals. THat's why I did not give it lower stars:  I appreciate the price and quick delivery.
8362	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	For a reasonable price these remnants proved fine for extending one pesky hose that was just a little bit too short.
1503	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	A very fine set of trimmers that you will be very pleased with
185	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I got this for spreading salt and it functioned perfectly all through a New York State winter. The spreader is very reasonably priced and strongly constructed. It does take some effort to assemble the 2150, but it's not rocket science and just requires time. The hopper holds plenty of salt and the plastic mesh strainer top ensures that you don't dump in salt clunkers by mistake. Even if you do accidentally load a few clunkers, the design of the sliding door salt port at the bottom of the bucket is easy to access and clear out. My last spreader didn't stand up too well as most of the metal parts corroded away from salt exposure. This unit looks like it will last a long time.
2729	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This product is great for delivering water directly to the root zone. That's where the roots are. So, this product puts water right where it is needed most. I used to water my trees with my garden hose from the top like everybody else. It took a lot of time and I never knew for sure if the water was going down to the roots. Now I know the water is going down to the roots because I put the tip of this device into the soil and down around the roots. Then I turn on the water and my tree(s) say, "Thanks, I was very thirsty. You are the best caretaker ever.". That makes me feel good to know that my trees appreciate my efforts. My neighbors are jealous because they don't know why my trees look better than theirs. I'm not going to tell them my secret because I don't really like my neighbors very much.
3403	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Perfect replacement.  Just be warned, you need a 2x4 or other long block to wedge the blade up against so that you can torque on the nut to get it off.  I shoved a sledge hammer handle  into the grass chute and wedged the blade up against that while I used a socket wrench on the nut.  Easy.
4224	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I have used it very little, but enough to know I wish I did not buy this. I wish I could return it..... It feels weak, like it is going to break. Also the blade split apart like a set of Bypass clippers do.  Waste of money in MY opinion
9024	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Worked great
7873	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The "brass" coupling, the part below the threaded piece that screws into the tap that spins around, leaked very badly. I can't see the hole, but as much water was spurting out of the hole as was coming out of the other end of the hose. Useless.
942	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Nice durable sprayer. Great for liquid products, such as weed killers. More work, if you are using a crystallized product, such as Miracle-gro lawn food. You have to mix it with water and strain it through a paint strainer, which you can buy on the cheap at Home Depot. You have to use a different setting for this than for a liquid. Thing is, they give you good instructions on how to do it, in the booklet that comes with it. It's very durable and accurate. You can turn the tip on the front to spray up or down. I read a ton of complaints about Miracle-gro sprayers, before I bought this one. Not disappointed.
9381	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This unit lives up to the reviews I read before purchase, got two of them to cover 1 acre and works great.
8694	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Product as advertised, works great, would purchase again.
5393	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Ok for the $$... suits my needs as a fire pit insert instead of a BBQ.  If grilling was a focus I'd kick in for the next step up which has better venting.
The only improvement I could see them using on this would be to put a little weight on the bottom of it because if the ground is not completely level it falls over sometimes when one is pulling the hose out.  Not a biggy,...still works.
7944	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	It's a 15' hose.  This is the second one I have bought.  First was a gray neverkink, second was a standard green.  Ends are not high end, but neither was the price.  If you need a short hose, this is the way to go vs getting a 25' one, as you can buy a few if needed to get what you want.

7921	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We already had one and take it with us when we camp. This one was a gift for our son-in-law. We had been invited on a picnic with the family and he had taken his full sized BBQ in his truck to the park. We had brought along our Weber which worked just as well as his and was a lot easier to transport.

1869	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great little clippers. They are easy to operate, and the leverage is very good. They will cut through some pretty thick branches

The grill arrives disassembled in a compact box.  Assembly is quick and easy.  A Phillips head screwdriver is the only tool needed for assembly.  Once assembled, the grill sits quite low to the ground but works pretty much like the larger Weber charcoal kettle grills.  There are vents on the top and bottom of the kettle to adjust heat, and a shallow ash catcher sits below the bottom vent.  The ash catcher is not removable, though, so dumping ashes is awkward.  For such a small, inexpensive grill the actual grilling surface (14 inches) is quite large and can easily grill several steaks or burgers all at once.
1353	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Plain and simple hose nozzle. Comfortable to hold and does straight to fog streams.  Seems solid and should last a while since I never drop my nozzle but place it down as common sense should tell you to do.

THANKS
I placed the Flowtron 15060 in a location where I have been testing the Flowtron BK-80D and so I knew what to expect in terms of mosquito catch.  The results of my testing has lead me to conclude that the Flowtron 15060 is more efficient than the Flowtron BK-80D in zapping mosquitoes.  Actually, it is quite remarkable.  After dark, the Flowtron 15060 looked like a miniature firework display.  A video that I took demonstrated some 28 zaps in an approximately 17 seconds and most of them appeared to be mosquitoes (see URL below).  They were so intent on attacking the zapper that they seemed to ignore me while I took the video.  I purchased another Flowtron 15060 for the other side of my house, which is near a pond and this year has been plagued by mosquitoes.  I need to wear a bug net and overalls to do anything outside.  Yes, revenge is sweet.

So I but the lesser quality figuring that they'll have to be replaced a couple of times a year anyways.  The fact that this very inexpensive flag is still flying 8 months later pleases me well.  It's up about 20 feet, 7/24, and sees winds averaging 5 to 10 mph on a 'normal' day with the occasional storm friont gusts reaching as high as 60+ mph.  So far (8 months later) it's just now starting to show a little fraying on the ends.  I'll be buying another shortly to have ready when this one finally gives in.

These days it seems that we often complain that stuff we buy is not the same quality as what it was "in the old days" but here is a solution to acquire a high quality spray wand that will last for many years and perform superbly all of its life.  The only downside you might find is that this brass assembly is a little heavier to carry than the plastic spray wands.

7466	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Well, this is a nice little grill and very portable but for the life of me I cannot find a store that carries the canisters! It does not use the normal 16 oz canisters that every KMart and Walmart carries, it uses the smaller 14 oz canisters that it seems no one at all carries! Even the specialty camping stores in my area don't seem to have this size canister so unless you plan to hook it up to the large 20 lb propane tank (which kind of defeats the purpose of it being "go-anywhere" I'd suggest getting a stove that uses a more standard size canister. I ended up buying some online and paying some rather expensive shipping charges for hazardous materials. But at least I have enough little canisters now to last awhile. It really is a shame is does not use the standard 16 oz canisters, what were they thinking? I'd rate the grill about a 4, but the poor choice of canister size is a real killer for me.

The flies aren't as interested in it as I would have liked, but there may be some fly attractant to put on the unit in place of the mosquito stuff that comes with it; I bought it more for the mosquitoes than the flies, so I am very happy with the results.

It's amazing what you can cook on a BBQ when you put your mind to it and when you don't want to be slaving over the stove. We do diced red potatoes with olive oil and rosemary in foil; bacon (!!! - yes - BBQ'ed bacon is delish and easy to do - cook up a half pound or so and put the cold slices in a zip lock in the frig and pull them out to microwave in the morning); chopped broccoli in foil; grilled asparagus right on the grill; quartered brussels sprouts with olive oil, garlic, and a slice or two of chopped pre-cooked bacon in foil; even baby-back ribs, chicken, and rib-eyes - they all go on this great little Weber.

It will use more electricity, but I intend to put it on a sensor, so it will run dusk to dawn.  As others reported, we found a pile of carnage after the first night....mostly mosquitoes.  Read the instructions about locating and baiting....ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub, patio, and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us, and intercepts those coming from upwind.  Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported, and the "zapping" is not obtrusively loud.

Very strong spring, had to have hubby pry it open and it wasn't easy for him either so be prepared for that.  Heavy duty trap, may have been a bit overkill when I saw the tiny mole but I guess it needs the strength to close against the dirt
The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.
Perhaps it is just the model I received, but, one is at guess as to how far we thread in the head nozzle for the best mathematically performance, especially when it arrived with a loose threaded nozzle head.
Save your money on more expensive nozzles and buy this one right here.

I jest! Our champion kept zapping and zapping until there was a pile of charred black and yellow corpses underneath it. The BK-15D, having tasted victory, would never again relinquish the chance to meet glory in battle. The next day it reported bright and early ready to face the enemy anew.
The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.

Whoever said to use the drill rather than the crank was one smart cookie! I'd been turning that crank for days!
2507	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I find it  extremely annoying that some guy thought it wise to slam a giant staple in the end of this otherwise beautiful shovel handle. This means the consumer  paying for the shovel handle must fight to remove the staple and then sand down the burs created by  prying the metal loose that was shot into the fiberglass.  The staple must be removed or it will surely interfere with the  intended use of this product. I have purchased many products from Amazon over the years and none of them arrived damaged in this way. If the  manufacturer or other handlers are intent on continuing this practice, then in all fairness, the handle should be displayed at the Amazon website with the giant staple stuck in the  top of it for accuracy as the staple becomes part of the handle and removing it renders the handle damaged goods.
Of course, with a live trap, you then need to decide on the path of the mouse's dispatch.  But these ethical dilemmas are easier to deal with when you have removed the pests from your house.

But BEHOLD: around 7.30 PM to 8 in the evening when the sun heat started to recede, the party began... it became a NON-STOP zapping. I literally mean 1 or 2 a second. At it lasted all night. The kids even complained that the thing kept them up all night (had one right outside their window which was open, but with bugscreen;)) . We ran out after day 1 and there was a gray circle below the Flowtron on the ground. Just insect parts. So many it was gross.
I'm obsessively intolerant of leaks anywhere.

I do have put them on timers not to work during the day (I might revisit this if the day-biting becomes a problem, but so far not yet), and the key to this seems to have it on even during evening/morning hours when the device is still in deep shadow.
2. There's an adjustable 4-holed air vent at the bottom, identical to the one on the top cover you see in the photo. This can be closed, but if you do it reduces air flow significantly. If you leave it open, the fine powdery ash from the briquettes drops freely out the bottom onto that shallow round aluminum plate. The slightest breeze or movement will send that ash flying all over you, your guests, and the immediate area.

Functionally, this works just fine, it was my fault for buying such a long hose. It does its job just fine, though.
I replace bulbs about once a year.  I leave 4 of these bug light on 24/7 to cover 3 acres situated on a private lake.  Without them our mosquito population is pretty bad.  Easy to clean them with compressed air...I take them down from their hanging positions and, outside my workshop adjacent to the house, I blow the bug build up off the grid with an air nozzle on my air compresser hose.  In our case, cleaning occurs about once a month during high volume bug season.  I do store them inside the workshop during winter months.

8329	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Yup, I like it, it works great.  Wish I could have bought a longer one, but it's just fine, sturdy, solid, tight contact with the spouts.
8737	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works extremely well.  Note to clean the trap thoroughly after each release so that the metal will not tarnish.  But great for holding mice for a few hours between releases - unlike tubular mice cubes, which are plastic and whose hinged doors can  be chewed in very little time so as to be useless for future use.
878	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Replacing an earlier model  50 year old!  Need I say more, works great.  Mainly used for weed killer.
7478	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	perfect kit for my sprayer very good seller
330	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Used to plant my garden works wonderful..

8508	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought these refills to go with my Victor Ultimate Flea Trap. The trap is incredible! It works great with no problems what so ever. Will purchase these refills again when it comes time in a few months.
I will concede that the seeder is very light and made of aluminum and plastic, but do you really want a portable seeder that is heavy and cumbersome to balance?  If that is what you want, then buy a pull behind planter and use a tractor to pull it.
I used it for light duty stuff only for about two hours, nothing more than 1/4" diameter stems and branches (I carried a pair of gardening shears for larger stuff), never abused it or hit anything solid with it.  It broke for no apparent reason other than simply swinging it.
Thank You
- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.
The townspeople stood in awe of the sight of sparks flying as if summoned by Thor himself, and billowing smoke rolling off the foolish assailants. Yellowjackets, it was supposed, had keen sense of smell. It did them quite the disservice as the aroma of burning comrades only made them attack with even greater vigor. The BK-15D, with a warrior spirit that would make a Klingon blush, basked in the added challenge.
8286	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	great for my use.. well made
the product is ok for my small works on my backyard garden

389	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I would highly recommend this nozzle. It is sturdy and rust proof, and the water stream works great for washing cars. Very high quality.
Spray your mattress with Ultracide and under cabinets.  This has a strong smell. Do not spray this near animals as they have sensitive noses!  Let dry and aerate house.

We purchased this when we built our home and it's been over 15 years now.  I have had to order a replacement part from the mfr. and it was very reasonably priced and their customer support folks are a delight to deal with.
5482	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The ones I got when I ordered these do not look like the picture they are rounded on the edges and this make them a tight fit. I do not know any other way to discribe it. They just plain work better. Glad they were inexpensive to replace.
7160	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have used this brand of trap before and they work continuously, trapping and killing flies by the hundreds.  Thanks.
2867	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	these things really work!
8653	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	The hummingbirds are starting to migrate and some of them stop by to grab a bite. They love to sip on this nectar and we enjoy watching them dine. We have two hummingbird feeders separated by the driveway. The reason for two is that the first one to the feeder likes to fight if another hummer stops by when it is dining. Now the loser of the fight can cross the driveway to the other feeder to chow down.
bad quality control -  issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sized

9775	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Unfortunately these are very poorly made, one strike with a weed waker breaks the little green hose connections, The adjustments are a JOKE, easily strip with large flat blade, small flat blade or quarter. These adjustment strip in both ways the threads strip so it won't close all the way and turn off water and the flat blade slit strips so you  can't adjust it at all.


It will make you happy for a long time to come. Besides, if civilization as we know it comes to an end you can cook with wood or make your own charcoal. Do you know how to make your own propane?
9993	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	When I first used this tool, I raked a tiny space of my yard, approximately 3 feet by 5 feet. I ended up with a bucketful of thatch and general yard debris to remove and felt ashamed of of myself for not taking better care of my grass. Any tool that can shame me is probably a tool that does a good job. This rake is also very sturdy and solidly built. Yes, it'll take a while to de-thatch a large yard with nothing more than a handheld tool, but rest assured that the job will get done, and you will remove tons of debris with this rake.
7535	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	As expected
No way will it catch the monster of a mouse/rat that I saw in my backyard. I think it is a little disingenuous that the dimensions are not revealed. Returning it.
2664	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have left these in my goat pasture with the animals for summer and winter irrigation. Through freeze and drought they continue to function without flaw or adjustment. This spring I will pull them and oil them up for another full year of use. Orbitz ones only last a few weeks. These are champions.

Whatever the reason, I found this mower on Amazon and was intrigued by the idea of a clean, quiet mower. The fact that its cutting method might be better for my lawn was just a bonus. No gas or tune-ups? Even better.
7231	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's a great and excellent fly bait. It attracts flies immediately even if the jar is full of flies. But the smell is awful, day by day  becomes stronger.
9181	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This bug zapper really works well. I posted it in my garden and it gets all those pesky moths, whose offspring were feeding on my plants..Low energy use, about 13 watts. Not for mosquitoes. Sturdy and well constructed.

It's only supported on one end of the reel which is 50% of the problem. Add that to the fact it is plastic and you have a poorly desugned product.
If my rubber hoses get a kink in them I just give them a slight twist and they work fine. I have 3 black rubber garden hoses. One of the rubber hoses that I use I have left under pressure (70 p.s.i.) 24/7 for maybe 7 years, in freezing cold and in 114 degree heat, and have never had a problem with it. That is not to say that this red rubber hose will perform the same way but I am betting that it will.

1296	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I just tried it for the first time and it works so much better than the common garden-variety sprayer. It delivers a very powerful stream, up to about 20 feet, with just a few quick pumps. After dispensing the full 3 gallons, my shoulders felt fine. My pumping arm was getting fatigued by the end but not severely. It seems to be a quality device but only time will tell.
5903	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Easy to assemble, well made. Just right for 2.
You can eat like a gourmet anywhere  you tote this to!  Just add a cooler full of longnecks.....
8902	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	it rained and rained here recently so we are now inundated with mosquitos.  I know these lights don't "elimiinate" bugs.  They might attract them if they are nearby anyway, and "IF" the bug flies into it, obviously it will kill it.  What I am saying is this:

**********
Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.

Exhausted with that, I finally bought these because they weren't PLASTIC, and they look like the
3938	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	My yard consists of mostly weeds and has lots of tree roots. Even so, this mower easily keeps everything below a few inches. If I fall out of my routine, I may have to bring in my trimmer to hack down the patches of longer stuff before resuming, but overall, for me this beats troubleshooting/fueling/smelling a gas mower and dealing with electric cables/charging. I try to hose down the blade after each use and sptriz on some WD-40 to overwinter.
7509	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	perfect

2206	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Easy to put together, sturdy, love it.  Good material and seem to be able to hold up well with our winters.
Our house had not been edged for several years when we moved in. I bought this product for several reasons. I like electric as it is cleaner and quieter than gas. It is also lighter and does not need the engine work that all gas powered products need on occasion.
4961	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Works very well for planting, strong easy to hang on to and balanced.

8748	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	We're almost through the 2nd summer now, and it's still ok - no corrosion damage.  I leave it out in the rain, with the vents closed, and it seems fine.  It's great with the hardwood lump charcoal for steaks - sear over the high heat, then smoke indirectly, covered, away from the heat until desired temperature (a remote readout thermometer helps).  Indirectly with a Smokenator I have make many pork butts and beef rib roasts.  Quality equipment, this.
I could spray this forever and nothing would ever seem to empty from the sprayer. I would disconnect the bottle and see the material drawing up the straw, so I know it was sucking, but the bottle never emptied or more like a 100 gallon sprayer as it would take forever which dilutes the mixture. I think for what I was using it for it wasn't strong enough to draw the solution out of the container and actually spray it.. Maybe it has enough to draw up the straw but never enough to mix with the water. Otherwise I can't explain how I could water my lawn about 2500 Sq Ft for say 25 min and the bottle remained full..
2495	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	my wife was injured at work and the only thing she was able to do was go out and water her garden but was not able to turn water on and off so we just left the cheep Walmart hose's on they kept bursting and breaking and kinking.
7500	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I've tried 3 other mole-trap designs with limited to no success. Without a doubt, this is the trap that gets the job done, every time. I have always used the simple directions supplied with the trap, with no customizations.

4960	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I gave it 4 Stars
Edited to add that I lent one trap to my dad, and he's had even more success with it than I did.  Eradicated his mole problem.  Only complaint is it works so well, we didn't get to use it a lot.  No more moles!
My father's Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon's Search field brought us directly to this listing.  Unfortunately, we only discovered the mismatch when our shipment arrived and we found that it was not listed on the back of the carton containing the chain.  A visit to the Oregon website (also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice.....even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states "Fits Echo, John Deere and Sears Chain Saws" with no reference to Remington!!! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon.  That advisory is not included on this listing!  So, it did not do me much good to shop on Amazon versus visiting the local "big box store" when their listing resulted in the shipment & my return of the wrong product!  Are you going to reimburse my time/$$ to return 3 chains?  Come on guys!  Do you really monitor the responses to your "Did we miss anything?" links?
I actually put washers painted yellow in the lawn with roofing nails (bright orange cap) so I can lay the hose exactly where I need it.  From the road and even walking in the lawn, you can't see these "markers", you just have to have a good idea where they are situated.  This eliminates the guesswork on where to lay down the hose if I have a curve since the hose layout has been tried and tested.
9233	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have three of these working around the clock at different spots around the house.  Last year I couldn't go outside for more than 5 minutes without getting eaten alive.  This year I haven't gotten bit yet and I was even out while it was getting dark cutting my lawn.  I would say these work. My other two units have bigger lights but not sure that its necessary.
9998	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Only complaints is that i wish i had purchased sooner! Combs out the dead grass super easy. Works great and feels like a great quality tool.
2215	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought the 12 room version of this house about 10 years ago.  It has held up extreemly well.  It does take patience and time to assemble, but well worth the effort.  The extension pole which I set in concrete works very well and I have had no problems with the lock on the sections.  I recently moved and intend to set it up again.  As soon as a colony is established I will be buying another of these houses or adding more floors to the one I have.
8277	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Worked great, nice to have a short hose some times
I have not had any noticable decrease in mosquitos on our property, but I do occasionally hear it zapping, so I know it is working as it should. There are mosquito attractants that produce CO2 to draw them in. I may have to give them a try as this just isn't as effective as I had hoped.
9076	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I needed an air filter and this one was perfect replacement.  I didn't realize how bad my original one was till I took it out to replace it.  This fit my John Deere Tractor perfectly.  Quality is fine and will be buying more in future
4006	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	it came promptly
The first night we turned this on was the first night we could be on our deck without getting eaten alive.  We live close to a creek so the bugs are VERY prominent and it works.  Holy cow does it work.  It works well. Especially when there is something big enough to cause billows of smoke to come out of the hood.  Not burnt electrical smell, but burnt insect smell.



The new blade makes the edger work like new and has held up all summer
4251	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These "puppies" do the job really well and I like the "green" color as it blends in with the plants. Also the price was great, too.
256	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Very good hoses. This is one of those get what you pay for times. Buy cheap hoses you throw away after a year or 2 or just get these and be happy for long time.
2745	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Excellent product

works fine.
7476	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Thanks

9488	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Draws the bugs away from the porch when in use and eliminates them for good.
Keep at it, mow a little more frequently, and come at the lawn from different directions and pretty soon it will look like a golf course. You will want to take off your shoes and mow barefoot. This isn't as burdensome as one might think if you enjoy the outdoors and don't mind a little walking. It is not a job, as mowing with the power mower in the heat of the day once was. I don't really care that much what the lawn looks like; but just enjoy the quiet meditation and exercise after a long day sitting. And if the lawn ends up looking great afterwards, well there's nothing wrong with that.
7037	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Superior bait. The stink starts immediately--which is just fine = thousands of flies will be overwhelmed. If you have another brand of fly catcher adding this powder will enhance--guaranteed.
6183	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Have used these for the past 20+ years.  Definitely the best.
7421	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I received my order for this on April 30, 2014. One year later I had to replace the bulb. Now, late November 2015 the whole it quit again. I replaced the bulb but that didn't work so took it to an electrician who found the transformer to be unrepairable. It lasted than less than 18 months.
Now I have my own weeds to pull and this sturdy tool does the job.
6495	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Killed a mole on day one. Simple to set using the supplied Pinchers. Not difficult to set in the least like other reviews. I watched a couple of YouTube videos and set it. No digging was required. Fantastic product!
834	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Make sure you clean it when done!  Otherwise excellent!
9044	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good
5792	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	I've purchased rolls of Deer Screen before and this was by far the weakest of all the products. Tears too easily, just isn't worth the time or the money to install. If you have to be careful installing it, then it won't stop a deer..
1029	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	it works fine, does what it's supposed to do!
So I found this netting. I decided to give it a try. I was able to run this netting over my fencing, and then on top over the chicken area. So far, it has served two purposes. Birds can't get in, and chickens and baby chicks can't get out.
4052	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Yard shears. Item as described fast shipment.
Also if you are worried about pain death is in an instant due to the large spring, and there are no batteries to worry about going dead...
3636	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a great replacement for any gas-operated grass trimmer. The design is simple, the plastic body is very durable, and the device works as advertised.

9227	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Oh I'm in heaven. My first night without being attacked by bugs. I read the reviews and I knew I needed something heavy duty and strong as I'm in an open valley with a stream 20 feet away and full of flys, mosquitos and all kinds of bugs and it was driving me insane and ruining my evenings. You probably will need an extension cord with this as the cord is just a few inches but now i have one. Put it up today and NO BUGS. No Flys, mosquitos nothing and I help my neighbor. Actually I hear it going off right now. I've heard it's really important to clean this regularly. This is a major zapper and it's going crazy now.
1) Creature likes wet area. It is most active right after watering. For the purpose of trapping, you can make a tunnel "flavorable" by keeing it moist between watering.
2980	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	An excellent product and terrific service.
Makes a nice clean cut, handles are easy to grip and the button to close it works well.
6460	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	As stated.
Other than those minor items I think that this is a really great product.  Keep the blade sharp, the mechanism oiled, and occasionally tighten the nuts and these will be a great investment.
1614	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Nice but it says to make sure to wash hands after use can cause cancer??

4624	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	great
2604	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Performs as expected.
9457	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This thing rocks! I live on a lake and the bugs are horrible at night- they coat my windows trying to get in at the light and opening a door lets in a disgusting tidal wave of various creatures that die overnight and cover my tables and counter tops.  However when this baby is running, almost no bugs show up on the windows, even around the corner without a direct line of sight! There is a non-stop (literally) crackle coming from around the corner with bugs meeting their end by the thousands when I have this running at night. Tip: if you have the volume of bugs I'm talking about, don't place it near an open window.  The burning insect smell is not pleasant.  Money will spent.  I've even brought it inside to get rid of the above-mentioned tidal wave on a few occasions. I will note that mosquitoes still like people more than the light if I'm out on the deck. I did not really buy it for mosquitoes however and I have not tried using the included mosquito attractant so I can't fairly judge it there.
4053	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These are easy on the wrist.
2407	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I've been using these for years and they last a few season of abuse. The only complaint is that it is often hard to detach and attachment since there is a small area to grasp the sliding part of the connector.
740	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS.  SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE. KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES.
3801	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Sturdy with a sharp edge. Just great for me garden work.
7653	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	the hummingbirds love this and so do I,  I have this hanging from a window hook and the birds love it,  I like it because the bird cannot land,  they fly in and drink and move on,  at my other feeder when they land they seem to fight each other more,  it also great that it doesn't leak as easily as other,  my old one would leak half the food if the wind blew so this is way better,  also if your carrying it through the kitchen it won't leak so that's a plus
6983	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	works great good product!
I'm really excited to see how it works in the summer months when the mosquito's get bad. I will update then!
7741	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	It's a Weber, what else is there to say?
The legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. Given time, a bit of bumping around and general abuse, and the screwed on legs might turn askew. If you notice this while the grill is hot, you've a problem. The solution is to keep them tight during non-use.

Edging is easy. It takes more effort to get out & put away the cord than to edge. (After the first use if you haven't edged in years)
Don't forget to buy the bottle brushes or you will struggle to clean the container.
3089	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Really disappointed. I'm in a bad mood today, lot of stress.  And I was expecting to be able to take my mood out on B&D.  Because, I knew for sure this edger wouldn't live up to expectations. Well . . . this thing is fantastic!  I'm not a fan of electric yard equipment.  Usually wimpy.  But this did 480' of edging (both sides of a walk + patio and drive) without even breaking a sweat.  And in most areas, it hadn't been properly edged in 2 years. Easy to control.  Easy to manage. Very little vibration.  It's a great product

The same tabs the became brittle from weathering broke again on a new feeder.
It has been great fun to just watch or play with on a hot day when needing to cool down.  It is frankly mesmerizing and relaxing after a complicated day at work.  The large wheels have no difficulty on low or high speed moving smoothly through grass that is at least 3-4 inches in length. I typically choose the slow speed for a deeper soaking and water once or twice a week.  Most of the time it navigates well over a coupling used to repair the hose.  On rare occasions if the hose-coupling protrudes too much it trips the shut-off value.  The sprinkler has only failed to stop once with the included brake.
rake between bushes though. You mess them up and crack some under branches if you use a big rake. This does fit in there pretty good but gets stuck on roots at times and with leaves. I would say this is more for under bushes than in bushes.

2496	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I don't know about anyone else but I am happy about this hose. I am in my sixties and feel the amount of lead in making this product is no big deal. You get most of all your food & outdoor products from China, most all people seem to buy them without question. It is a hose and not a food container. Look, I have had my hose for 4 years and water stays on all the time. I can grab the hose and turn on my fire-hose type nozzle and water what ever. Does it kink, the answer is yes. The good thing is, the hose seems to never break down. Take your time and unroll the hose and make it straight and you won't have much problem. Other hose's once they kink they seem to fail at that point, but not this hose. Take your pick, the industrial hose or the typical green hose. I'll take the Red hose. Have fun with your pick.

I feel fairly certain that the attractant that comes with the product is powdered, dehydrated flesh of some kind that starts to putrify after being rehydrated. I say that with some degree of confidence because while I purchased it to deal with houseflies drawn to my dogs back-yard droppings, it has drawn about two to three bottle flies for every one housefly.

My daughter has a huge, covered back porch that runs the length of the house and a smaller one in front. There is a lot of foliage surrounding the house and bugs, particularly biting ones, tend to be bothersome. The porch is not screened in, so I bought bug zapper to see if it would help and it does!

4475	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	First I have to say that this is my first reel mower, so I have nothing to compare to, and my motivation for this purchase was not to be green, although it's nice to know I'm being green when using it. I bought this because the Tiffgreen sod supplier recommended cutting with a reel mower between 1/4" and 1-1/4" high.  Tiffgreen is a Bermuda hybrid creeping grass; so given the low cut setting and the fact this mower is specifically designed to cut Bermuda creeping grass and was the only one I could find in this price range, it was a no brainer.

2463	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This flag replacement works great. Our flag was the old metal type that you have to lift and then turn it down. Well, a LOT of the times the pull up was forgotten, and the flag was bent almost in half. Only took a couple of those til it broke off. This went in easy, in the same holes from the old one. (Removing the old rivets was NOT fun..) One nut on the inside, and it works great. It is a much more simple up and down, one motion. Maybe this one will last a while! Well Made and Recommended if you need a good replacement flag.

2) "All the screws fell out" - Sigh. The machine has two bolts (pre-assembled) that hold the rear wheels on. It has four screws (pre-assembled) for the cutter-bar adjustment. And it has eight screws and nuts for the handle assembly that you installed. Let me guess which screws fell out. These machines come with aviation-style NyLoc nuts, which may make the screw feel as if it's been tightened when you still have a ways to go. If your handle is still loose and floppy at the joints, or if you can still turn the screw easily when you take the wrench off the nut, you haven't tightened the nuts down.

It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.

I purchased the 1705-16 near the end of last mowing season and have only used it through half a mowing season this year, so I cannot accurately speak to the long term durability of the product.  It does help tremendously to clean the mower off after each use, and keep the blade oiled to prevent corrosion.  I have not yet had to sharpen the blade, but it seems like a reasonably simple process.  As a side note, I can speak to the durability of the optional grass catcher attachment  it is a piece of junk.  Do not purchase this optional attachment, as it will not last likely beyond its second use and it does not work in the first place anyway.
4974	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	The reviews are accurate.  It sucks.  I thought as an Engineer I could figure out a way to make it work, but instead I saw that its to flawed of a design to bother as the mower (Great States 415-16) is also to blame for the useless nature of this grass catcher.

BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don't require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.
Pros:
360	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	This hose is a kink monster.  It must have 4 or 5 pressure killing kinks in line right now, the polyurethane seems especially prone to kinking.  Funny, it's connected to my 12-year old Sears Premium black rubber hose that I purchased for half the price and it's holding up without any issues and I've even left it out during winter snows.  I will try to post a picture, but the hose that was shipped to me is not the same hose pictured.  Mine is light green and may be 8-ply, but it's the flimsiest 8-ply I've seen.

The teaspoon conversion adapter is okay, but there should be some kind of marking on the dial to tell you what the what the default measuring units are (tablespoon or teaspoon).  This can be important if you need to reacquaint yourself after a season without use or if you let your family member borrow it.  Also the arrow could standout more, so the user can rest assure its on the right setting.  Maybe it should have been painted "black."

There are some pretty good videos on the web about how to properly set this up and I followed them step by step with no luck. Those little furballs just keep tearing up my yard!
The only flaw I've seen, and I had this with both pair, is that the adjustment screw loosens and will not stay put when re-tightened to proper tension.  It keeps coming loose no matter what I've tried.  As a last resort, I've even tried replacing the lock nut under the screw but that did no good either.  To cope with this flaw, I have to carry around with me a Phillips screwdriver and a pair of pliers to hold the nut while I re-tighten the screw.  Frustrating flaw in an otherwise fine instrument.

If the model can be located, the comment will be updated to include it to help others choose the size they need.
I unpackaged all parts.  My complaints regarding the assembly are due to the lack of easy to follow instructions.  The parts list does not specify quantity of the different size bolts (easily remedied by measuring).  At times the instructions are a little unclear.
chemical companies have to recall their products often due to adverse effects like killing species of fish (runoff) causing algae blooms that kill creatures necessary to the ecology and so on.

9266	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	How is it that appliances know just when the warranty is up? The product manual says it has a limited 2 year warranty. We bought it November 2011 and it lasted till January 2014. Checked the troubleshooting guide in the manual and first we ordered a replacement bulb which didn't make it work. Checked the outdoor GFI socket, it works fine. Its not the house fuse/breaker. Only thing left in the guide is the "starter", so we've determined that its broken. As to its performance while it did work, it was on nearly 24 hours a day for just over 2 years and it did its job well. Lots of bug zapping, mostly at dusk and all night. In the last couple months without, we've noticed a huge spike in skeeters! We are buying another one! If the next one lasts as long, that works out to $15 a year in bug control. (if the bulb lasts too) You can spend that in a snap on lots of other ways to kill bugs, so we will stick with this. We already have a spare bulb!

7140	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	At first I didn't want to pay for it because 9 dollars for 3 small packages was a little bit too expensive for me. So I made my own, I used the most disgusting things that available known to man lol. Guess what? Nothing! My mix didn't attract a single fly, I mean not even one fly. I continued to let my mix cook under the sun for a couple days, still no result. But as soon as I mix the bag into my mixture. BAM, thousands of flies flew in like nobody business lol. My trick is that, after the container is full, I use the strainer to get all the flies out and reuse the mixture. It works like a champ and save you ton of money. As long as you continue use the sauce, it will attract flies. Top off with just regular water as you like.
5260	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These work great and the best thing is that they open up to clean.  The old ones don't do that and they help keep the bees away from the nectar.
SO - was it worth it? Absolutely. The mower does a great job on my yard, and has held up well over three years. It's light, which I like - the last push mower I used was my granddad's, and it was pretty much built out of ship timbers and cast-iron locomotive parts. This model adjusts a little higher than most others, which seems to be good for St. Augustine. And, maintained and properly adjusted, it's not really any harder to use than a push power mower.

4027	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	1)  As noted correctly in a previous review, it is critical to attach the lower end of the handle to the mower unit FIRST; then attach the upper half of the handle to the lower half.  Otherwise the handle is impossible, or nearly impossible to attach to the mower, as the directions call for.

2475	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Needed a extension hose to run under the deck to hose real.  Definitely heavy duty and no worries it will bust without turning off water.  Quality materials used in hose construction and hose connector ends.
Dislike: The "hardware" is very cheap, the screw to hold the handle on the top is not correctly sized, even when tight the handle wobbles; the legs and the bale which serves to lock the top on to carry it are also very thin, cheaply made.
I have a distaste for the clamshell post-hole diggers that drove my purchasing decision. I did find, however, that the clamshell digger would come in handy in spots where this auger was unable to dig. This auger had difficulty in spots with tree roots (even smaller ones), which is to be expected as that is not the designed intent of the auger. The post hole digger is more capable of chopping up small roots. Also, the handle of the auger would get in the way for digging post holes near structures such as the house, which is where the lower profile clamshell excelled.

Hanging doesn't help.  You'd do better trying to hang the flies.  This is pretty much useless for bug control.

4699	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	these things never do a good job. rarely do they water close in and the center adjusting screw just doesn't work most of the time. on some the spray seems to go up in the air at least as much as it goes out. with this water emergency we are having you would hope Rain Bird and the like would come up with a design way more efficient than this. i am fed up with replacing NEW nozzles in an effort to find one that will stop my grass turning brown just 6 feet from the outlet.
When edging a walk, it can take a bit of care to ensure that the blade doesn't strike the concrete; I wish the guide was a bit larger to make that easier, but after a little practice you get the hang of it.
Very effective and seems bulletproof.

The BK-7 model worked okay, but quickly clogged up with bugs (pretty much each night).  After about a week of this, it shorted out so badly that it melted a hole in the plastic part which held the wires apart.  That was the end of that.  The BK-7 model used a series of round wires that go horizontally, but this tended to trap the bugs.  Even with constant cleaning, it was always giving me problems.

They are great for making triangle cages for perennials, just add green plastic tape at various heights and your perennials will stand up all season.  I even use them to prop up lavender plants.  They are great for staking transplants in their shipping pots.  In hard ground, you'll have to pound long screwdriver in first and then insert the stake. I continue to buy these season after season for additional plants.  They are just for simple staking jobs, where you don't want to use a plant ring or a metal cage.  Just keeps the plants upright. Do wear gloves when handling them from the package, as the dye will stain the moisture in your hands.

8874	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These totally work, but a cat works better.
Meanwhile, I tried some other saucer shaped feeders near this one on the same window.  The results are very interesting.  The Hummers prefer this feeder to all others by a 2:1 ratio.  I have to refill this feeder twice as often as I do the others.  Same food in both.
TYPES OF LOPPERS

1135	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I had one and lost it in the garage or lent it to someone, this is a replacement item. Great for spraying chemical around the property.
2538	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Quite amazing product.  I added 3/4" pipe extentions and bored an irrigation water well by my garden.........got to 21 feet down then the rock stopped me cold.
1992	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This pump works exactly as described. The one I purchased is now in my portable shop "swamp cooler". I got tired of replacing the normal swamp cooler pumps every year and the solution is a submersible pump. I have had this for a long time. It is used daily for the hot summer in Arizona and is still working fine. I highly recommend.
8675	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	So we are on a 4 1/2 care property with chickens and horses and a small pond. I ordered this because of these annoying gnats that come up from the gravel and soil and they drive us, the dogs and horses crazy. Without the mosquito bait the gnats go to the Flowtron from and zap, their toast. Since its not mosquito season yet we put bits of burger in the bottom and it draws the flies in to. I noticed the horses stay within the 1acre perimeter of the Flowtron when resting. We have only had it up 2-3 weeks and I have noticed a HUGE drop in the gnats and flies.

Dull blades? Hard to believe, but some folks know how to SHARPEN them!
2052	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great product
1990	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	If you are looking for a solid, basic rain gauge this is the one to purchase. Can easily read from the house, durable. We of course brought it in when the weather got cold due to freezing. Sometimes simpler is better!
5546	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I am using this to deter hawks from eating my ducks as snacks.  So far so good.  It's very light weight, I put it over a chainlink fence in the wind with no problems.
343	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I have had this hose for 9 years.  It has withstood freezing temperatures, including the coldest winters we've had in 100 years.  It has been stretched, coiled, pulled around corners, stepped on, and generally abused as a garden hose can be.


1751	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Works perfectly.  Variable spray (not sure why others had issues)  Never had a plastic one last more than a year, so being metal, I'm optimistic this could last a few years.
After doing some research National Brand Walking Sprinkler has made in the USA all metal geared sprinklers for not much more. I guess you get what you pay for. Thanks China and Cooperate Capitalism for filling up our landfills with plastic crap. What a waste, these used to be made with metal gears... FOR A REASON!

9154	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Working like a charm! Great product. Zapping those bugs away makes me very HAPPY!
6177	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Arrived on time. Seems to work great and the hummers were visiting it within only a few minutes after placing it on the window.
954	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This seems to work quite well on a new lawn. It does "walk" as described and doesn't overwater.
This is the second grill I have ever owned in my life (well, actually it's the third, but the first one wasn't really a grill in the same sense so it doesn't count). The previous grill I bought from that massive retailer whose name must not be mentioned here but it rhymes with "wall-cart." That one cost me $100 and featured plenty of plastic covering and side tables. I only mention this because it's my only frame of reference here.
6225	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This was exactly what I wanted. It's small enough to bring to the beach, and large enough to use at home. We had one of these when I was little, and it's still the best.
This is kind of funny to watch - - TWO humming birds will STARVE - they'll spend all their time chasing each other away from the feeder.  THREE birds work out fine:  While 2 are off fighting, the third one gets to eat lunch.
WISH I could find onea them toDAY ----
My old ones are still fine, they still coil up easily and are still flexible.
457	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Love this nozzle. It's very high quality and delivers the amount of water you need with a simple twist. We're gradually tossing all our poor quality nozzles and hose connectors with quality items that we aren't cursing every time we turn the water on.

5755	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Husband says it is doing it's job in the garden ! ! !
6631	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	Nasty little rats.  2 nights.  4 traps.  2 rats.  I bought 4 traps, some of them are a little hard to set, but they work great.  I do recommend 2 modifications: (1) Make a slit in water bottle lid (along part of the side parallel to the flat round part of the lidP.  You can then slide it over the copper bait holder to make a tub style bait holder.  This allows you to stuff the lid full of peanut butter and jam a piece or two of dog food in there so that rodents have to dig or lick out the tub --- sure to set off the trap.  (2) I screw my traps to the end of a 2 ft to 2.5 ft 2x4 or other piece of flat wood so that the rats can't take off with the traps (like they have done for me before)... and so they can be emptied without ever getting near the rat.  The metal spring part of all four of my traps sticks out far enough that it is easy to catch it on a rock or stick to open it (from the distance of the 2x4).
One interesting aside, after purchasing this an extra blade started popping up in my "other folks that purchased things similar to you also purchased this" windows.  Which leads me to wonder how long the blade lasts, or of folks are getting one as a spare (which I will probably eventually do).
3314	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	fits and works
All perfect to me. I leave it outside all the time
UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality...for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured. From the sound of it, there are various colors and quality issues. The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings.
8255	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Fits in the flea trap perfectly.
8681	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Humming birds seem to love this stuff, but water and sugar works too.
I fully recommend Weber's Smokey Joe. Now, I'm hungry. Time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats.
2489	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Great Hot Water Hose. Not to hard, coils up nice.
2645	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	extcelentttttttttttttttttttt  sprayer strong pressure  i am  handy man
I've only had it a week so we'll see if it lasts...like I said, if it can last a few months that is fine with me.  I'll update my review in a few weeks ......
If I had any complaint it would be that, if I'd known the straight rectangular mounting hole would fit I could have gotten the blade cheaper elsewhere, as I found there were MANY blades with that hole available. But then, if I hadn't gone through this process I would not have known that.
8250	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Using on my patio. Seems to work fine.
Further update, still in great shape.  No kinks, still easy to handle (doesnt have a mind of its own).  Buying another 100 footer now.
9246	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I'M SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS "SHOCKING" UNIT, I MUST HAD KILLED OVER 100.000 BUGS IN A TWO WEEK TIME. LOVE IT.
7410	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I'm usually all thumbs when it comes to things like making fire happen but even I could figure this thing out. The ignitor was a little tricky the first couple of times but I eventually figured it out. I bought this thinking that a little grill this size is great for a single person but when I had to cook for seven people it had enough room to handle several pounds of chicken at a time.


2628	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Good product.
3254	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This edger does the job and more.  I give it my highest recommendation.
ps -I'll be 72 in June and this was a piece of cake to use!
2907	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These sprinkler heads save you a lot of watering. I can turn on my system and run it for 5 minutes and not get the same results with my hose in much more time. I put this together with a splitter on my hose outlet on the house and some rainbird tubing. My lawn looks pristine and with minimal work. Digging these in only requires a little work with minimal dirt removal. Anyone can do it with ease. Prior to installing this I had the saddest lawn on the block but now it's the best!

I did not believe the low starred feedbacks saying the lids did not fit or seal right. Thought Weber was just about perfect. Well I was wrong. My lid was OK but my base was bad. Not quite round.


514	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Sturdy.
3856	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this to place in the flower garden in front of my house because the plants don't get enough water. But, it's too difficult to lay the sprinkler hose so that it doesn't spray on my windows and masonry. Good product; it does exactly what it says. But, my application was wrong!
7981	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Surprisingly well made, especially for the price.  Added it to the discharge line of a large dehumidifier; and, wrapped a used nylon sock on the outside end.  Works perfectly.
2277	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	This is a good feeder the only problem I had was it was too easy for sparrows and other small birds to cling onto and eat.  Too many birds would cling onto it and the same time. It does help feed the birds and give them all a great chance to eat and enjoy the suet!
I always washed it clean. Followed direction etc. This is not a professional tool.
4268	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	had a little trouble at first but once use to it am finding i like them.  they cut really well and i have a lot of bushes and other things that they are doing just fine on.
2303	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought this roller for regular maintenance of my Bocce Court. It was very easy to assemble and fills easily with water. The plug seems well made and hopefully won't leak water in the future. Because of the rounded edge, it does not leave marks when turning. I find it very easy to maneuver but because of its weight you must use caution near any slopes or hills.
671	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I ordered this 9 years ago.  When not in use, I drain the water out of it and leave it outdoors.  It still works perfectly.  About the only thing it cannot do is work in mud.  Mud is what you get if you water bare dirt with no grass on it - once I got some grass growing (9 years ago), it worked fine.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  I loan it out to neighbors from time to time.
6372	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Caught one small young mole. The remaining moles push dirt through the traps not setting them off. Have tried relocating the traps changing, angles, resetting the triggers but the moles avoid them.
1139	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	fiskers is to pruning what butter is to toast. twigs, sprouts and limbs melt like butter
9658	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	ok
5313	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	2.0	Instructions on how to use bait are terrible. Not sure if I have it on there right or not...  Tons of bugs flying around that never come  to get zapped.  No way this covers 1.5 acres.
I would buy this feeder again.
9706	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These quick connects are exactly what I expected. They seem to be well made and work fine.
8225	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	These are great. I could probably make my own short hoses but this was too easy and not too expensive.
1979	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Got this pump to replace a Beckett pump I've had for 8 years and it finally gave up.  This is a slightly larger pump and works great.  I use it from late March through early November in the fish pond (300 gallon) and this one has great water flow and keeps the pond well aerated.  Very happy with this pump.
1.  Keep it away from people.  The insects swarm to this thing, so if you are anywhere near it you are getting swarmed to.  If you hang out in-between the zapper and the bugs they will buzz you on the way to the light.  Stay away and stay out of the path.
9180	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I haven't install it yet, it's raining everyday in Florida and unfortunately I cannot leave it outside.
Outstanding axe in every way. Steel handle. Nylon cushioned grip gives good traction grip and also absorbs much of the impact.
3675	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is the second one of these saws I have purchased.  The first one an iron bar fell on it and broke the handle.  The blade is extremely sharp and is replaceable.  It cuts on the forward stroke but even more on the backward stroke as there are 3 teeth at different angles.  When you don't have a huge tree and don't want to bring the chain saw out this is the one to use. Highly recommended
Our family of four- all good eaters - we have no problem cooking food for all of us on this grill; steaks, burgers, ribs, or dogs...with room for foil veggie packets,  and being charcoal it's easy to finish off with toasted buns.
7301	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	No more cleaning dust, grit, bird poop, and all the other detritus of city life off the grill all the time.  Looks sharp with the white-emblazoned Weber name accenting the whitewall tires of my Weber grill, too.
Not so with this unit! Great price and solid quality!
3087	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I was surprise that it worked so well.  I wasn't actually expecting that much but I have been using a string cutter for years and this cut my edging time down..
8730	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	NEG	1.0	I won't recommend this product. Only kills bugs that won't bug you in the first place.
6160	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I bought one as a gift for my son who loves my charcoal grilled steaks and burgers. I've used the Weber Smokey Joe for a long time and I like it's size for small grilling  jobs.  I also have a 22 inch Weber that I've had for 20 years. You can't go wrong with the Weber Grill and the Smoky Joe is a staple on my patio
5639	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	4.0	I usually buy a 3 pack and save a little money per chain.  Good chain as long as I do not cut on too much hard dead wood.  I just look at these as use, get dull, throw away, put another on.  Only use a chain saw about 4 times per yer.
I used both and they worked fine for my purpose of balling and burlaping.
5089	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Destroys flying insects!  I need to clean it already due to its massive effectiveness.  Flys, moths, and mosquitos are virtually non existent in my yard now.  My dogs ears are grateful and so am I.
Ed
PROS:
Don't leave food out for more than 3 days in warm weather and clean the feeders well each time.
August 8, 2012
8355	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Use these to hook up various pvc connections in my garder watering system.  Great length and price on these remnant hoses.

6711	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	I use the Perky-Pet feeders in the winter because they are window mounted.  The receive just enough heat to keep them from freezing when temps drop a few degrees below freezing.  When temps drop in the low 20's I bring the feeders inside and put them out each morning.
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This is a product fall in that category. It doesn't attract anything, it might be killing fewm while others festive around you drinking your blood.
5705	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	This is a good little grill.  Very handy and durable.
8657	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	makes birds happy
7132	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	One of the best chains. i like this brand.
9635	Patio_Lawn_and_Garden_5	POS	5.0	Has been in use for 2 years now still works great.
