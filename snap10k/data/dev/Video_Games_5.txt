2629	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Game Boy was a gloriously fantastic handheld back in the day. Things couldn't have been better for Nintendo....until 1998. That's when things went up a notch for the Game Boy line. People don't want light. People don't want thin copies of the system....okay maybe they still wanna fit it in their pockets, but what the people were asking for...is color.
This game is almost like watching a full blown movie. I loved the way they told the story, almost like a comic book, which is really cool. Bullet-time is also a nice feature, for a video game that was really original and almost every game has tried to copy it since.
Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.

1848	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I got a great deal on this used PS1 game. My girlfriend plays this classic game and enjoys it a lot. She's not much of a gamer. The disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly. There's a few tiny "cracks" within the inner ring of the disc, but this is common and DOES NOT affect the actual disc itself. It seems like an alright game to me, just not my style, which is why I gave it a 4/5. But a lot of people seem to like this game. It's a great kids game as well.
Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Music 5/5 Powerups 5/5 Overall 10/10 = A+
Storyline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating!  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing!  Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate.  You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes!  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what's happening.

What made this game the best in the series? Well, it took what was good about the first game and multiplied it many times over adding two new characters to the Resident Evil Universe: Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie R.P.D. cop fresh out of the academy and is reporting for duty.
Bloodlines came two years after Super Castlevania IV and while IV has some better graphics and definitely some better sound quality, it has its own merits. Sure, you go kill Dracula... so what? Actually, the plotline itself is a refreshing change from the others. In this one, you can choose to be either John Morris or Eric Lecarde, which allows a different change of pace of having just one character to start off with (faintly similar like Castlevania III for the NES, except in that game you start with just one). The graphics are essentially good for the Genesis, so I have no complaints (YES, they're better than the NES).

The story is amazing, and only Final Fantasy 10 has really compared.  Final Fantasy 6 was such a great title, that I never thought anything could top it, but FF7 just drew me in and didn't let me go.  I couldn't believe the intrigue, the depth, the complexity of the story.  I found myself on edge at school (I was in high school when it first released) and I couldn't wait to get home to play it.  When Cloud goes against Rufus near the end of the Midgar arc, I knew I loved this game.  When it took over 2 hours of game play to get to a world map, I knew something was special.  And when the game cuts (in real time) to the CG of Junon's cannon, I was stunned.

548	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This wasn't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64. I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone.

5083	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Unreal Tournament is the new model for what a FPS should be. The graphics are great, the sound is amazing, the level design is absolutely top notch and very creative. Perhaps the best part of Unreal Tournament is the number  of options that you have out of the box. As your skills improve, the game  can continue to challenge you on single player with adjustable AI. Of  course the multiplayer is where the game truly shines. Getting online is  simple, so you will be fragging your friends in no time. If you like this  type of game and have not played it yet, you are missing one of the best  games to come out in recent years.
The game is smooth to play, making it easy to switch from item to item, without breaking a sweat. The story that goes along with this game, has enough twists and turns to go with a hollywood movie. Just when you think you know what is going on, something else happens and throws the story in a totally different direction. That is what makes the game so good, the graphics could be worse than they are, and this game would still be amazing.

Now, you follow the exploits of Raziel, as he attempts to exact revenge on his creator and betrayer, the vile Kain.

Still, there are better options to  get what you want out of a Star Wars game.  "Rogue Squadron" is  an infinitely better single-player space game.

You can sneak through levels stealth with your silenced pistol, or go all out nuts with the AK.  This model of game would go on to influence ALL future fps.  PS3 & xbox fanboys take notice!  If rare hadn't come up with this formula, Modern Warfare & Halo wouldn't exist as they are!
THE BAD

-----------------------
4129	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	The game is honestly one of the best games ever, However it has huge performance issues on modern computers rendering the game virtually unplayable. If you are a stubborn die hard fan like me you will play it this way anyway. Nobody plays online anymore, who can blame them with the problems operating the game, so do yourself a favor and just play starcraft 2 or something else.

 Overall, RE2 is an excellent addition to the series, and expands the original game to new heights. Since it's available on multiple platforms now, it's very easy to come across. NEW FANS SHOULD START HERE, OR ALSO THE GAMECUBE REMAKE, THEN MOVE ONTO THE OTHERS.
The popular summons make a return though in altered form. In FFVIII summons are called Guardian Forces or GFs for short. The great thing about the GFs is that each must be defeated in battle before gaining the ability to use them. It's a fantastic design decision by Square that lends to a sense of accomplishment. GFs in FFVIII are similar to party members in that they have levels and experience points and can take damage in battle. Each GF also has a list of abilities that can be learned by earning 'AP' (ability points) in battle. The abilities include things like upgraded HP or increased attack power to very specific abilities that can be utilized by your characters.

Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption.

3589	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Sure Dreamcast has it's place and is now resting in the video Game Graveyard, but this system was good, very good. But the thing is people wouldn't trust Sega, after failing one too many times and being the underdog in the gaming world, so they had a feeling the DC would fail as well. But it's potential was great, it had many great titles such as Soul Caliber, Shenmue, Sonic Adventure & 2, Crazy Taxi, the list is endless, the grpahics are amazing. The system is very loud though, the engine makes alot of noise when loading the disc. They stopped making games for this system so if you are planning to buy it, buy all the games you can fast because they are being taken off the shelves of many stores. The sports line for the DC is fantastic bolstering some of the best sports games ever made, thanks to the 2k series. If your an RPG freak well they have great ones as well like, Skies of Arcadia, Grandia 2,Record of Loddoss War, just so many no matter what you are a fan of. Don't let all the bad comments get into your head, because if you think it's bad, you are going to belive that it's bad. Remember you need a VMU for the DC for the best playing experience, or you won't be able to save games, most game take up 10 or less blocks unless it's a sports game which takes up a huge ammount of space, like 150 blocks! An extra controller would be a good idea as well. This is a great console that just wasn't given a chance. Enjoy!

Bottom line...BUY THIS. Its one of those games like a good old nintendo game with a good  story and pure fun. ENJOY!!
If there's anything I have to complain about this game, they are really just nitpicks. For example, the concept of Buzz Lightyear shooting around despite being a toy is awesome, but Buzz himself seems to keep contradicting his developed persona in the film; he every now and then spouts a sound clip from the first Toy Story, back when Buzz was delusional and thought he was a space ranger. It can also be a bit bothersome falling from a great height when trying to reach an area involved with the mission you would want to accomplish.

If they would stop the hand movements and tried harder on the voices, the game would be perfict! Don't let the voices discurage you from buying this game, thair is so much to this game, let me talk about replay value, almost every puzzle in the game is random, so you can't just use the same solutions every time through the game. Let me talk about the nemesis, he's a 8ft(I think) tall monster that makes frankenstein look like a whimp, with a tenticle that spews poison at you, and equipped with a cannon. He sounds dangerious, you face him more than wonce in this adventure. After much time playing this game you could tell capcom put much time in this enemy, and he has the only voice in the game that is not annoing, as he only says "stars".

They were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that, in itself, makes it another great effort from Konami. It really reminded me alot of the older Castlevania games, yet in 3-D. Despite others mixed feelings on the game, I really enjoyed it. My only gripe, however, is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its' platform areas in levels. Once I made it pass those parts, it was great. One, in my opinion, that was worthy of my hard earned dollar. Although I love the 2-D Castlevania games a great deal, I do hope they make another game like this one in the future.

You can preform combos, special moves and things like that, it's much the same as Mortal Kombats style of game play. The commentary is not annoying, provided by Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler.

-NO CHARACTERS AND VERY LITTLE STORY. Tails wouldn't show up til the sequel, Knuckles and Amy Rose were down the road a bit, and everyone else was just a thought. So that leaves just Sonic and Dr. Robotnik. The plot basically boils down to:"The animals have been captured by Dr. Robotnik. Sonic is here to rescue them." That's it. Supposedly, I heard that the Death Egg ship was being built during this game's timeline, but it was never officially mentioned, so I'll consider it separate from the Sonic 2, Sonic 3, and S&K continuous stories.

The most common complaint about this game is over its controls.  I assume that this is somewhat exaggerated, however.  My system falls well below the minimum requirements listed on the box, but it still played well enough.  The only frustration I experienced was that the Stranger would sometimes turn too quickly or too slowly, and that would render the more precision-based puzzles very difficult.  However, I still made it through and enjoyed the effort despite my weak computer system.  Some also complain that the camera angles at times interfere with gameplay, but I found that they helped create mood and suspense, and at times when it mad fighting difficult I would just move to a point where I got better visibility (this is less of a problem with auto-aim, but it does sometimes get annoying).

4717	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I recommend this game to anyone of any age.  Although it has some nudity / blood, I think it's tame enough and reminiscent of the original era that it's more education than anything for youngsters under 10.  The music is probably one of the major perks.  I've downloaded and listened to the music on MP3 players driving around because it's THAT good.  The gameplay is simple as can be:  sidescroller, jump, attack, item, and magic.  There are literally hundreds of weapons, armor, etc items to find, it's amazing what some of the more rare special weaps do.  The game itself is pretty long too, once you beat it, you beat it again upside down and all monsters/music/items are changed to reflect your stronger levels.
Of course that would take a master stroke in storytelling, something videogames aren't known for. Videogames are not literature. For every decent videogame story, there are 10 books as satisfying as eating a meal. Game stories are intentional experiences that happen a specific way. If they don't happen that way, then the designer has to account for that, or face an endless web of possibilities. Games are dumb at telling stories. Even games that give you plenty of dialog options are bogus because the end result is the same. At the end of FF7, there is only one outcome. This is a role-FORCING game.
X-wing was the first but later on Lucas-arts improved the engine by adding TIE FIGHTER (that's right a game where you play on the side of the Imperials) this also provides some very challenging missions but can be beaten with much more ease that anyone could ever beat x-wing.  Still fun, just as enjoyable

Some enemies are more powerful than others and it takes longer to kill them.  If you knock a guy off of his lizard then you can jump on it and ride it around slashing at the baddies.

5562	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This title is still a must have for any action gamer. I use it most to play deathmatch using the "Weapons of Destruction" mod. But there has been soooo much developement using the Quake II platform, that almost any gamer can find a mod they enjoy. Moreover, with the state of the art graphics cards, you can turn the resolution all the way up and not take a performance hit. As far as game play, it is still one of my favorites. I actually prefer it over Quake III. Quake III is just a bit too fast and all the levels are very similar. Quake II has the most variety (that is, once you get out on the internet and start downloading new mods/maps/models). In addition, Q2 has a single player, story line, game in addition to its deathmatch stuff. The other reason I like this title is that you can play it reasonably well on a laptop. My laptop is just too slow when trying to handle Unreal Tournament, Quake 3, or Star Trek, Elite Force.  All in all, a must have; it is fun, and there is lots of variety out there to tweak the basic version.

The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.

1441	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Even though this game is almost 4 years old-it is still one of the best games that the N64 has to offer.  Why?  Well dear reader I will tell you why.  SUPER MARIO 64 is a gaming revolution,  it was the game that everyone had to have.  It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere.  The world that is inside Princess Peach's(aka Princess Toadstool) castle is immense and highly imaginative.  Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that) it is still a sight to see.  As far as play control goes, it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around, but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze.  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer.  The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing.  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact), and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside.  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game, in fact no mention of him is made either.  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2, but alas they didn't.  So if you own a Nintendo 64 and don't have this title, or are thinking of buying a N64, then get Super Mario 64 because it is by far a true gaming experience.
This game is wonderful and very intense.  I suggest you order this from Amazon as soon as you can.  This game is awesome and will make you very happy to have bought it.  One of the main reasons for that is the replay value.  It is very high.  Higher than most games created by Konami.  ENJOY!!!
Sidequests are great in number and require much brain power, and the games added bonus is the FMV sequences.  Breathtaking graphics, it is hard to imagine the ps1 could handle such images as this game produces but it does and we all love it.
Carnivores takes place in the far future, where you are the newest client of a dino-hunting corporation that's set up on a planet in space.  Yes, the story is non-existant, but at least they tried to give a solid reason why you're hunting dinosaurs with a shotgun.

Again, you can choose from barbarian Ax Battler, amazonian Tyris Flare or dwarf Gillius Thunderhead as you slowly plod your way through a generic as hell fantasy kingdom, hacking and slashing at conveyor belt enemies (who sometimes kill themselves out of sheer stupidity) before you get to the big guy in a suit of armour who has taken over the land because of his evilness or whatever nonsense.

VI - The best story in the series.  Play this one, if any.  The world is beginning to reach epic proportions now.  The graphics are color, but will seem outdated at first.
After all, it's all about the blood.

5067	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game amazes me every time I play this cause it actually is one of the few games that I own that really tests the power of my Voodoo3 3D card, and I love it!  With 5 game plays (Last Man Standing, Capture the Flag, Assault, Domination, and Deathmatch)  this title will always be in your cd-rom drive.  The best thing about this game is the multiplayer capabilities and the fact that there are 1,000s of maps to download that will make Unreal Tournament fresh as the last time you played it.  It also has mods that you can install onto your system which are very kool such as Strike Force, and many others that I will not go into.  And if it doesn't sound like it can get much better there are also mods that add "skins" to your game (character skin) so you can look super fly for your murdering spree.  If you like games like this deffinately check out Half-Life, Quake 3 and Deus Ex.

The camera is a little annoying but you can always change the camera views with the C buttons.


Ocarina of Time tells the continuing story of the Zelda universe. In the Zelda timeline it takes place before the other games. As usual you are the hero Link. You must save the princess Zelda. You have different quests you must finish and many obstacles that will block your way. The story is that Ganondorf the evil wizard is trying to take over the world. Equipped with the Ocarina of Time you will travel time in your quest to save Zelda, Hyrule, and the world.
  To summarize: The campaign is more than enough to justify buying this incredible game, especially at its current price tag ... , and the online gaming rooms makes it worth twice the price.  Currently, Mechwarrior three is only played on two gaming services that I know of, Gamespy, and the more popular MSN gaming zone. -And to further compliment the online experience, there are maps, called 'icemaps', which reduce your weapons heat to nearly nothing, readily available from different websites. They add a very fun aspect of insane destruction to you gameplay, helping you to obliterate your enemies in a few well placed shots.

So, the next time some gaming industry MBA (who probably could not tell an RTS from an cRPG) tables the idea of LIMITED INSTALLATIONS, what he will have primarily accomplished is to have his game forgotten within a year.

6798	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game is more of a one-on-one fighter (a' la Mortal Kombat) than a wrestler, but both styles are incorporated into a good fighting game. Get this game instead of the SNES version (the Genesis version has 8 characters, but the SNES has only SIX!).
If you're a stickler for graphics, this is not your game.  True, there are patches for the computer version that makes the graphics of the characters a bit more bearable, but half the charm is the ludicrously sharp angles and style that was just pulling out of 16-bit gaming.  The cut scenes, for its time, were remarkable and had blown our young minds away all those years ago.  Now, however, it pales in comparison to what is being put out on next gen software.  Still, if you can look past the blocky animation the game will still blow your mind.
The main "arcade" experience can be brutally hard, as it would be in the wishes of any Street Fighter fan. The two-player experience is also extremely fun, as players new to the Alpha series can choose different fighting modes, one of which (X-ism) is more aligned with classic SF2 balancing. Other modes include A-ism, the Alpha standard, and V-ism, a mode that enhances a player's ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damage.

At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game, I turned on the game and found all my data was erased. At first I was angry, but then kind of relieved that I didn't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore. That's saying a lot, because I always finish games I start. (I turned the game on-and-off again, and the data was there again, so I did finish playing it. But the point still stands: I WANTED my data to be erased.)

This game is really big too; you can fly, turn invisible and go through certain types of walls, and turn into metal! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64. If you don't have a N64, you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks.

ONLINE!!!...5/5...
Music -  The music was done by Yoko Shimomura a female music composer for video games who has quite the amazing history of video games soundtracks including, Street Fighter 2, Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and more.
The graphics are classic 2-D, which might turn off some gamers hoping for something more like Castlevania 64 (which was fully-rendered 3-D). Despite the 2-D, the control and character movement is greatly enhanced thanks to better animation and smooth controls. Castlevania games always had great music, and SOTN is among the best in that department. Each score perfectly matches the given environment, with beautifuly orchestrated melodies. Don't let the old-school look discourage you, this is an amazing game.
There are puzzles as well, none that I can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a path.
The graphics are REALLY good.  Seriously.  Considering this is a Game Boy game, the only flaw is actually one that makes me feel like I'm nagging when I mention it- the graphics are in black and white.  That's basically the only difference compared to the Donkey Kong Country version.  Oh, and the music is actually a lot more melodic and creative too.  I love just about every single theme song.  Most Game Boy games have boring music- not this one.

They just can't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then. I wish they did, but they can't! It was just too well done! lol
This however makes Mythologies so unique. The storyline is set BEFORE the first MK game, so it could go in whatever direction it wished...and its all about SUB-ZERO.

6451	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	AOE2 is simply amazing...I've never played AOE1 so I can't make any comparisons, but look--AOE2 beats out much of the great RTS games (including my favorite game Starcraft) by including 13 civilizations with  infantry, cavalry, archery, naval units, siege weapons... and all kinds of  defense measures, including all-mighty castles and bombard towers.  The  diversity of units might be less than some widely popular games, but you  can understand and feel every single part of this game.  Upgrades from  Cavaliers to Paladins and Archers to Crossbowmen make sense--they aren't  just words from nowhere.  And if you're looking for a great campaign game,  this is it--there are carefully made videos and sounds (just as starcraft)  for the campaigns, and I especially enjoy the diversity of these one player  missions.  The 1st Mongolian mission was very interesting, requiring you to  befriend the different  tribes by bringing them sheep, killing the wolf  pack, founding the sacred relic, etc.  I also liked how this game handled  commerce.  There are a variety of types of resources (gold, stone, food,  and wood to be precise) and you can build trading carts to earn gold by  trading with other players, pay tribute, etc. etc.  This game is simply a  must-buy...it's worth every penny.

The PlayStation 2 is another machine to consider, IMHO the PS2's current crop of games do not justify it's heavy price tag, also if you have a DVD player on your TV, you are wasting money buying the PS2's DVD player (since the DVD has proven to be a failure for software delivery). The DreamCast has a very powerful graphics processor, it's inexpensive and it's quality control department works overtime to make sure only quality games are released. The PS2 will eventually beat it out, there are games like "Metal Gear Solid 2", but that's not relivant when you consider that PlayStation will always be at a disadvantage when it comes to great arcade style games. Sure they have Namco and Williams, but so does Sega (see dremacaast versions of Soul Calibur and Ready 2 Rumble), and Sega has their own brand that makes some really incredible games that are unbeatable in fun, but untill PS2 catches up DreamCast should be your #1 pick.

6128	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	When this thing was new it was certainly all the rage, but its main rival, the Sony Playstation was still a step ahead no matter Nintendo did.  Nintendo releases games like Goldeneye and Starfox, two GREAT games, but then Square and Sony release Final Fantasy VII to america, which certainly changed things.  On specifics, the N64 is 5 times more powerful than the playstation.  But the N64 cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black CDs.  Why Nintendo didn't bother to use CDs as they originally planned confuses many to this date.  CDs last longer, and in truth, are harder to damage.  A bad drop on a tile floor may send fragments of plastic and silicon from your "F-Zero X" could be all over the kitchen floor.  Nintendo did have one thing going for it over Playstation, remakes of classic games.  With the 8bit Nintendo, they started some great games out.  Then with the 16bit Super Nintendo, they made 16bit counterparts to the 8bit games.  Now with this 64bit system, they made counterparts to the 16 bit games.  This was their edge, and it made the system sell very well.  In the long run was this systems downfall.  Games are much harder to produce for N64 than they are playstation.  Even though it it more powerful than the playstation, it is still second to it.  What will happen soon, is anyone guess.  Nintendo next year will release their new Gamecube.  Gamecube doesn't play DVDs like Sony's Playstation 2, and it doesn't appear so far to be anymore powerful.  Playstation 2 will be hard to beat for one, as you can see by it's current demand.  It seems that Nintendo has become the underdog, with giants such as Microsoft entering the race.  Perhaps they'll pull through, its unknown.  Sega's Dreamcast is certainly on it's way down, it will not be possible to compete with the much more powerful Playstation 2 and Microsoft's X-Box, and possibly the morepowerful gamecube.  Word to the wise, if you're planning to buy a top of the line system, I do not currently suggest this system.  Dreamcast is a good bet for the buck, but waiting a while seems to be a wiser choice.

7327	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Perhaps Megaman 8 should have been called Megaman Playstation instead.  It feels more like a new version of Megaman than a true sequel to the other 8/16 bit Megamans. The graphics seem a little bland in spots, but for the most part it is a solid game. A few of the bosses seem corny, but after so many Megaman games there's only so much to work with.  The gameplay is right on (even though the game can be hard in spots) with all of Megaman's moves every gamer has come to know.  I think it's safe to say that even though it could have been better, Megaman fans will not be sorely disappointed with Megaman 8.
Anyway, I believe that the best feature of the game is THE  MULTIPLAYER OPTION. This is absolutey pure fun! The game is incredibly more  interesting once you are playing against real humans on the web. The  multiplayer version actually SEEMS A COMPUTER PAINTBALL GAME. Having played  paintball for a few years I guarantee you that by playing this game you get  most of the experience of paintball! You soon end up playing hours after  hours of totally different games, finding players of different skill  levels.
The story is great and uniqe and has
Along comes the Sony PlayStation.  For some, this marks the end of the Golden Age of classic video games.  I don't entirely agree, as that system was the home of a handful classics; Castlevania: Symphony of the Night revitalized the Castlevania series and outranked many of the 3-D games that cropped up at the time.  Metal Gear Solid redefined stealth action and brought Solid Snake into the mainstream.  Mega Man X4 continued the saga of Mega Man X and combined the old-school flavor of Mega Man with arcade-style, frenetic action.

 Good length for a game
4625	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I would have given this game 5 stars were it not so blatantly hateful of Republicans.

Please don't discuss processor speeds unless you truly understand how the chips are made. You can't compare systems based on the processor's MHz rating alone. CISC processors (like the Pentium series) handle one instruction at a time. RISC processors (like the PowerPC) have the ability to process multiple instructions at once. A slower RISC chip could process information faster than a CISC chip. You also shouldn't compare different chips. A standard Pentium 266 (mainly on laptops only) was not faster than a Pentium II 233. A 386/33 (33 being the speed) was not equal to a 486/33.
 First of all, a lot of the weopons in this game i don't like. There is only one machine gun ...only one shotgun ..one pistol , etc.  Cmon, wheres the variety??
But how about talking about the games? The games are the same as Red and Blue. Sharing the same Character's,music,plot,trainers,and towns. Want to know why it's called Red and Green? Red is the boy you play as. He is aiming to catch 'em all and become a pokemon master. He has a rival called Green who wanted to train pokemon to the limit. The two main characters are Red and Green,so the games were  named after them. Pocket Monsters Yellow came out to be like the Anime,was became a success. It featured Pikachu as the games mascot,he has his own voice,you can get all three starters,and has better graphics. Thanks to the popularity,Pocket Monsters Stadium came out the same year. It came of for the Nintendo 64,and it had only 43? Pokemon. It wasn't big,so in 1999,Pocket Monsters Stadium2 came out to have all 150 pokemon. Pokemon Stadium,which was made in 2000 in America is Japan's Stadium 2. Stadium in America has all the pokemon expect for Mew and Mewtwo. In 2000,Pocket Monsters Stadium:Gold and Silver came out,having all new pokemon. In America,that was Stadium 2. Pocket Monsters Trading Card Video Game was made,having fans play pokemon Cards on the go. This was released in 1999 for the Nintendo GameBoy Color. Pocket Monsters Snap came out in 1999,having the player take pics of pokemon in 3D. Pocket Monsters TCG came out in 1998,and was huge. There were tons of Cards to collect,and trade,which made them so popular. In fact,the Holographic Chazarid is really the one that was popular. It was so rare,so not many fans could find them in packs.

Microsoft Gaming Zone is getting really great too so you don't have to  worry about it being to complex. You will become hooked and be a quick Real  time strategy fan. This one is an Up-All-Nighter for you gamers. If you are  into RTS or no... get this game.
Some in-game jokes might be overlooked by casual X-Files fans, but if you were a regular watcher (or you've discovered the show on Netflix), you'll notice references to episodes like "Syzygy", "Blood Money", and "Piper Maru", among several others. One of the series writers, Frank Spotnitz, helped to write the game's screenplay, and I feel it could have worked as a two-part season 3 episode...the story is very good.

If you like quality puzzle-focused games that have straight-forward challenges (the game doesn't scale or do anything cheap to mess with you - try to "make the game more challenging"), and enjoy a good storyline (with great humor that doesn't take away from the game), you really should check out Abe in Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus (and Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee if you haven't already).  It is a really great game that is nothing but quality.  This is definitely one of those rare games worth owning and replaying.
Likened by many to Diablo, this game is superior in that it actually has a reasonably compelling storyline (though badly voice acted) and the combat system is not your average hack'n'slash - you learn new battle techniques from the master as you advance.  The use of a game pad is strongly recommended, though I survived all the combat encounters by pounding the hell out of my keyboard while moving about with the mouse.  The scenery is beautifully rendered (the lighting is a real feature), and animation of Locke and his enemies is superb, though a tad repetitious - like the giant spiders getting stuck on the sword and having to be removed with obvious difficulty (hilarious the first time), the death gurgles of the ninja guys got old very quickly.
The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.
All in all, this game is worth it. If you are looking for some challenging, retro gaming action this is a must-have for your collection.
I can verify that it works on Windows at least up to Win 7 64bit. I have not tried it on Win 8.
Truly, a game this strange could only come out of Japan. As with the first game Parappa, everything is paper cut-outs, the songs are all about performing a task (making a guitar with a chainsaw, landing a plane, putting out a fire, ect), but they are all great in their wacky way. There is also tremendous variety in the types of songs, which range from the now classic Master Onion Chop to the split-personality thrash rock of the plane song. Of course it's all feel good stuff culminating in a super-feel-good climax of the band playing their big gig.
My advice: play  selectively. You need to get into the mood. While i say that, it's without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this game.
9758	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is the best game EVER. Get it or be square
The PROS: For starters, there is a lot to do here. Not only do you race around in carts but after you accept challenges from the Genie (the character you interact with the most), beat them and you unlock the ability to race around in a hovercraft and a plane. There are a lot of stages to complete and not only can you unlock two additional racers, meet a certain condition and you unlock a secret area with its own stages to race on. The game looks great considering it came out in 1997. The overall presentation, graphics, music and sound effects fit the overall happy mood of the game. Three of your friends can take you in the multi player mode and you can use kart, hovercraft or plane here as well. So yeah, it will keep you busy and it's fun but it depends on who plays it because....

The Downs: Not  quite as pretty to look at, even with a super-dee-duper video card, as I  expected.

  Yep, the sound is also amazing. Perhaps even better than the graphics. I can still remember the sound at particular parts of the game even though I haven't played it in over a year. The boss music will really stick with you, so will the tadpole pond music. But those are just a few of the places that are memorable. I really think the sound is what did it for me with this game, it just hits you in that classic way. Much like how Zelda: Link To The Past is, or Final Fantasy 3.

6598	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This was an ok game (or should i say, games), but I didn't find it nearly as addictive as the other final fantasies i've played.  FFV was an ok addition to the series but the dialogue is awkward (They didn't do a fantastic job translating on V or VI) and the gameplay is more like a standard RPG than the final fantasy style.  Buy it if you're really into the FF series, but if you're just starting out, get FFVII first.
Gameplay-This is a first person point-and-click adventure.  Your cursor is a hand, and if you click to the right you can turn right or sometimes clicking to the right turns you around.  Same with the left.  The puzzles in this game were rather hard, but I found that most of them were solvable.  Whenever you get stuck, however, there is a hint system that gives you hints that can increase in magnitude until they just give you the answer.  For instance, asking for a hint just gives you a tiny hint that doesn't necessarily tell you what to do, but it points you in the right direction.  Then, if you are still stuck, you can get a stronger hint which tells you basically where to go and look.  And so on.  I used the hint system several times, and I would have been quite stuck without it.  I thought that this gameplay was easy enough to understand.

You play as Squall Leonhart, who is part of an elite military faction known as SeeD. SeeD members work for those who they are contracted to in order to collect funds. Squall is attempting to pass his SeeD exam with careful guidance from his instructor Quistis Trepe. He meets several other students along the way, some of which are Zell Dincht (a lively martial artist) and Selphie Tilmitt (a cheerful nunchaku-wielding girl). Squall's ultimate rival, Seifer Almasy, accompanies them on the exam as well.  After passing, Squall is assigned to work with a rebel group whose leader is Rinoa Heartilly, a beautiful and bright young woman. What starts as an average mission turns into a complicated and tangled web of love and deceit as Squall begins to question his values and the values of SeeD.
And leveling up is certainly what a Final Fantasy game is about.  Various side quests and challenges are provided so that reaching the levels needed to kill the final bosses doesn't become tedious, and an incredibly complex character building system makes sure that everyone's playing experience is different.

Beautiful graphics for its time.
You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart!
5082	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Released at the same time as the similar 'Quake 3', everybody was expecting this to be terrible. The original 'Unreal' was very nice to look at, but not much fun to play, and 'Tournament' seemed to be a rush-released  attempt at stealing some of 'Quake 3's multiplayer-only thunder.  Surprisingly, it's none of those things - it looks wonderful, and has some  nice music, but best of all it's extremely good fun to play. Even if you  don't play against real people (something I can't do, as it's impractical  in the UK), the single-player mode is worth the price of the game alone.  The AI, although still recognisably artificial, is balanced superbly - your  AI team-mates are good enough to fight for themselves, whilst your  opponents use varied strategies and aren't flawlessly perfect. The more  advanced bots are inhumanly good, but still mortal, which is a nice  touch.
Twin Snakes: If you liked the gameplay in MGS 2 better than the first game then i would highly reccomend this MGS 1 remake playable on gamecube and backwards compatible wii's(white wii's). The story on this one is slightly expanded and has MGS 2 gameplay mechanics and graphics so a real treat if you wanted another game like MGS 2.

Super Mario 64
lunar didn't have as much in that department but it kept the camera closer on fewer individuals in a way that drew me closer to these characters. as far as gameplay there isn't a whole lot in terms of customization. and there isn't a lot of grinding. something is always keeping you busy and moving to the next area. the battles in lunar are still fun although simple. in a way i feel that what ff3 did with gameplay and customization, lunar did with storytelling. the fmv sequences and higher quality sound in the cd format made it really stand out back then (at that time the sega cd video sequences were jaw-dropping good...ha). while ff3 stands as a kind of intellectual evolution of the rpg in the early 90s, lunar stands as an emotional one. in this psx remake the sega cd animations and much of the sound is replaced. also there aren't random battles in this version and the spells are labelled beyond just a picture so you always know what is what. if you're on the fence but really enjoy rpgs from this era then go for it. the price is steep so look for a used copy in good condition if you can. it's a short game but the quality is top notch.
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker: Gameplay very similiar to MGS 3 but with the concept of Mother Base added this is a base that you must find personnel for and is used to develop weapons and other various tasks which you must manage in between missions. Easily one of the best games in the series personally i enjoyed it more than 3.
The controls were easy to use...learn in about, what...4 minutes.
Gameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games. You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same, just different. The game is fun and a great challenge. Overall, these games are classical N64 greats!

The levels are split very well, and some can  be more fun then others. Some will seem like a tedious chore when playing  although the majority of others are a blast!
The reasons are numerous - graphics, gameplay, replayability and of course it's strategy element. The game is a lovely mix of complexity (the business model) and simplicity (setting up stations and laying track). It is real time strategy and economic simulator; as a virtual train set it's playful and yet with all stock market options turned on, it's as cuthroat as the world of the historic robber-barons must have been. The red in the game is not from bloody combat but simply your company bleeding to death as these tycoons (your computer adversaries) take you to the economic woodshed, short-selling your stock if they see an opportunity in ruining you in doing so. From all this it's obvious that economic factors are important, but how does this work in gameplay?

Don't listen to those who find this game too "difficult" due to the lack of gun.  All you require is a controller, some skill, and quick reflexes.
People criticize Dino Crisis 2 for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns, but the honest truth is, the original is a MUCH easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way. You can't do that in the second game. You have to stand up to them and shoot. So Dino Crisis 2 is a harder game, in my opinion. Oh sure, you are given an option to up the difficulty (in both Dino Crisis games) but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up SIGNIFICANTLY, making the game nearly impossible.
Explosions have an important role in Hollywood because it sells like hotcakes. Terminator 2, Die Hard, Speed, etc. and the list goes on: it just wouldn't be the same. The exact rule applies for video games, and sometimes a cool explosion can make you feel super cool, saying "holy crap, I did that!"

There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, "The God Room" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played.
Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.

1484	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	This is a futuristic dirt bike game, where rather than riding dirt bikes, you ride a jet-powered motorcycle. The game starts out being fun racing along exotic 3D courses like a jungle island, an earthquake rattled Los Angeles that has fallen into the sea, a cold mountain passageway and so on. When the player advances past the first few races the game stops being fun and starts getting unnecessarily and frustratingly difficult, because rather than having track borders (like walls) where the racer cannot go past a certain point, the courses further in the game take away those walls so you literally fall off the track. It is also unclear where the finish line is, sometimes you must do a lap around a circular track, and other times you must do a U turn then go back through the track. Then reappear on the track, far behind the other racers. The game is full of jumps, ridiculously high jumps, and while you are in the air you can do flips and tricks. Not any advanced tricks like from Tony Hawk. There are several racers, however the racers are so uneven that you can pick a certain racer and win constantly.

Bottom line, RE3:Nemesis is a good game. It's fun, scary, and entertaining. And no its not the best, and in my opinion its the weakest game in the series. And anyone who disagrees, obviously hasn't played the first two. But I will cut it some slack because Resident evil 3 had a lot to live up to. And it was because Resident Evil 2 really set a high standard for the series. Lets face it, Resident Evil 2 was a legendary game, and quite possibly the greatest sequel to any video game in history. I just think that RE3 could of been a better sequel. And it isn't as good as its predecessor.

Twisted Metal 4 has a great gameplay, exquisite graphics (for Playstation), and unique characters each with their own story and unique capabilities. In my opinion, Twisted Metal 4 is a one of a kind game that did the best of its saga (before Twisted Metal Black) to give background to its characters and really allow you to immerse yourself in the game. Great game to play with a friend. Would highly recommend.
This is not a "run-and-gun, all firefight" game.  Yes, there is no shortage of combat... but you need to think, to pause, and to observe, in order to succeed.

5559	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I used to love playing Quake 2. I played it for hours on end. When I heard about it's impending release in 1997, I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out. And what did I do when it did? I played it AT LEAST 3 to 4 days a week from 1997 to early 2002. And guess what? I became freakin sick of it! I do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth!! (Well, at least for 10 years or so) My point is, after you log hours and hours of gameplay, it starts to get old. FAST. Quake 2 may be a legendary game but I warn you don't overindulge. Play Max Payne, Deus Ex or Unreal Tournament 2003 instead.
I imagine there are lots of people out there with short attention spans who would get bored with Final Fantasy Tactics, so it can't have universal appeal, but anybody with a stitch of patience will get sucked into this game big time. It never seems like a waste of time and is fun and amazing on so many different levels that I could never go into enough detail to give it justice. But I can say that this game has stayed at the top of my list of best games of all time through the last three generations of consoles, and there have been some great games since then, and that's pretty impressive.

The villians get  smarter and tougher as you progress through the game, the 1st opponents are  just some slow moving, shotgun toting targets, later levels have half  ram-half man beasts that are almost invincible shooting rockets at you!  Good thing you can get a double barrel shotgun, a minigun anti aircraft  type weapon, brass knuckles, a rocket launcher, a plasma gun, a pistol and  even a chainsaw for those up and close encounters.

1481	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Now if you are a fan or those 2-D games and stuff like that, you probably will think this is a disgrace for the N64. I thought this game was awesome. Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.
Get this game for specific reasons.  It is one of PSX first games, also it features easy enough controsl and fun factor that can not be beat by most 3D fighters.
3)Even the A.I. in this game is a  challenge to beat on its hardest level, and the easiet levels let beginner  players get a chance to get the feel of the game and learn the civilization  attributes before taking on other human players.
what i don't like in the game is the rabbit they should give me a rifle or a shotgun

I was quite impressed with the quality of the books. Hard covered, gilded edge pages, good binding.
For those gamers who, like me, need to like a character in order to fully appreciate the game's plot, let me say this: Squall is a moody, horrible, angst-ridden Phallocrat. His supporting cast are forgettable, with the exceptions of the consummately annoying Zell Dincht and the ridiculously feeble Rinoa Heartilly. The characters in FF 8 have none of the appeal of Cloud et al from FF 7, or Zidane and the lovable half-breeds from FF 9.

While this game is good, if you got a psp or a ps3 you can download the game from the PSN. But thats only if you don't really care about having a physical copy.
- The save system is better, and worse, considering that unless you accidently, or purposefully, write-protect your save file, you are almost guaranteed not to lose progress. However, you don't come back in the same spot, and if you left items laying on the ground, you won't find them again.
not air combat. It popped up and I did not bother to read the few letter difference.
Cons:
London:
Music (score 10/10): Wow.  When I first heard the opening song (Liberi Fatali), I was blown away.  The rest of the game's music doesn't dissapoint either.  Be it exciting songs or mellow tunes, FF8 delivers.  I actually went and bought the soundtrack, which I still listen to, to this day.
All in all a good controller that can be used in all sorts of  games - but of course it is best in games which are enabled to use the  shockfunction
I can't really point out any major flaws... I wish the game had better voice acting, or none at all. Apart from that, the only thing I want from Grandia, is a remake. Modern graphics, gameplay, technology, would make Grandia one hell of an adventure for those who missed out on it the first time around.

When you then get close to the "lordess" metroid -so fine- you have to fight i think 9 new metroids! which is a add on the prevoious 39 so technically theres 48 (49 if you include the queen) anyways then you anilate the lordess and for some reason on my game theres this weird red line on the wall but whatever it goes donw after teh battle and for some ohter reason theres a little excape hole under the lordess. so i guess you can wimp out and excape kinda ruins the point of a boss if you can jsut "escape"?! but oh well after you defeat IT. then a baby metroid hatches (jimminy crickets where do all these things come from!!!! fun never ends with metroid 2 ;) but then you escape the terrifing planet and go to your ship.

A day later, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Dr. Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, depleting the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and flooding and destroying Station Square. Tikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos's heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Sonic's friends cheer him on, and Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following Chaos' defeat, Sonic discovers that the Chao he once was guardian of now live in Station Square, so he leaves them on Earth to live there. United with Tikal, Chaos peacefully departs to the past. The game ends with Sonic chasing after the fleeing Dr. Eggman.

Probably the biggest challenge comes in the way of puzzle-solving.  Now, think back to Resident Evil 2.  What did you have?  You had three or four puzzles to solve.  And they were EASY!  In Nemesis, let's see, you have 10-12 puzzles to solve, and some of them simply can't be completed unless you're either a really excellent puzzle solver, or you look the answers up on the internet.
The game is just tedious. It's boring and insipid and hackneyed to death. I'm sure there will be many who say, "Grandia rulez! you lie!" and give me a "not helpful" vote. I didn't write this to please anybody...I wrote it because I think Grandia does not deserve the praise it receives. Heed my word, and perhaps you will save 50 hours of you life.

I could go on and on... this is a game that has a simple premise... but manages too weave in so many complex elements, all fun, yet never loses the simplicity.  Games were meant too be simple.  a fun distraction from the hectic pace of life. The video gaming industry has grown into such a massive beast over the past few years.  It's no longer a niche hobby.  and such there is a high financial demand for innovation.  But sometimes innovation comes at the cost of fun.  Castlevania SOTN manages too retain the simplicity of the old days.... while having innovations up the kazoo.  That's why so many people have scuh strong feelings for it today.  I would reccommend this too anyone that likes videogames, or wants too start playing them.

6332	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	The N64 was Nintendo's 3rd console (not counting the Game Boy, and Virtaul Boy).It came out shortly after the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation. If you don't have this system anymore or never have. And collect systems and and games, then I recommend this system. The controller has always at first glace seemed like a gimmick. And like myself, probably made you think how are people supposed to use that controller. But it actually isn't too bad! The system it's self is pretty simple, yet cool looking. And is for the most part really reliable. And having 4 controller ports is a plus too! Though it would have been nice if Nintendo released more mature games for the console, there are some classic games. I recommend the games below.
This sim includes all of the previous IL-2s made by Ubisoft before 2006, so any other ones like IL-2 Forgotten Battles and Pacific Fighters are not necessary. IL-2 1946 includes most of WWII on the Western front, the Pacific front, but focuses on the Eastern Russian front. The 1946 portion focuses on an alternate timeline in which all the major leaders like Roosevelt, Stalin, and Hitler have died and the new leaders send their countries into vastly different paths than those of reality. The war continues into 1946 where both Allies and Axis have advanced rocket and jet aircraft. Some U.S.S.R. aircraft are even as advanced as the MiG-15, some even more. German late-war prototype aircraft like the Go-229 have materialized and are used in combat. Even guided missile technology is available. I have to admit, that at first, I was a bit skeptical since IL-2 1946 was designed in Russia. It turns out that as I suspected, IL-2 is significantly embellished towards the U.S.S.R., (I wonder why?) with more Russian aircraft than U.S., British, and French aircraft combined. But when I realized what else IL-2 had to offer, I knew this was the best combat flight sim of all time. IL-2 includes over 400 different aircraft from the USSR, US, Britain, France, Germany, Norway, Finland, Romania, Slovakia, Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, and more! At least 250 of these are flyable, including: The A-20, B-25, P-38, P-39, P-40, P-47, P-51, P-63, YP-80, F2A Buffalo, SBD Dauntless, F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat, F4F Corsair, Hurricane, Spitfire, Tempest, Beoufighter, Mosquito, I-153, I-16, Mig-3, Yak-3, Pe-2, and so many more that it would take a whole page to fit them. Many non-flyable never-before-modeled aircraft are present also, like the massive Me-323 6-engined transport, Ju-88 Mistel flying bomb, Fw-200 Condor, and many more. There are hundreds of different meticulously detailed tanks, vehicles, and warships. One of my favorite things about IL-2 is that the Pacific front of the war is included, along with US Navy and Japanese carrier borne aircraft, a great selection of Japanese land-based planes, the B-29, (non-flyable. Boo hoo.) submarines, torpedo boats, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, and many aircraft carriers. The mission builder is great, with 3D maps, condition settings, and infinite waypoint combinations. Tanks and other vehicles stick to roads when possible, but will go almost anywhere you program them to. The world is divided into separate smaller maps, which you can select. Many fronts are present, like Normandy, The Ardennes, Berlin, Gulf of Finland, Manchuria, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Midway, Hawaii, Moscow, and many more Russian maps. You can program waypoints for aircraft, tanks, and ships, and set the speed, altitude, direction, skill, paint job, gun accuracy, firing rate, and more. The missions are good, but you will find that you will enjoy making your own missions much more. The aircraft, vehicle, ship, building, sky, ocean, and terrain graphics are all unparalleled by any other sim, with outstanding detail from huge forests of 3D trees and rocky mountains, to super detailed buildings and tanks with words even visible on the sides! You can even see personnel at their positions on ships! The AI for everything is incredible, enemy aircraft know advanced maneuvers, tanks aim their turrets and fire at enemies, and ship turrets and flak guns fire accurately at targets. However, IL-2s user interface is lousy. The menu is boring and has tiny buttons for everything, but this is nothing compared to the quick and full mission builders. For over 350 aircraft, and a few thousand other vehicles, buildings, and objects, there are tiny drop down lists which you must scroll through to select anything. The scroll bar is 3/16ths of an inch wide, (I kid you not!) and is so short that it takes about 30 seconds to get your curser centered over it. When zoomed in to a map, it switches to 3D mode for the entire terrain, so this will slow down your computer and curser significantly unless you have a high-end graphics card. Between this and the scroll bars of death, it is almost impossible to do anything on the mission builder without a good mouse. My cousin owns IL-2, and he can hardly move his curser at all on the mission builder. The frame rate in flight is about  to 2 frames per second, (F.P.S.) which is horrible. Target F.P.S. is usually about 20 F.P.S.. This is probably because his graphics card is outdated. However, I have a very old IBM ThinkPad laptop with Windows XP, and IL-2 works just fine on it. If possible though, you want a high-end graphics card, and a large screen. The intro music is pretty cool, but when you hear the main menu music, you will burst out laughing. It sounds like circus music, or something from a corny cartoon. But, amazingly, IL-2 gives you the ability to change system files, unlike most other sims, so you can switch the circus music with something less annoying. There is also the issue of swearing. The box says it includes mild swearing, but I would debate that. At some points, it seems like all the pilots ever say is the same swearword over and over, which is not realistic anyways since Japanese, German, Russian, and French pilots wouldnt speak English. But, luckily, again you can change this in a notepad system file called conf.ini, by changing the noswearing: value from 0 to 1, and save. I really appreciate the ability to change system files on this sim, you can fix many of the annoying problems once and for all. All in all, this is the BEST combat flight sim my friends or I have ever seen, defiantly a must-have for WWII airplane buffs. Since IL-2 1946, Ubisoft has come out with more combat flight sims, I have not bought any of these yet, though.

6380	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Okay. Some people (Like 10 and 12 year olds) think this game is sooo cool. This game so very unrealitic. Infact, everything about this game is stupid. The weapons are okay, but when you fire, there is no recoil that makes you reticule (The cross thingy that helps you aim) go up and down. Also, 1 shot from any gun kills an enemy (Which is pathetic) so why put your M4A1 rifle on burst? Just use single shot to conserve ammo. The games graffics are as [bad] and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony. I suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above. Please, save your money and buy a better game like Counter-Strike (The best game ever made) Half-Life (The second best) or Rainbow Six: Raven Shield (The third best) If you are looking for realism, DO NOT look here at this game. Its pathetic.

8853	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	With the success of Kirby's Dream Land, Nintendo went to crank out a sequel to the million selling title. In 1995, Kirby's Dream Land 2 was released and it too was a smash success. Essentially a bigger and better game, Kirby's sequel pleased all Game Boy owners who bought the game. It's still just as cute and fun and was a must own back then.
Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.


3507	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I bought this back in September of 1999 when it first came out. I was excited to play it. I couldn't believe how small it was compared to my other consoles, which I had the original PlayStation, Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. The first game I end up buying for it was Sonic Adventure. Which is a pretty awesome game, the graphics were amazing, bright and colorful. Later on I would end up buying games like Shenmue, Crazy Taxi and Jet Grind Radio. The Dreamcast was ahead of it's time, but it died too early. It has a great library of games, so I highly recommend it.

I still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game, though.  More often than not, an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area, like near a corner, behind a crate or somewhere you can't see.  It's really not a big deal, though.  Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across.  If you're still having trouble finding items, just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode, and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around.  This works really well.  In fact, the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami.

1726	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is where the Crash Bandicoot games got really, really good. Everything that the first game got wrong; the second game got it right. The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back; obviously reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $6 so Id recommend getting that version if you are interested. Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios, the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way. The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth. He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth. We also meet Crashs sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortexs true intentions. Meanwhile, Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortexs right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us, all with different intentions.
I heartily recommend this to any fan of simulation games in the  vein of Sim City, Theme Hospital, or The Sims.  This is a great game with a  high addiction factor.

4031	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Yes, Doom was the beginning of the FPS genre as we know it. But Half-Life marked the beginning of an evolutionary leap for the genre. Quite simply put, Half-Life is, and will remain, one of the greatest games ever. I really can't put the gameplay experience into words, but I remember when I first played this game almost ten years ago, I was absolutely absorbed. Seriously. Absorbed. At the time, the mods were sharp, fun, and novel. Counter-strike. Firearms. Team Fortress Classic.
1035	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When I had this game, I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game. It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode, which is not bad, but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although, that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games, too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh, I have the one on Gameboy Advance, which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now, that confused me.


Any criticisms I have with this game? Well its hard for me to think of things I don't like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you cant skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn't do that in the first game and its a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombies corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn't too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but Ive mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. Thats about all the criticisms I can think of.

Of course, shotguns and magnums are only available for the Leon quest. In Claire's quest, you have something called Acid Rounds and a Bow Gun, which are equally as dangerous. They do tremendous damage to enemies, which means it would be wise to save them until the end of the game.

A brand new series means a brand new story and it goes something like this:
The main addition to Director's Cut is an "arranged" version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion, as well as the enemy placement. The main characters, as well as Rebecca, are given a new wardrobe and the player's handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie, killing it instantly. The original version of the game is included as well, along with a new "beginner" mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled. Additionally, the auto-aim function was restored in all modes, though it is not noted in the in-game controls so the player must accidentally stumble upon it.

"Fallout 2" uses the same engine as the original, and was easy to  slip into, since the commands were all familiar, but because the initial  release is notoriously buggy, make sure you install the patch before you  start.  Set 80 years after the events in "Fallout", your character is a  descendent of the Vault Dweller who, with some refugees, had established a  village far to the north when expelled after saving Vault 13.  Over the  years, village life had become increasingly tribal and memories of Vault 13  had slipped into the murky realms of mystical memory.  Drought had set in,  crops failed, children and cattle were starving when a chance viewing of an  old holotape revealed the existence Vault 13's Garden of Eden Creation Kit  (G.E.C.K.) - just what was needed for a bountiful existence.  After  surviving a difficult test, your character, the Chosen One, is sent off,  with few skills and little equipment, to locate the Holy Vault 13 and  return with the G.E.C.K.  Of course, it is not quite as easy as that, as  you gradually find out the Master in "Fallout" was a pussycat compared to  your ultimate opponents.
One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two "final battles" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy. I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge. This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an "epilogue" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever. The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more.

Dino Crisis featured full 3D background, not prerendered ones like Resident Evil. It was much more advanced. You have a limited inventory but have different types of healing items and ammunition for each gun.
For your spells and abilities, it includes the Materia System. While I'm not gonna spoil what a materia is, the basic function of it is to give you special abilities. Equip it on your weapon or armor and you can cast magic, summon beasts, counterattack, steal or give you some benefits. Master it and it'll create a new one. So awesome materia like Ultima, Knights of the Round or Mime can be replicated, giving you almost an endless string of summons.
The only real problem I have with this game, is that the FMVs can't be skipped (there's only so many times you can watch the thing with the gondola ...) and that the last battle, especially if you've done the optional quests, is too easy.
If the battles as a whole seem too easy in this game, it is because the game was designed with the intention of challenging the player to experience it, rather than challenging the player to get through it. The game is filled with a variety of fun methods for winning battles, from high-powered summons to enemy skills, and some otherwise difficult boss battles become unloseable after equipping a specific accessory. Part of the coolness of this game is the fact that it was the first major RPG to allow the players to develop extremely poweful heroes, by combining abilities such as auto-resurrection, auto-haste, multiple counter attacks, mp absorbtion, and much more. In other words, the lack of challenge is largely deliberate, and designed to give the players freedom to choose which resources to throw at a particular battle, rather than forcing the players to throw everything they have at most battles in order to have a chance for victory. The inessential-but-fun nature of the sidegames, such as snowboarding and chocobo-breeding, mirrors the inessential-but-fun nature of the majority of the special abilities in this game which may be used during battle.

4280	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I heard that this game had garnered a good reputation, but until now it had never piqued my interest. There are so many games in the real-time strategy genre - you have classics like Age of Empires 2 and Command &  Conquer, or total stinkers like Tiberian Sun.
The BGM music is a-ok... not as memorable as that offered by, lets say, final fantasy or wild arms, but it's still pretty nice since it matches the game well enough. There are a few fast tunes that would stay in your head (well, for me anyway). As for the voices, they retained the japanese voices instead of handing it to amateurish dubbers of that era... GOOD MOVE! The japanese voices are awesome (although it may annoy some who doesn't have trained ears for words that don't sound english), with some famous seiyuu voicing out the character's battle voices. A definite treat for anime fans!
It's a very colorful game.  I think the colors help make the graphics look better.  I wouldn't say the graphics are bad, though.  I don't think Nintendo could have improved on the graphics because this IS an early 90's game after all, and Nintendo was in the beginning stages of finding out what the Super Nintendo could do.  Nintendo found out the Super NES could do much more and go much further than originally expected when Star Fox and Donkey Kong Country were created.
Though not having a fantastic run in Arcades, the game was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and launched with the system.  When it was released it was such a smashing success and offered so much for players that we had a new champion of fighters.  It was simple enough for newcomers but had enough depth for experts.  But more than that, 8 way run and the detail the game had was, at the time, just unheard of.  Looking at it now, it's hard to believe the game was originally made in 1998.  It was not only well ahead of its time, but the only game that really seemed to give it any competition was the release of Soul Calibur II years later.  Since it's release the original Soul Calibur has gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made.  And to this day, the only game that is really like Soul Calibur are the other Soul Calibur games.

  Basically, if you want one of the best RPGs ever, based on second edition DandD rules, buy this game. It's a bajillion times better than diablo and it's equally stupid sequal combined. Those games have almost no plot, they are a disappointment to all games, and should be destroyed for even calling themselves RPGs. The plot is awesome to Baldur's Gate, you can do whatever you want, complet a quest, don't complete one, it doesn't matter, but you pay the price. And hey, in what other game can you kill anyone you want, including hookers. And in what other game can you give dead cats to little girls? Huh? If you haven't played it, buy it for the whole 20 dollars they sell it for, and you'll see what i mean. When you beat it, their' an expansion, a sequel, an expansion for the sequel, icewind dale, an expansion for that, and the soon to be released icewind dale 2. All of these games you can import the same guy into.  Buy it!...

I remember liking the story line; finding out what happened to the lost expedition and saving the world from the comet. The game has different and distinct looks in the world from all types of towns and villages, to a castle, along with different terrains.  I liked gathering the information to advance in the game it wasn't so hard that you would get frustrated too much, like in Chrono Trigger I had to make lots of notes. Taking a breath and thinking about something would get you past the issue. For that matter, I do not remember the puzzles being too hard or leveling up being difficult. I do not remember much backtracking like in some games. If you have ever played Secret of Evermore, Final Fantasy III or Secret of Mana this game is along those lines. I don't think it is as large as the previously named games, but it is long enough to put a smile on your face.  I don't remember the exact hours I played this game, but I know it was over 40. I am glad I found and played this game.

In the end this is an absolutely enthralling story.  I logged a lot of hours playing this game and it easily kept me occupied for a few months.  I don't play games all day for long periods of time, rather I tend to play for a few hours each day, so it takes me a long time to complete epic games of this magnitude.  If you are a die-hard Planescape fan, like me, then this is absolutely a must buy and if you're also quite the connoisseur of RPG's, then this is definitely a game to look into.

9587	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	thats right you read that correctly 4 copies worn through 2 gave 1 away and wearing down number 4.  To be honest I was quite hesitant on even renting this game when it came out thinking that square was using the success of VII (ff VII) to rack in the sales of this less than average game.  Well I was wrong (not the first time either) so far I've played through the game 7 times and it becomes more involving each time as I try to create a different team (even ramza takes on different roles, this time I didn't even give him the chance to finish his base class and went right into mage).  The game is hard thats a no brainer and if you are a no brainer then don't pick up this game cause I don't know where copy 5 is comming from and I'd just assume not have to guess.  There will be frustration, there will be hardships, you will get mad at it and wonder how on Gods green earth did square manage to make such crap.  Then you can pick up the controller again and give that battle on riovanes castle roof top another try to keep Rafa alive (Very Hard 4/5 or 7/5 depends on what you want to achieve).  Not going to lie to you if you don't plan ahead then you will be dead before the battle has even started.  I wouldn't even try to compare this to the other games in the series but rather a game of unforgiving chess.  you have 5 or sometimes less characters and the opposing side can have as few as one (and a very hard one at that) or 10 that can be equally difficult.  Unlike the other games terrain makes a huge difference in this game (each landscape is unique and beautifully done) just because you are next to someone doesn't mean you'll hit them they could be standing 20ft above and neither can do anything.  another wonderful aspect is the story line full of reading, contemplating and scratching of the head.  somedays I would get a huge peice of puzzle just before bed and find myself lying for 20 min trying to figure out where it all fits and how this will affect the main character.  Some ppl may find the plot to be either too deep or too complicated, I felt right at home.  Even our own past is just as complicated and twisted and I would expect that of a game that is trying to relflect our own world.  You can keep your Sephiroth and his standard destroy the world scheme,  I'll take the shadowy plots of corruption, cloak and dagger and the dark truth of some of the most trusted ppl in the world that are just as manipulative and far more evil than that which they condemn.

While Turok 2: Seeds of Evil stood in the shadow of Rare's Goldeneye during it's release, Turok 2 still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every Nintendo fan should add to their collection. If not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with, then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a game.

I turned the game off after I was done in the school and couldn't sleep with the light off!!  I did eventually play through the whole game and beat it but I have never been so scared playing a video game in my entire life!!!  The really scary music and sound effects play a big part.  But what's really scary isn't just the atmosphere, the music or visuals.  It freaks me out thinking about why the town of Silent Hill is deserted and how Samael came along.  If I think about this stuff before I go to sleep, a lot of times, I can't sleep.  The Alternate Hospital, Alchemilla Hospital is another really scary place in the game that really scared me too but not as bad as the school.  To be honest, when I first was going through the Alternate school, the way it looked, that's what I thought hell would look like, it was so scary.  To this day, it scares me!  Sometimes even with the light on, it's scary!!  Even though the graphics aren't the best, this Silent Hill game scares me more than Silent Hill's 2, 3 or 4 and they have better graphics!!!  I would not recommend this game to anyone who scares easily!

Overall, if you've mastered the first two games and hunger for more, then by all means pick up RE3. It's not perfect, but any older fan will find this game worthwhile. However, NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH THE OTHER GAMES FIRST BEFORE TACKLING ON THIS ONE, AS THEY MAY FIND RE3 TO BE FRUSTRATING. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
2011	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Although there are video games out there that can wow you, and then there are the duds. Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel. In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version, it really seems to be alright, but looks are always decieving. In the case of Nintendo 64, there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel. This isn't really one of them.

4111	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a great game! The custom coasters are the thing that really gives this game its value. There are so many different options you can add to your park. Hours and hours of fun A must buy!
The resolution on the characters and the objects are high!
Regardless of difficulties, Myst is one of best games ever made especially for casual players. I rarely give five stars.
And, equally complimenting the humongous strides in the visual department is what I'd loudly proclaim to be the best soundtrack of the series. As was becoming the norm by this point, each character, vehicle, town and dungeon has its own accompanying theme song, but never before had the tunes been so closely intertwined and related as they are here. The softly plucked strings of the Balamb Garden, your base of operations for the majority of the game, are touched upon and mentioned throughout nearly the entire soundtrack, bringing the entire experience full-circle and tethering it to what's quickly identified by both story and player alike as your home. Even the overly sappy J-Pop love ballad, "Eyes on You," which is possibly one of the more annoying things I've ever heard on its own, fits in amazingly when surrounded by the rest of this impressive score. Nobuo Uematsu has never produced finer, nor more immediately recognizable and emotional work.

What also aids the visuals is that the animations were done by Pixar themselves. It uses the digitized style of animation found in the critically lauded Donkey Kong Country series, and Toy Story manages to look just as good, if not better, than any of the games in that series. The complimenting colors, the visual design lifted straight from the film, and the incredibly smooth animations, as well as tricks like smooth sprite scaling and rotation, make this an incredible looking game, for its time. Again, the only thing I believe that comes close to it visually is the Earthworm Jim series.
9256	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Max Payne is a must have for any serious gamer. The graphics and realism are all that anyone could ask for, however you must be sure that you have a system that can handle the kind of power needed to be able to enjoy this game to the fullest. If you don't, all you'll be able to see is choppy, slide by slide movie looking gameplay, which takes away from the game, and makes it so that it's virtually unplayable. The bullet-time mode is what really makes the game though. It slows down time so that you can kill multiple enemies in one room, while taking minor if any injuries to yourself. Once again, a must have for any serious gamer.
1372	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I didn't use to be into Mario or Kirby but now I like them both as much as I like the Legend of Zelda series I still have many more games to purchase based on those 2 characters.

9819	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When my cousin started talking about the Resident Evil series, I thought I should give them a try.  I got this one first, since the first one was all out.  I got home and put it in the Playstation.  I loved the beginning part, although I was confused not having the first one.  First off there are 2 discs for 2 different characters, Leon and Claire.  I found out later Claire is related to Chris from the first one.
First, the single player mode. While it has some interesting missions and some cool objectives, it's not really the heart of this game at all. About the only cool thing in the entire single player experience is the alien Elvis, who makes some funny, and weird noises when you talk to him.

Now to mention something positive- the graphics are *extraordinary* by the N64 standards.  Yes you will see occasional blockiness, but it's usually an uncommon occurrence.  The console takes full advantage of a beautifully presented 3D world with believable jungle features that recall the same kind of magic from the Donkey Kong Country days.  The music... that's a disappointing one however.  The game is probably going for atmosphere, but the actual notes are only catchy during specific moments (such as Diddy riding a jetpack- I enjoy the drumming and guitar there) and the heavier guitar parts in other areas.  Most of the time the soundtrack is forgettable.  At least it feels that way in the main areas while you venture around exploring (or in other words where you spend half of your time).  Occasionally some short-lived songs might perk your attention.
You get 128MB and you also get to use them, (PS2 slim is what I used). The memory card manager reads you have ~126,345KB free.

The Gameplay is fast paced, simple and fun. Action packed- there is never a dull moment.

For that person who's never played Quake before, the object of the game is to make it through the game alive while killing and eliminating as many enemies as you can. Players wage battle through 25 levels, acquiring keys to unlock doors to progress through the game. There are no objectives except to kill everything in sight and make it to the next level. If you've ever played the PC version of the game, you probably won't be shocked with the changes made with the Nintendo 64 port of the game. All the levels are there but some are modified specifically for this game. There's no new or exclusive levels to speak of, although I feel the game may have sold better had there been a few. Unlike Doom 64, multiplayer is there but nothing to write home about. The two-player deathmatches are fun though.
5442	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Whew!!!!!!!!!...After being highly disappointed with the N64 version and playing it on the PSX with my cousin, I think that the PSX version is the BEST MORTAL KOMBAT GAME EVER!!!! I mean, how can you go wrong with picking this excellent title up to build up on your PS1 collection? This has Fatalities, Stage Fatalities, Brutalities, Fatalities and many others. Plus, you can get the classic MK Characters and stages. So, if you do not have this game and have either or all of the three PlayStations that have came out, I highly recommend you to pick this masterpiece up.
The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, "Who is the most beautiful of them all?" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself?
557	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	pretty good game. especially for the price.

6850	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I first played this game at my cousins house.  I had played sonic 3 before, so I was eager to play sonic 2.  Man, they don't make video gmes like this anymore.  Simple, yet challenging, yet extremely fun.  I got the code for level select and super sonic shortly after I beat the game.  Go to options at the title menu, go to sound test, and put in 19,65,9,17.  You'll hear a sound. Then, press c.  The title menu will come on again.  Hold down A and press Start.  The level select will come up on the screen.  Go to the sound test at the bottom of the screen, and put in 4,1,2,6. You'll hear a sound, now you can be super sonic! Go to any level you want, get 50 rings and jump.
 An interesting feature in this game that was (unfortunately) not featured in any others is that you can affect other bosses' stages by defeating a certain boss. For example, you kill Chill Penguin, and the lava in Flame Mammoth's stage freezes. Stuff like that...it's really neat-o. The only thing that this game is lacking is plot. Sure, if you sit through the annoying sequence in the beginning with the type writer and the alarm noise, you see that X is a new kind of robot that can think and act for himself and that if he was to make a wrong decision the effects could be disastrous. You would also see that a man named Dr. Cain discovered X in a capsule 100 years after he was made. But after that, there wasn't much to the plot, except "Let's go find Sigma!" and "I'll take him, X!" and then "Crap, I'm dead!" and finally, "You've killed me, X, but we'll meet again!" The plot is the only minus in this game. Had this game had a better developed storyline, it would've gotten the full five stars. However, it's still a great game, and I would recommend it to anyone who was new to the series and interested in which game they should play first, and it's not expensive, so anyone can easily buy it without getting a hole in their wallet.
PROS:
I honestly believe, if you have an appetite for running around destroying zombies, that Nemesis is the *perfect* Resident Evil game for you.

Of course, you can also name it Winky-dinky-do, if it do please ya. But I digress.

4668	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a terrific game for children who love the Toy Story films.  All the regular characters make appearances and it's just too fun controlling Buzz Lightyear!  I only wish the graphics, sound and control were a bit more polished.  The dificulty comes mainly from a constantly moving camera (but you can fix it when needed) and a bit too loose control.  For the younger gamers though these drawbacks won't matter much as it's fun just wondering around the levels and finding your friends.  You get to explore Andy's house, Al's Toy Barn and an airport among others.  Older and more experienced gamers will probably want to pass on this due to the laskluster graphics and unsophicated gameplay.  But if you're a fan as much as I am then you'll be able to look past these drawbacks and enjoy the game.  One thing to keep in mind is that to save your game you need to have a controller pack.

2256	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	It works like the one for the N64.  It's a little bit bigger that you're not able to put the cover back on the N64.  I haven't tried it yet with Perfect Dark and any other games that require the expansion pack.  It's alright though.
The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too.

5540	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	One of those rare cases where a game developer doesn't compromise gameplay in favour of graphics.  Omega Boost gets the best of both worlds.  Though the 360-degree environment can make you dizzy, the addition of the "face forward" button drastically improves ease of controls.  And the backgrounds and characters look sharp but remain responsive, which makes for a great fast-paced shooter.
I've only done it once in my life and it's so frustrating that I never want to do it again.
2479	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is simply amazing, you can't disagree, it is so fun, never repetative because everyday I would invite friends over to my house and we would play for hours and hours. The gameplay is great, if your into Melee it is similar but it takes a while getting use to the controls of the Gamecube. I was a master at this game, I loves it so much, a character I recommend that all beginners should use would be Fox, he is the easiest to use, but he is also very good if you can use him right. Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners, but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game. This is a fantastic game, unlock characters, set new records for your vs matches because every match you have goes down into the record column. This is a must have for N64 whether you are 10 or 20! Remember though, play with friends, not by yourself!

The courses offered include somwhere around forty real racecourses from all around the world, accurately rendered and designed to scale. Everything from Laguna Seca, to Grindlewald, to Pikes Peak.
On the audio front, the sound effects are excellent.  Launching rockets, shattering neon signs, and, of course, explosions.  All well done.  The intentionally emotionless female voice that addresses you after each stage is very credible, and the German commands you hear during boss encounters lend a terrific sense of atmosphere to the game.  Moody and catchy techno tunes provide the musical backdrop and, for the most part, complement the corresponding areas perfectly.  The operatic female vocals at the beginning of stage one clash very effectively with the destruction that ensues and let you know your ears are in for a treat from the start.  And, the music for the sixth stage end boss (after the rocket with the time limit) is so rousing, you won't even care when he kills you 20 times in a row.
For nostalgia's sake, get this game, pop it in, disregard that it looks blocky on a new TV, and enjoy the memories!

This is not the average Mario game, but rather is it what fans would call a Yoshi game, since it plays a lot differently. As Yoshi, you romp through levels like usual, but now you can throw eggs at enemies, as well as eat enemies to make eggs. There is also a huge variety of obstacles, like boulders, loads of unique platforms, collectible flowers, the enemies doing all kinds of stuff, etc, etc. But the thing is: It is all well-crafted and carefully put together for one of the ultimate platforming experiences. Don't believe me? Go on some video websites and watch some gameplay footage. One look and you'll agree that it looks beyond terrific.
I was  impressed!


Golden eye and this game is almost the same because you get to use gun's so on. In this game you meet other people well, can't tell you, you got to play it yourdself.

What I didn't like about the story was that it was too confusing. Like, who is Nemesis?? Where did he come from?? I mean seriously whats his origin? Also, in RE2 Leon and Claire were looking for Chris, who we later discovered had traveled to Europe. But your telling me that Jill was in the city the whole time? And not once did Leon and Claire cross paths with her? Come on...
GAMEPLAY:  This is where some have complained about FF8.  Obviously the gameplay is different from FF7 and as you already know, Squaresoft dramatically changes the gameplay with each FF release.  Sometimes it's for the better as it is here and sometimes it just doesn't work (FF9).  Materia has been replaced by GFs or summons.  Each character relies on them for abilities and what not.  Stats are increased by leveling up and by junctioning magic to certain stats.  Magic must be drawn from enemies or various draw points.  MP has been eliminated and replaced by the draw system.  GF abilites are learned by attaining AP from enemies after battles.  The actual battles are almost the same as FF7 except limit breaks can be used only when a character is near death or when he or she uses an Aura spell, whereas in FF7 they were charged as the character takes damage.  The difficulty level of this game was too much for some gamers.  Enemies get stronger as your characters get stronger rather than certain areas containing different level enemies.  I personally loved the difficulty level.  FF7 became too easy around disc 3 and FF9 was WAY too easy throughout.  The sidequests were more challenging than the other titles as well.  This game was a great challenge for me and I loved it.  Another great addition to this game was the Triple Triad card game.  This was an incredible mini-game throughout the whole game.  Even after you've beaten everything, you can still have fun playing Triple Triad.  Squaresoft should make the next online FF title have an online version of this card game.  The only drawback to this game is the number of things you can do inside the cities.  The cities themselves are vast and much more detailed than FF7 but the problem is that there are few places you can actually go to in the cities.  On FF7 and FF9 you can go inside item shops, houses, and other various places.  Even the massive city of Esthar only has about 8 places you can actually go inside of.

5811	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	And I've been doing it ever since. My dad bought me this in the spring of 2000. To cut to the chase, this game is about building cities in ancient Egypt. In my opinion, the fun in playing games is about doing things that you can't do in real life, and city-building in ancient Egypt is a good example of one of those things. You will start by building some humble cottages and maybe even a well for your people. You will have to provide food, water, entertainment, health care etc., and as you do so, your city will evolve. If you need more money, you can build a tax collectors office. You decide how much tax the people are going to pay. Low tax will make you poor but popular (at least for a while), and high tax will make you richer but less popular. But then again, money is needed to make the city better. As your city gets bigger and better, you might even consider building the ultimate construction in the game: The Pyramid(!) If you're not interested in history now, I almost guarantee you will be after playing this game. I can't think of a game that has given me more hours of fun than this. Oh wait, the other games in Sierra's City Building series actually have: "Caesar", "Caesar II", "Caesar III", "Caesar IV", "Master of Olympus - Zeus", "Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom" are all made with this same great city-building-recipe as Pharaoh. All highly recommended (including expansions). The other games I listed are set in Rome (Roman Empire), Greece and China respectively.

Most games of the 16 bit era are not known for their stories.  This is especially true of platformers which are always more focused on level design than anything.

They will storm crocodile isle and face a lot of peril on their way to save Diddy's buddy.

This game uses stealth, which really makes it fun for a number of reasons. The graphics in this game are a little cliche, but then again, it came out in 99 and its for PS1, come on. Only problem, it's way too short. If there would have been say, another 4 or 5 hours added to the game, I would have given this game a 5. But due to its lack of lenght, I give it a 4...out of 5

Bullets are plentiful. Handgun bullets, especially. They're everywhere on easy mode. So are shotgun bullets, however, make sure you save as many shotgun bullets are you can because towards the end of the game, when enemies get meaner and angrier, they will come in handy. You don't want to come face to face with three angry lickers and only have handgun bullets with you, believe me. Also, the magnum (which is found in the beginning of the game) is the ultimate weapon.

Furthermore, and here's where you'll really hate me, I think this game is the game that Quake 3 should have been at a minimum. I mean, you've got an actual honest-to-God single player game here that's actually good. Plus you've got all the multiplay or single vs. bots action that Q3 had, and more besides--more game types, and weapons with two fire modes. Clearly these guys took a look at Unreal Tournament and said guess what: we need to incorporate some of these features. Obviously if you're such a fraghead that this is what you play games for, you wouldn't buy this instead of Q3, but the point being that Q3 would have been a much better game if they'd gone the route that this game has.

I've played this game 5 times.  Which is more than I've ever played any other RPG.  So you already know the replay value is immense.  Now for the breakdown review.

Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (and also based on the book of the same name), you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor. Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.
Music: You'll love Diddy's monkey rap and Dixie's strumming the electric guitar. Thats just when you beat the level. You will find yourself humming the beat to yourself everywhere you go. The soundtrack is so amazing that I had to download it and put it on a cd so I could listen to it wherever I go.

- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.
Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.
Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game

  But, most importantly, this game delivers a few good messages. Examples would include the threat nuclear warfare possesses on the world as well as the meaning of life. Sadly, most gamers do not take these messages in and just sees MGS as simply a game. MGS is more than a game, it is perhaps the first game to ever attempt a movie-like feel and succeed. I hope this game, as well as its creators (Konami, Hideo Kojima, and Yoji Shinkawa) will go down in history as important figures in the gaming industry.
Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)

If you haven't figured it out by now, you need to go out and play this game. Do what you have to, and make sure you go through the whole thing and enjoy yourself. A lot of people will tell you this game is over rated. Even if it is so what, it's a good game and that is all that matters. While mentioning this great FF title I suggest that you try some of the older titles that are great too, such as FFIII or FF the original. This is one of the best series of games out there and if you haven't heard of it yet then you need to have a better source of information for games. So go out and play this you will love it! I bet when you find a penny on the ground you will be thankful it helped you buy this game.

2758	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I can't remember if Myst was my first PC game.  I know it was the one that got me hooked--to the point where I kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games.  I tried to replay Myst a year ago and found I couldn't figure it out (have I lost that many brain cells over the years?), didn't have the patience or something to keep at it.  But like a first love, I remember it very fondly and treasure it.  It's almost heart breaking to think that some day soon, as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS, newbies won't be able to experience Myst.  Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock'n'roll burst forth.  To confess, I liked the graphics in Riven better.  And I never liked Artus (whatever) or his two sons--thought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems.  I loved that you could not die and nothing attacked you--really allowed [me] to explore and indulge my curiosity.  Loved the details (little bugs that moved, atmosphere, just everything).  Sound effects and "music"--wasn't Myst one of the first to put visuals and music together?  All in all, many good things started with Myst.  I know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics (something I always appreciated).  At most places, the game play wasn't strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted.  You could "spin" around and see everything.  It was totally mouse driven.  One feature I loved (but many others complained about) was that it was an empty world, you never had to/got to interact with anyone else in Myst; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart's content, go back and walk around areas that I liked (like "tree" world (can't remember it's actual name) even after you finished that level.  It is an all 'round beautiful game.

I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns.

The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.
I'm a complete convert. Until MP I had NEVER played a 3rd person game for more than an hour or so. I HATED 3rd person, it's for consoles. Now I'm on board.
At times you may even have to run in between cubes to get to the ones you must capture in order to avoid forbidden cubes.  Should you ever get crushed by the cubes, they'll automatically roll off the edge of the stage and a row will collapse.  If that happens you'll have to go through the same set again.  If you successfully capture all cubes without capturing any forbidden cubes you'll gain another row.
Don't miss out on this classic, get it now.
- A better version of a great and original game
I don't think Zelda: Link to the Past is a very challenging game, except in certain places, but it does have its fair share of tricky moments.  I guarantee you will beat it eventually though, and it's much easier than the original Legend of Zelda on the NES.  As for the music, everything sounds very clear and ahead of its time.  The music plays in all the appropriate places too.  The dark places have quiet, spooky music.  The music in the lighter, happier areas of the land give off an energetic and confident feeling, making it feel like Link is on top of the world and nothing can go wrong.  Expect to hear mellow themes which might bring you to tears.  I'll have a tissue box waiting for you in case it happens!  Supposedly the guy who created the music in this game is a master of coming up with incredibly fitting orchestral themes.  And I believe that to be true.
7125	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I am another one that has recently pulled out their old N64 to play. Looking through the bag of games I found Doom 64. My love of Doom began again.

Story: Some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9% of the females on planet earth. This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl, and then the government comes and takes her away. Meanwhile, gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world. Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.
The game features a quest pack, but I don't find it fun. They expect you to win against dozens of creatures and evil guys and God knows what else, while you control, at best six or seven creatures.
The voice acting is not very good. Some of the actors seem miscast, and suffer from uneven performances. It doesn't detract too much from the experience, but can trigger eye rolls in more cynical audiences.

4589	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Loser! The cars in this game don't leave behind any dust, they bite the dust! It's no wonder that Activision didn't dare tie this game directly into Interstate '76. There is just no comparison to the classic game. I would love to compare this game but since Activision isn't doing that I won't either. Let's go down the list of Graphics, Control, Game Play, Sound/Music, and Fun Factor. That will give or take one star for each category.

I would say, above average.  However, the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others.  It is the enjoyment level!
Although Planescape: Torment uses the same engine as Baldur's  Gate, the "camera" is closer to the ground, thus making the characters and  their immediate environment quite detailed.  However, this makes everything  very close, so ranged weapons are useless and by the time some spells are  cast, the foes are beating the @$#%^ out of you (some can't be negotiated  with!), or with some of the area spells, you get hurt as much as the enemy.  You have to learn very quickly what works.  The music score, although  sometimes tedious after many hours, contains some great themes -  Deionarra's theme in particular is so hauntingly beautiful it was worth  visiting her just to hear it.  The voice cast, containing some reasonably  well known actors, is largely wasted since, except for a few introductory  phrases, most dialogue is text.  However, among others, you will hear  Michael T. Weiss (The Pretender), Mitch Pileggi (X Files), Dan  Castellanetta (Simpsons), John DeLance ("Q" in Star Trek: TNG) and who knew  this is what Sheena Easton has been getting up to lately.
The PROS: This was a proper way to make a sequel to an arcade game that helped put Nintendo's name out there. Everything in the game worked and every aspect of it complimented each other. Playing through 100 different levels was impressive and it never felt repetitive. The new features that were never in the arcade game helped kept the game fresh even though the goal was always the same. On top of that, Donkey Kong was one of the first game to take advantage of the Super Game Boy peripheral that Nintendo released for the SNES (it played all original Game Boy games.) It did that by coming with additional colors and an exclusive border screen when you used the Super Game Boy to play the game and it looked fantastic.
The level designs have a very interesting variety of platforms and enemies, as well as some neat decorations. The game never seems to grow pretty boring at all. And along with all of the bashing, throwing, pouncing, etc you could do, there are also a few puzzle elements thrown in certain levels /:-)

It boasts large character sprites, clean, colorful graphics, a huge number of intersting levels, and who doesn't like being able to pick Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast, Gambit, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, or even Magneto to play as before each level? The plot is fairly thin (so thin you won't even notice it), but that's not where the fun factor is: clean, fast, powerful action, big, varied levels (Siberian taiga to Asteroid X to the Amazon rainforests), and big, fast bosses make this game into a Genesis masterpiece.

The bad thing about this game is that it requires way too many hours considering that it doesn't have that many levels and it's just a Fighting/Action/Adventure. I played this game for at least 3 weeks before I finally got the hang of it.
Overall 10/10

There are very few games that will ever score a perfect rating with me, but with Illusion of Gaia, I can honestly say, from the bottom of my heart, that a perfect score is what it deserves. All this time later, I still find myself popping the game in, playing it from start to finish without stopping. It's an outstanding game that deserves all the praise you have for it, and I think that, with this review, I have done it justice. Rated as my 3rd best game of all time, Illusion of Gaia is an excellent and enticing adventure that you will not want to miss!
Ultimately though, those  are just the bells and whistles.  The game-play is where it's at and that  is where Starcraft truly excels. The biggest innovation here is the truly  different races.  In past games (can you say warcraft 2?), the opposing  forces have the exact same units with different looks.  In Starcraft they  are really UNIQUE. Every side has its strengths and weaknesses and there  are no real equivalent units. Every different match-up, whether it be  protoss-zerg or terran-protoss requires a different strategy. The terrans  are mobile and do well in combined-arms, the protoss are durable, powerful  and expensive, and the zergs are numerous and frail. The single-player game  plays out well with a ten mission campaign for each race.  The campaigns  are played out in a set order (terran,zerg,protoss) Why? So you can follow  the STORY. Yes there is a story and it is very good too unlike most  Real-time strategy games. Once you finish the single player game, then you  can go online to Blizzard's free internet service for some of the best  multiplayer action there is.
After playing a hundred or so hours it will have you feeling as if you are a compitent general, capable of changing the course of history.
Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.

Baldur's Gate is about a kid (played by you) who grows up in Candle keep,under the kind tutelage of his foster father,Gorion. After a couple of years growing up,Gorion wants to move away.

But,after traveling and making friends (and making enemies),you find out your dark secret.

The courses are so fun and have neat scenery, like on Hawaii, there is the underground aquarium, and on China, the Great Wall of China. There are neat cars, also. On this game, there is no such thing as a slow car. They all have high speeds and are stylish. You can also get bonus cars, which are all really neat. The graphics are really neat, they have great details. I like how you can get bonus points for doing tricks. The easiest ones are the Mega Roll, and Jump Flip. The best course for tricks is without a doubt Germany. Crusin' World is one of the best racing games Nintendo has produced. If you enjoyed this, you'll probably like Crusin' USA.

I am looking forward to the sequel which will be coming out around the 29th of November.
If anything, I might have wished there would be a little more diversity in terms of weapons, levels, missions and some kind of a story.  Imagine the customizeability of Armored Core coupled with the furious action and beautiful graphics of this game!  However, that didn't seem to be the intention of the designers.  As an old-fashioned "blow-everything-up" shooter, Omega Boost ranks among the best there is to offer.
Playing the game, one truly gets a sense of being stranded. In essence, it puts the player in the perspective of every human being there during the outbreak. You never know who or what has been turned, nor where those beings now dwell. Caution is the only priority, and this game capitalizes on that.
Overall its a great console that I would recommend to people who want to experience some history in gaming without the loss of content from an N64 cartridge.

I have yet to beat this game, but I'm having a blast while doing so. If you have to go with one version of Donkey Kong, get this one. It has elements from the original Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. (who also makes an appearance), and, of all things, Super Mario Bros. 2. There are other notable improvements such as the ability to do backflips, performing a hand-walk to deflect barrels, and even jumping further down from one platform to another (just not too far). This game pretty much laid out the groundwork for the Mario vs Donkey Kong series and is the prequel to them. Yes, this is the first of this series, so if you loved those games, you will love this. 101 levels on a Mario platformer for less than 5 bucks is quite a bargain. Snatch this up when you can, whether it be for your GameBoy system, Super GameBoy for SNES, GameBoy Player for GameCube, or even on your 3DS. I found the cartridge of this game along with a Super GameBoy peripheral for around 11 bucks altogether so I could see how good the Super GameBoy improvements were. It's about as good as it gets, but even though it's only in black and white on the 3DS, I would recommend that one because you don't have to worry about the battery save dying and it has restore points you can bounce back on. I recommend either cartridge or download. Pick up this gem if you love Mario/Donkey Kong games. It's a great addition to add to your collection

My first experiences with 3d were with Mario 64.  I first played Nintendo 64 at a friend's house, and Wave Race 64 was one of the first games I played.  My jaw was hanging for about a half hour.  The first thing I saw was Dolphin Park - swimming dolphins, fish, "splashy" sounding music, backflips, barrel rolls, and BEAUTIFUL water.  It was too much!  What a surreal experience!  After I got back up from fainting, my friend and I played this game for HOURS and HOURS and HOURS and HOURS.  We would go to Southern Island and tried to find what we could ramp over, go under, and crash into.  It sounds pathetic, but I've had some of the best times of my life playing Wave Race 64 with friends.

One of the interesting  twists of Jedi Knight is that your alignment towards the dark side or the  light side is determined by how many innocent people you kill or by certain  moral decisions you make as the game progresses.

Even though "Age of Empires II" is beginning to be dated, the game is still excellent and worth the money. This will be one to go down as a "classic", very similar to "Warcraft II". A definite buy.
The different levels are fun, with their atmosphere and backgrounds. The music is on the generic side and doesn't go themed with the world you're in, as more modern fighters tend to do. Also it is sometimes fairly easy to simply knock your opponent out of the ring and be done with it.


UPDATE: I found out a really cool Easter egg. In 1-Player mode, someone can actually control Tails as the second player! This is pretty much the closest thing to a 2-Player co-op mode. Although Sonic still hogs the camera, your friend can help collect rings, defeat the bosses, get rings in special stages, and he/she can just plain goof off. After all, Tails IS invincible, so he won't lose rings or lives for Sonic.
Overall, the game is awesome and challenging. This is the Sonic game all fans should get.

One thing that felt a bit lacking in this game was a lack of storyline. It can be summed up in a few sentences. You're father went missing. Go find him. While you're at it save the world. But, you come to expect this from older video games so it didn't detract too much from the game.
I especially love the verbal taunts after a 'critical' hit or misses...like "DIE!", "Did you see that?" and "Damn" The special effects are cool too. Spells, healing animations, critical hits and such.

9064	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Donkey Kong Country really pushed the limits of what the SNES could do. The graphics were very ahead of their time. I don't normally rate graphics, but this game gets points just because it had 3-d textures and characters in a 2-side scroller, which was a first for games back then. Also, the sound design in this game is great. Each sound is clear, and you can easily distinct the step of one of those fat brown dudes with the green army helmets from the sound of a crocodile's mouth opening and closing. This game is loads of fun, with two characters who you can switch between depending on what the situation calls for. There are tons of secrets to find, and riding around on the animals is an experience a true gamer could never forget. This game serves up great challenge without getting too hard. The levels in this game are brilliantly designed, and make for deeply addictive gameplay. If you like this one, check the second and third one also, as the series builds on its weak points as well as its strong points, making for great, well rounded gameplay in all of the games.

9308	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	One main gimmick (the bullet-time feature) and some decent graphics. That's all this overrated game really offers. And not only is it a 1.5 trick pony, but it's a very short one, too...you can finish it the same day you receive it.

If you're new to fighting games, this is a good place to start, with lots of easy combo strings and flashy moves, with enough depth to justify spending a week or two learning the ins and outs of your favorite character. Unfortunately, hardcore fans will be disappointed with the emphasis on uncounterable pokes, double reversals and insane float combos.

Replay Value: 6.5/10
Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run.  It doesn't ruin your game permanently, but it ruins itself just fine.  There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working.

No the graphics aren't AMAZING, the voice acting is not AMAZING, the game-play is not the most intuitive, and the camera angles...let's face it are just plain horrible through most of the game. All that being said, it is still a piece of Dreamcast history and Sonic history as well. A real Sega/Sonic fan would have this game.
From its exciting beginning to its great ending, Final Fantasy VIII is one of the best RPG's to grace the Playstation, or any console.
Where the  game flags, I suppose, is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film.  There's no ability to eliminate opposition by "dirty tricks", and  you can't disable the "i-crashed-but-now-i-have-a-new-racer"  feature.  The pod racers are absolutely indestructible here (though they  can be seriously damaged) and that's a disappointment.  I would've liked a  "harder-edged" version--perhaps one you could toggle on and  off--but it's a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effort.
This is the game that got me back to playing games that actually have a story.


Graphics: (4/5) - Would be 8/5 when this first came out!
Gameplay
I will admit that once you got good at the difficult parts (usually after the bikes because it felt like it was impossible), you got really good at the rest of the game. There were still parts here and there but other than that you could deal.
All of this detracts a bit, but it's a testament to the strength of the concept and execution that this would still be a five-star game, even with these issues. The killer--the thing that made me subtract a star--is the track-laying interface. It's really easy to lay track you didn't mean to. There's no undo. It actually costs you to remove it. The way the UI figures out the smoothest route is dubious, and there's really no decent handling for the fact that finding the smoothest track is best done at the closest zoom while finding the shortest route is best done at the furthest zoom.

Is sad to hear that sega is not making anymore Dreamcast this year because PS2 is a top seller,but I hope the game maker like Capcom,Eidos,Activision and other company that support Dreamcast still make more game this year.

No real story is going on here; there are no characters  and nothing happens inside of a mission to alter the plot. There are some  vague cutscenes between the missions, but they're so irrelevant that you  could have just played the missions and made up your own story to string  them together.

Gameplay:9/10(Exactly like RE except you have 3D graphics instead of 2D)




The graphics for this game are cartoon based, very colorful and full of life. Some of the terrain where battles take place can be mundane, almost eye sore. I say this mainly due to the fact that your crew of fighters level up FF style, so random battles in grasslands and deserts constantly, can make for very boring backgounds. Not all is bad though. As you progress the story, areas inside castles and around civilized structures are a pleasent and much needed change of pace. The level of detail is limited due to the angle and distance the game platform is structured on but does not take away from the experience.

Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.

During your visit at Raccoon city you will encounter, what many call the best RE boss (and they are right, of course): T- type Tyrant code named Nemesis. Be ready, because this BIG guy will make you know the true meaning of the word "HORROR" as he will follow you to every room and stage you go. He is relentless and almost invincible. So, make sure you save your best weapons and cures for every encounter with this guy.

It's extremely rare to find  a sequel that improves on the original =without= rendering them obsolete.  (HoMM I and HoMM II are today almost as playable as this game, lacking only  the polish and convenience that comes from so many years of refinement.)  This is only achieved by making the game different enough so that you have  to change or refine your thinking about it.

Sega honestly doesn't have any games that I really want to play.  Even when first coming out over a year ago, there were few games that really caught my eye.  Carrier was one of them because I thought the premise was better than the Resident Evil games (which I don't care for...).  I needed a fighter and Streetfighter fulfills that.  I have DOA2 on the way, but the game that made me buy the DC was Phantasy Star On-Line.
Even without the GBC version, this is a top-flight golf game in its own light. Add the Game Boy Color version and a Transfer Pak and you have a keeper.
  Ord Mantell Junkyard: 10/10 - This whole level takes place on hover trains (except the boss) and its very fun to kill enemies on moving vehicles.
Being a 1999 game it has "primitive" graphics.. no 3D etc as in today's games, but I still think they're decent. Also, like Civ II, this is not a half-hour game.. it can go on for some time.. but at least you can save it and pick it up later.


This game would have made a better pre-realease game because it prepares you for the most grueling parts of MGS. So if your a new comer to the MGS series get this game first its ideal for training you for the real game.
The story for this game is pretty good.  The bad guy in it is cool.. The bosses are loads of fun.  House of the Dead II is one of the best gun games you can find for a system.
Funny characters. You cannot tell me that you cannot relate to Squall's stubbornness. Or Zell's funny attitude.(Barret anybody?)
Unfortunately, "Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island", as of November 2012, has not been released on the Wii's Virtual Console due to difficulties emulating the Super FX 2 chip.

Here's holding out hope Nintendo will re-release this awesome game so more gamers can experience its amazing goodness!

The graphics for this game was superb when it first came out. No one still really cared too much about them yet & Square really showed them off for this game (this game was originally in production for the N64) except for the fact that you have blocks as hands! I believe the main game for the N64 wasn't completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having CG clips for the PlayStation they went with that system instead. So for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one, im pretty sure thats your answer. The CG movies still look amazing for the ps1, granted that Square got better at it with FFVIII. Either way, Square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake (to make this game look REALLY NICE) which is still in question, however they have other games they're working on now

Cloud Strife is one of the most recognizable faces in video games today, in addition to wielding one of video games' most iconic weapons. He is also a snarky jerk, certifiably insane, and, in true JRPG protagonist fashion, is better than everyone else in the world at everything, including snowboarding, chocobo riding, and sustaining multiple shotgun blasts to the face. Even with a more mature perspective, I still can't help liking Cloud. He remains consistently interesting all the way up to Act 3, which is about when he loses the attitude, sorts out his mental luggage, and become another vanilla JRPG hero. The big revelation regarding his identity in Act 2 is right on par with FFVI villain Kefka and his apocalyptic hijinks as one of the most genuinely shocking twists in a video game narrative.

All 32 levels from the NES classic are back, in all their pixelated glory. The music is left unchanged from the NES as well! Plus, once you beat the 32 normal levels, you get to play through them again in an expert mode with tougher enemies more common and smaller lifts. Beat those and you get 32 NEW levels, from the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (these are often called "The Lost Levels" in America.) In addition to these amazing features, there is a challenge mode where you must find a hidden Yoshi egg, 5 red coins, and get a high score. There's even a mode where you have to race to the end of a unique level against Boo! Lastly, the game contains several extras you can print out with your Game Boy Printer, which increase in number as you progress through the game. BY ALL MEANS PURCHASE THIS GAME IF YOU OWN A GBC or GBA.

However, just let you know, this game does still have the 'clunky' 'tank controls' associated with RE games. However, due to the Dreamcast's analog stick, it will be slightly easier to master the steering of this game then, for instance, the Gamecube REmake.
NBA Hang Time was the very first full-length Basketball video game for the Nintendo 64, giving newcomers who had just bought the smash console a chance to really get some air. Hang Time had also created something new to the mix that makes it all seem interesting. The game is a bit similar to NBA Jam, but there was something a little different. The game also included a create a player mode, a mode where instead of speding a few quarters at the arcade, you can createyour very own basketball player, by controlling how tall you want him, how good he can block you, and even how good his aim is for the hoop.

3200	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Not that this game is "old", but when you consider it's a game from 1999 that's exclusive to a dead console system, it's amazing to realize that this game is arguably better than any other combat game out there even today. The graphics made full use of the Dreamcast's capabilities, and even now it is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. The combat moves are fluid and based on real martial arts...there is even a martial arts display mode where you can see all the characters doing various weapon katas! It is a good game for both button mashers and pros. There is no "blood" which makes it a bit unrealistic when you see someone getting hacked with a huge axe and not bleeding; but that doesn't detract from the experience because this isn't that sort of game. The abundance of modes allows for a high replay value. The only thing I would knock is the end-stories, which are a bit corny and considering the animation in the gamplay itself, it feels a bit like a copout to see the endings as just still life. However, that's all nitpicking.
Ultimately, Silent Hill holds up, but not as well as Silent Hill 2. It's still a classic in its genre with a great setting and levels, but if you can't get past the dated presentation, you can knock a star off of this review.

Overall, the game is one of those games that should be played by all gamers.  Yeah, there are problems (the story, the somewhat dated graphics, the linear game play), but it's still an amazing play.  By the way, you can download the game from the Playstation Store for both the PSP and PS3 for [...]- so do not pay these insanely high prices.

All in all this game had awesome potential but was poorly executed.  Much of this could have been avoided by having 1. more predictable and sane camera angles, and 2. a strategy guide.  A lot of times I was stuck for hours and I missed some hidden place or something.  With a quick cheat I would have had a lot more fun without feeling too guilty.

I've heard other complaints about this game.  Granted, they're not popular complaints (and only a small amount of people actually believe them).  But I happen to be one of those people, and the complaint I'm speaking of is the lack of enemies throughout the planet.  Many times you find yourself walking across boring empty areas, desperately searching for something to shoot.  An example would be walking from the spaceship all the way to the Wrecked Ship area.  On your way you only see a couple enemies around, and if you ask me there should be a LOT more.  To be fair, again, this isn't a major complaint, but the more you play the game the more you notice things like this, and in the end you wish more weird-looking creatures or space pirates were around so you'd have something to shoot as you walk to the next area.  I guess this is probably just me complaining about "never having enough".  Well, tough.  This is how I am, so you mine as well get used to it. :)

Many levels and a high difficulty make this game a must have for any Star Wars or gaming fan.

I've heard too many people whine about  the save feature, but I think that we, as a role-playing community, have  gotten too dependant on save features.  Save less, not more.
Graphics: Although you can probably debate this, this has one of the best graphics you'll find on the system. Lot of areas just drop that "wow factor", like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes.
3824	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I thought with Playstations Madden 99 I had the only football game I'd need for years. But when my brother got the Game Cube, Playstation 2, and XBox, he gave me his Dreamcast, and a few games along with it, NFL 2K being one of them. Turns out, this is a great game. The graphics are good and game play is as good as anything on Playstation. You can force trades to create your dream team, and while you can't play a franchise, you can save your season. The passing game is a little easy, bu it makes up by making a tougher running game. And lik most of Dream Cast's sports games, it is well done and fun. Would I pick this over Madden 99? probably not, but it is a nice addition, and the two games are fun to own together.
But other than those problems, the game is great.

I recommend all RE fans to get this version.
Voices are horrible in this game...Listen to it in Japanes...It's better then the horrible English voice acting..But the music and sound make up for it..4/5
Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area.

Sure, by today's standards, the graphics are primitive and full of sprites and look a little blocky when you're up close....the enemies and items are modeled in 2D, meaning you can never look at their backside....and heck, you can't even jump....but....WHO CARES? This game is heaven, and even today, will still scare the (...) out of you....even if you memorized the location of every enemy in the game, knowing what to expect around every corner.

I really enjoyed this game, it was fantastic.  I loved the graphics for this game it was just "wow".  The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as.  They both have 2 parts(kina).  Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character.  The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game.  The game has some great twists that'll keep you up all night.  Lemmi make it easier for you...Resident Evil 2 was one of the coolest Playstation games ever.  It had an awesome story line, sweet graphics and decent dialoug.  It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game.  In other words the game is awesome and scary.
4863	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile. It blows it is a boring extremely hard game. I liked the movie option, graphics and real car phisics. The story was okay not great. The controls were horrible. The missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring. The first mission took us 3 weeks to fufill. Also your stuck in the car driving around. The missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path. It's not even challenging fun. It is more like boring impossible!! Also you can't see in front of you. I'm still on the first city. On the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies. Also there are driving games like pursuit and Getaway, carnage, surviver and time trials ect. There fun for a while you can also turn them into movies. Also I think this has much improovement from the PS1 version by far. But still this game is horrible. The story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving I've ever seen. If you want a fun wide variety driving game for the PC reserve GTA3.
Thought Super Mario World was big, didn't you?  That game looks microscopic compared to Yoshi's Island.  As I mention above, trying to get a 100% score in every level is a MAJOR reason the game is so much fun, because you have a reason to replay Yoshi's Island over and over.  In some levels you may be left wandering around for a long time until you find all the red coins, flowers and stars.  If you ask me, any one of the levels in Yoshi's Island is TWICE as long as the ones in Super Mario World, and probably three or four times bigger than the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Nintendo really went out of their way to bring Mario fans the biggest adventure yet, and the funny thing about the game is how it didn't receive as much attention as you'd expect when it hit stores in 1995.


8832	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This awesome fighting game came free with the SNES my mother bought for my brother and myself many years ago.  Unfortunately, she would only let us play the game once a week for one hour because of the violence.  We loved the game so much, but for some reason (probably because we were tired of only being able to play once a week) we ended up selling it to our neighbor and never saw it again.  However, I recently ordered it from Amazon so I can relive the thrill.
3075	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Sure, the word "epic" is thrown around a lot on the back covers of games, but this game really is one. Of course, you can probably tell that from the fact that it's three discs long. From the great music to the excellent battle system to the plot with a depth rarely seen in video games to the wonderful graphics... okay, so the graphics aren't wonderful. In fact, they suck. The exception to the graphics comes in the fairly cool looking occasional movie scenes. Not being a huge RPG fan, I took the fairly direct route through the game. RPG extremists have a ton more to do, from raising chocobos to fighting that (expletive deleted) Ruby Weapon. Also, the special attacks are really cool. They range from fancy swordfighting techniques like cross-slash to a guy who turns into popular horror movie characters (a Jason imitation, complete with chainsaw, helped me defeat Safer Sephiroth) . Anyway, this is a great game that is worth more than twenty bucks, so get it.

The environments, while not necessarily beautiful, are well done. There are a total of five islands, all with different motifs. These islands, or "ages" include:
Even the single-player mode was fun. Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.

But Donkey Kong 64 is still an amazing game. Even if you hate the repetition, you can't overlook the technological wonders Rare has instilled. The game had been one of the most stunning five years ago, as Rare was already setting themselves up as one of the experts in graphical achievements. Although each Kong look rather bland now, the game's visuals are certainly pleasing on the eyes. However, the same can't be said about the game's camera. The camera can often go crazy at times, especially during swimming moments or on Diddy's Jet Barrels. Those are times when I go on a cursing frenzy. There are other equally frustrating times. I suppose the camera had always been the death of 3D platform/adventure games. The game's music is terrific. Although people have a love/hate relationship with the infamous D.K. Rap, the rest of the game's soundtrack are lovely. Songs like the Main Menu music and Frantic Factory are catchy, while Fungi Forest can actually send a chill down your spine. And then there's the humor. Actually, some of the game's humor seems to be kind of forced, but then again, the same can be said about the humor in Banjo-Kazooie. Other parts are genuinely funny. However, as spectacular as the game is, the game's tedium and spotty camera keeps it from becoming a classic. It's too bad. Nintendo had such high hopes for this game.

After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.
1926	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Few games have endured in my collection like Resident Evil 2. The graphics are old, dated, and painful in the year 2011 where Dead Island and Dead Rising 2 are the dominant Zombie games. But it looks well enough to play for days and months on end. The gameplay is clunky and clumsy, but it is a horror game designed to make you feel inadequate and somewhat unprepared for the adventure you are thrown into. The story is Sci-Fi Originals bad and in hard to understand, but that was what they were going for.
5148	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Game came shipped with original case, manual, and two discs. The game works perfect, but I do have to warn that the first boss of the game occurs very early and can be a bit difficult to new players. This game is one of the best games in terms of storyline and is a must-get for any player looking for a storyline with heavy depth to it.
Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.
The game has a good plot, good graphics and good action. In multiplayer it's even better, but the system of finding a server could have been easier and more straight-forward. Matching is done via a Microsoft website where you can find games and chatrooms and you also need to have installed Zonematch, a small program similar to MSN Messenger. In my opinion everything should be incorporated into an in-game multiplayer interface, just like the majority of other titles out there.

*RESIDENT EVIL: SURVIVOR
7418	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To put it simply. I am not hardcore into vampires, I am not a goth and most things vampiric these days are more annoying then "cool" in my opinion. So for me to say that Legacy of Kain is by far one of the greatest series of games ever made, is really saying something about the quality that this game puts out. It is an older game, so obviously the graphics are no longer going to impress. However I thought that the way the camera was set up, really set the stage for this game to succeed as greatly as it did. When it comes to the story, I am just truely amazed at the people who wrote the script to this game. It is truely an amazing story. Kain is such an interesting character, and he has many abilities. So many abilities and items and transformations in fact, that I would be willing to wager that present day games don't allow you to do as many things as Kain is able to in this old playstation 1 game. It really gives you the feel of being an amazing Vampire. The character Kain is more of an anti-hero, which is something I think is refreshing, since it isn't seen very often in video games. The game is presented very well, with the start menu where you select your armor/weapons/spells being very well drawn out. This game however shines most in the voice work. Simon Templeman (the voice of Kain) is by far the greatest voice actor ever to work in the business. He even outshines Tim Curry, and with the level of respect I have for Tim Curry, that is saying something indeed. I find that my favorite thing about this game is listening to how the conversations are worded. They present it in an old english sort of way, that really does well for the game. So in closing, if you are looking for a game that is truely amazing, and can appreciate an older game, Legacy of Kain will not disappoint. I am the type of gamer who has such a low attention span for video games, that I usually cant play a game for more then 2 hours before I quit it and never pick it up again. I have beaten Legacy of Kain Blood Omen several times, as well as all the other games in the series, and never find myself growing tired of them. They are just that well made, with the intention of the game developers clearly indicating that they wanted to make very good quality games, over just something to turn a profit.

It arrived and I loaded it on my computer and was sad to say it would not work.  I contacted the seller to arrange for a refund which they had no problems doing but at the last minute I remembered I had a old laptop.  I tried turning the laptop on but it would not work so I inspected it further to discover that one of the pins on the power connector was bent and I was able to fix it and boot up it up running Windows XP.  I installed the game on the computer and it ran with no problems.  It was good to see the game again.
My only issue is that this disc doesn't play right in the PS2.  The cursor is messed up and you need your old Playstation to see it as it was designed.  Real Bummer.  If anyone knows a fix please feel free to comment it on the bottom of this review.
So basically, I've had the card 2 weeks without any problems, dropped it many times, still works great.  Many people are complaining about problems after a month or so, so if I do have problems, then you'll see a negative comment from me.  As of right now, I recommend this card.

It really is. And then watch all the poor slaves run away turn by turn.

Resident Evil 2 introduces Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, who would go on to star in future hit installments Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Code: Veronica (respectively speaking). Leon is a rookie cop in Raccoon City and meets up with Claire during an infestation of zombies and other monsters in the small town that is on the brink of destruction. Together, they must get out and survive while Claire is focusing on finding her brother, Chris Redfield. It's a simple plot, simple premise. The gameplay might feel stiff to those accustomed to the control scheme of games such as Resident Evil 4 and 5, but trust me: if you give it time, you will find it fun and rewarding after a short while.
Seriously, this game is so FUN!  I do wish you could get money for the trees instead of paying to have them taken away.  But that's a minor concession.
The most annoying problem though, by far, is the sidestepping.  Though this may be a cool feature, it is also horribly abused.  The computer AI seems to have an obsession with it, sidestepping constantly (I've timed it--they never go more than 2 seconds without sidestepping, even when they aren't being attacked).  Now, this doesn't sound like much, but it really is a huge problem.  The constant sidestepping also rotates the game's camera.  This makes the computer impossible to hit with any straightforward attack because you are never properly aligned with them.  Combine this with the slow recovery times, and you'll run into situations like this:  You smack the enemy with the first hit in a combo which, logically, should set him up for the next hit, right?  Wrong.  Because of the unbalanced recovery times, he'll recover before your second swing ever comes out, and he'll sidestep, then stand there watching as you go off swinging at the air in some odd direction.  Then he'll automatically turn to face you and hit you in the back of the head (since your character takes forever to re-align himself properly when he isn't facing the opponent--another design flaw).  The constant camera rotation (or, swirling, to be more precise) makes you lose all orientation on the playing field.  Add to this archaic features such as "Ring Out" (which should have gone out in the Jurassic period of fighting games), and you have an unplayable, nerve-wracking mess.  Basically, you will lose many matches from being smacked in the back of the head as the computer rotated the camera on you, or by cheap Ring Outs because you couldn't see where you were on the battlefield (again, because the computer rotated the camera on you).
this really is a lot of fun for everyone.  would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music (singing)...
5154	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Love this game!  only downfall is the extremely long cut scenes kinda felt like I was watching a movie...but overall awesome game.
Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine are your two main playable characters accompanied by Barry Burton, Albert Wesker, Rebecca Chambers, Brad Vickers, Enrico Morini, Edward Dewey, Forest Spyer, Richard Aiken, Joseph Frost, and Kenneth Sullivan most of which will end up dead before the end of the game, which isn't revealing much as most people know about this game.  One of the main points of the story is the isolation and being alone searching for your fellow teammembers.  If there's 12 of them in all and the main idea of the game is isolation and terror you better believe you'll find some dead teammembers along the way.  The story is pretty much known around the world.  STARS Alpha team has been sent to investigate STARS Bravo team's dissapearence in the woods near a mansion that belongs to Umbrella.  The T-Virus (Tyrant) has been let loose and killed the employees turning them into zombies, and unleashing other creatures (Hunters AH!).  The game itself really isn't that long,  once you learn the puzzle solutions you could breeze through it in a few hours (for which you may be rewarded).  The Arrange mode on this Director's Cut version features different uniforms for Jill and Chris and some different camera angles and puzzle solutions.  Items will be switched around to different locations as well.  The overall "scare" factor of this game is pretty nil, but you might jump at a few spots.  The graphics are dated, sure, but they're basic and likeable.  You can tell what's going on and still see extra details (unlike the remake where the entire game is a pile of details upon the next pile).  One of the most famous  aspects of this game is the voice acting and FMV sequences with actual actors (if you even want to call them that).  The in game voice acting, when you actually find a fellow STARS member alive, is pretty terrible.  I'd like to track these people down and see if they haven't been murdered because of it.  The FMV sequences are pretty classic also, the opening is the same for eather game and the endings are different depending on who you save during your adventure as Chris or Jill.  FINAL NOTE:  I highly recommend this game (the Director's Cut version since it has 4 games total) even if it is extremely old to anyone!  The "explicit scenes of blah blah) at the beginning of the load don't really make a difference as it's all squares anyway, but this game is actually REALLY fun to play through.  I think anyone who has moderate video gaming experience should play this.  You might have to get used to the controls, but they don't really bother me.

Pros
For kids who's parents don't like them getting violent games, probably don't want this because of how discusting it is to kill one of the people running on the ground. It reminds me of Half-life.
 Beating the game in under three and a half hours with no saves, and no using of health sprays will net you an infinite rocket launcher in your chest the next time you play the game.  This was a hard feat to manage, but by around my sixth time through the game, I finally did it.  It gave me almost a good a feeling as the first time I beat the game for the first time.

You are Cloud, a selfish newcomer to a resistance group known as AVALANCHE. You don't care about the planet. No way. As soon as this job is done, you want to get your cut and split. The dialogue is truly something else. And the storyline, WOW! The whole idea of a city on a "plate" was really original and appealing. Great movie-sequences. I could go on and on praising this game. Even after playing Final Fantasy 9 I can't help but go back and play this great game. Yeah, it is more science fiction than fantasy, but it is science fiction done RIGHT. Although the game is only three CD's long, the game lasts anywhere from 40 to 80 hours. In the first CD, you spend 6 hours in the huge city of Midgar alone. Then you go on for another 10 hours or so, before going to disc 2. This game has great music, especially the ending boss music. That song is called "One-Winged Angel". By the way, Sephiroth is pronounced, "Sea-fee-roth". At least that's how they pronounce it in the song. Speaking of Sephiroth, he's really cool. Definitely the best villian I've ever seen. Overall, this is either the first or second best RPG I've ever played. First place might go to Final Fantasy 6.

9783	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This has been a go-to since i first got it in 1998...I am a huge Resident evil fan and everything just gels with this release...The story is top notch, The game play is classic,the enemies are killer and the score is right up there with silent hill. I'm not going to go into what goes on in this game, I'd rather it unfold for you in game play so you can have as amazing an experience as i did all those years ago. But if you are a survival horror Fan as I am and haven't given this a go...You owe it to yourself to do so.

It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.

Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5

5302	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Of all the war games me and my sons have played.  This was by far the one of the most fun, I loved how the enemy soldiers were programmed to respond to noises and attacks, very realistic. No matter how many times we played a level trying to get off, it never got dull because the enemies didn,t respond always the same. It was very fun making mistakes,like accidentally throwing grenades at my partner or setting explosives to close and for getting to tell my partner. The only disapointment was not enough levels, but for the price this game was well worth it.

Now the scenarios...Yes, unlike  many expansion this does very well in delivering MANY more scenarios that  will keep you posted to your screen for hours on end, you definitely get  your moneys worth here.  However, where as the original scenarios were a  tad easy, the expansion scenarios are a bit hard at times.  You are so  rushed on meeting requirements at times, you don't have the time to truly  design the ride you wanted to make, but rather forced to using the  pre-built coasters in any available space you can find.  This detracts from  the main function of the game...the chance to build and experiment your own  steel monsters.

At such a young age most of the games out were too complicated for me and I had to find something I could understand. Enter Mario Kart 64. This game is pure and simple, you pick a character and race with seven other famous Nintendo stars in 16 detailed (for N64, anyway) stages. This was one of the N64's first games, so for me it turned the system into a classic which I still play today.

5200	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The cons for this game under description products stating that : Puzzles can be frustrating and that torture scene too intense for younger gamers. To me this was stupid. Most of the easy games can be boring. This game gets you be involved in the story and it's very easy too follow if you are a serious gamer. Also, mature games are supposed to be harder than kid's games. The puzzles are not that frustrating if you can think maturely (even kids can pass this game with any problem). About "Torture scene too intense for younger gamers", I think there is a reason why they labeled this game Mature. Mature games are not for kids. This game is one of the best I've ever played. Great Story, Great Collection.

I played this on my P4 (2Ghz) XP machine without any hick-ups.  I haven't tried multi-player yet, but managed to get by without downloading the 20mb patch (which I eventually installed for the heck of it  the only difference Ive noticed is that Seven is actually voiced by Jeri Ryan).  EF isn't as finicky about your choice of accelerator cards, accepting my S3 Savage4 card.  In short, a great Trek game, and one not to be missed before Elite Force 2.
7/10 Replayability
The CONS: The only thing that I could say here is that this was one of the last batch of Super Nintendo games that was released as the Sony Playstation was making huge waves and the world was waiting for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo's next console, to be released. It's not a knock on the game itself at all but it was just the timing of its release that makes it unique.
the only three ways that I would like to see it improved would be
24 missions for a total of 54 missions! Not too bad for any game and the expansion is clearly one of the best there ever has been. The cutscenes add to the story and a pretty good graphically and great musically. A total joy to play. The only downside to the game is playing against another live person. I played this game against a friend of mine at least 12 times and we had 11 ties and I won once. The crystals and Vespene gas run out before a winner could be decided. Other than that, this is an awesome game, even today and with this package deal this is an excellent buy. Happy gaming.

-While the SNES probably had better graphics, color palettes, and scaling effects, I still have yet to see a SNES game with as smooth of the gameplay framerate as any Genesis Sonic title (I'm talking about normal in-game play that's NOT a special FX chip or anything like that).

- Silent Hill
While it took me several times to go through the game (and beat it) which for some people who don't understand the story will have to play it through a few times. The thing that people get most confused on is the materia setup.  While it was easy for me to grasp some people were like 'huh!?!?' It's like trying to teach a cat how to drive.  I thought this concept was easier then some of the FF games that came out after this one.  But yet again, easy for some, hard for others.
-Environment
Seriously, that was a pretty scary moment. Anyway, the graphics are exceptional for the N64 but playstation are better. The music/sound effects are better on the playstation but are acceptable on the N64. There are two people you can pick and two difficulty settings. Pretty nifty. There is a violence setting where you can have it high, medium or low. Kids under 10, I suggest low. High is pretty bad when you die. Medium is average.
This controller is great for RPGs, like Skies of Arcadia, fighter games like Soul Calibur, and platform games like Sonic Adventure.  But don't buy Hidden and Dangerous, or Rainbow Six, or even Quake III Arena, because after playing FPS's on XBOX and PS2, shooter games on Dreamcast are really a step down.
It's a simple beat em up with the Power Rangers and two player co-op.
The maps of the levels are truly vast as well which makes the game much more challenging and interesting, and the fact that many are outdoors, (desert, jungle, highlands, woods, temple ruins, and finally hell) as opposed to spending the entire game in one long dungeon.
Street Fighter Alpha 3 is (in my opinion) the best Street Fighter game available (including the recently-released SF2 HD Remix). The gameplay is a blend of the slow-paced and strategic Street Fighter 2 and the more varied and frenetic Alpha series. Air combos, alpha counters, and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategy.
The game tries to follow the movie's storyline by telling it in between certain levels. After waiting for the first part of the story to end, you will end up shooting everything in sight! There are robots coming from both sides of the screen, and enemy planes flying in the sky. Kill them all!! That sums up the whole game pretty much, but the awesome action would obviously keep you playing.

  The original three button control was awful and I am glad they made this one because this is the opposite,it's great. The Sega Genesis is almost perfect,in my opinion the Sega Saturn and Playstation control is perfect and have a great grip and nice button layout. Anyways,the Genesis 6 button control is ideal for fighting,platform,and everything else you can play with. The controls are reliable and cheap,so if you have a Sega Genesis you must get this control.
I remember Tomba! back when I was a kid. That was a really great game then. It even is for today but of course shows it's flaws more now. The story of Tomba! is about pigs...evil pigs.

The story, itself(as you probably already know by playing it), is about Cloud Strife. Cloud is a mercenary who joins with a group of others(Avalanche) to stop a megacorporation callled Shinra. Shinra is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Course, the story progresses and deepens when Sephiroth(the game's main antagonist) comes into play. Sephiroth's part in this story?...if the world is damaged, its' Lifestream will gather together in an attempt to heal the wound. Sephiroth plans to use a powerful spell called "Meteor" to cause this injury, and then merge with the planet's energy, allowing him to be reborn as a god. Then, he plans to rule over the planet.

While navigating the empty streets of RC the soundtrack also gives you that feeling of solitude and that at any moment something can come up jumping at you from every corner or any hole in the ground. My personal favorite is the song at the fianal battle with the Nemesis, which by the way is SOOOO EPPICCCC!!!!

It is the type of RTS that is "hard and fast," you build, build, build, fight, fight, fight, and either win or  lose, sometimes having the chance to revive if you lost the first battle.  It is different from other great RTS like AOE2 because the latter is more  fun when you build a great army w/ diverse units and attack tactically,  while Starcraft is more like building a giant swarm and either going  straight thru or catching the opponent by surprise...(what I mean is: while  AOE2 resembles real combat more, Starcraft is idealistic but  fun).

This is an excerpt from the highly-acclaimed Shakespeare, with a modern twist of steampunk and grit. Grunge-esque.
This is where the intense fun comes on.  You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content.

Protoss:Dark Templar:The Dark templar are indeed powerfull units.  They move swiftly and attack vicously and with extreme speed and on top of that they are permenately cloaked.

If you liked it (you will!) try playing these other games of the same flavor: The Sim City series, by Maxis, that started the entire genre. There's the other sim games, as well, such as Sim Farm. Sid Meyer games can sometimes be very similar to Chris Sawer, but also very different. Give them a try. And of course, Chris Sawer's other work: Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, Transport Tycoon, Locomotion, and others. I can't recommend RCT 3, however: It was made by a large team (against his philosophy) of designers and licensed to an outside corporation, and Chris Sawer was mostly symbolically involved.  It lacks the pluck, humor, and addictive game play, and frankly, I wouldn't pay too much for it.

everything, while outdated in looks, is so realistic.  which is maybe why i liked this title so much.  that, and the characters are freaking amazing.  Solid Snake is my hero, and i wish he were a real person so i could meet him and get a picture of him a cardboard box.  this is another reason why i like the game and the rest of the series, the humor.  while funny, most of it still has a point. sure, it's funny to see a guy sneaking around under a box, but it's also very stealthy and strategic.  as long as you don't move while the enemy is watching, you're good to go.  using the box is like an ongoing game of red light green light.  except in this game you can pop out and break the guy's neck.  also, knocking on walls is sometimes funny, but all the time useful.  knock on a wall to lure an enemy into a mine you secretly placed near a truck.  there are countless ways to enjoy dispatching your enemies, even without the use of weapons.  leading them around circles with your footprints in the snow is also humorous.
I got my unit in March 2000, and it is still running great. Unreal Tournament is the only game to give me trouble. (After exchanging the disc already, I just contacted Infogrames' support just before writing this review.) Version 3.0 of the web browser also seems unstable. If you can find it, I'd recommend Version 2.6 which was included with The Official Dreamcast Magazine. Version 2.0 was also included with a few issues. The keyboard and mouse (with a scroll wheel) are also nice additions if you plan to do any web browsing with the Dreamcast. Without them, you use the game controller as a pointing device and use an onscreen keyboard to type. Although it might have trouble with some Java sites, it works well as an inexpensive system you can travel with to check email. It supports any POP3 email account. As for web based email, it just depends on how the site is programmed. I haven't tried the web based accounts on it recently so I can't make a reliable comment on that. The Dreamcast should have some version of the browser included even if it's not the latest. I doubt it ships with 3.0.

Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it. You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time. It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one. This is one of the best N64 games ever.
It's a blast to customize the mechs with whatever weapons you find, and even better to salvage enemy mechs, which always have a slight advantage in firepower and speed. There's nothing quite like mousing over a storage bin and seeing the context-sensitive cursor change into a pair of pliers (or whatever they are, indicating that there's something to get in there).

While it may be SEVERLY outdated, it's the system that really helped the Gameboy line last almost a decade alone without a new release (well this was released, im talking aout this and the original Gameboy).  With it's affordable price of only fifty bucks, it shows how Nintendo is so damn good at making portable gaming systems.  With that price, along with the huge game library, I can't help but think why Sega even bothered.  The Nomad and Game Gear were fine, but it showed that they should not have even tried.

Great game, you can make it rather easy, or extremely challenging; a great option to the game. Highly recommended to anybody who likes side scrollers/ or anybody who just wants a great game with re-playability. True classic.
The graphics in this game are immense, very brightly colored and textured to the best of their abilities. As I played through this as a child, I thought I was at the locations from the movie. Now playing them as a twenty one year old, I must say I am almost just as impressed. For being on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the graphics are very well laid out. Colorful and vibrant, with just as many textures as they could cram in back then. Truly a visual spectacular worthy of a Star Wars title.
The sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting. The soundtrack consists of strange, sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area. Moreover, the sounds are integral to the gameplay, for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing. You will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face. This is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game. The music makes your surroundings feel foreign and believable.

8939	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	You quitly step out of your spaceship onto the sandy, damp ground of an unexplored planet. Suddenly, a giant flash of lightning appears as it starts to rain heavily. You nervously look behind you. Nothing there. In a hurry to get away from the rain, you run under a near cave. After going through an old, broken door another lighting flashes and an intemidating roar of thunder follows. You slowly continue to walk through the abondoned, lifeless cave. A slight glisting of metal appears as you approach a peice of torn machinary. Traveling depper, you find the entrence to an old advanced shelter of somekind. After exploring somemore, you return to this enterence spot. A flash of lighting lights up the place again and you find a giant insect mantis like creature staring right at you. In a hurry you fire your beam at it and destroy it. An ear-wrentching cry echoes the halls as you see there are tons more of them, crawling on the walls jumping down from the ceilings, surrounding you. In a hurry, you attack them one by one and run to the cave enterence of the place. Suddenly, it lights up with life. Giant crab like insects start crawling down the walls, trilobites flee as the abondoned bunker becomes housed again, lights flicker on and off and motion is constantly seen throught this once desolate and quiet place. Only not one human or freindly creature is moving. Thats basically the opening sequence of Super Metroid. Constantly through this game will be intense and sometimes freighting moments of suspence. There is also always very satisfying action to follow. You play as Samus Aran, who has really cool sumersaulting jumping techniques. Also, she can shoot something right at a pin of a target while sumersaulting through the air ten yards away. Shes a really cool character with a really cool suit and a really cool arsenal of firepower to go with it all. Plus, a really cool game. Most of the game will be taken up exploring places, finding new abilitys/weapons in those places, and using those abilitys to gain acces to and explore other places. Most of these enviroments are dark, suspensefull, and gloomy like the one described above. The game also features some inovative enemys that can be destroyed challengly and satisfyingly no matter how you fight them. It has some really great graphics, too. But, the one con, and its a big one to, is that after watching the opening cutscenes, theres almost no story left. You'll alot of times be wondering if you're supposed to be in an area or not supposed to be there, with no real knowlege of where to go or what to do next. Just little hints like you've accomplished a big task in an area and feel that the next big task is in another big area. Other than that, this game is a really great classic and should be played by all at least once. It really almost plays identically to Metroid: Fusion, so a learning curve would be very small since alot of people have probably played fusion by now.
Graphics state-of-the-art for its time
Why would I say that then? Nostalgia, I guess. To me, it's what Tetris is supposed to look like. This is the first title available for the GameBoy, but could the graphics have really been any better? The blocks are very detailed and have a great style to them. The entire game looks great on the original GameBoy's green screen. It's a style that you won't find available in any game today, and looking at it with modern eyes, the game comes across as very unique.
If you liked this game check out all of the other star wars games.
What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game.

And as much as I love the N64 system I will say the best Sound audio and the graphics quality are inferior compared to the PlayStation version despite that the fact that it's crappy on Graphics in audio I will say there are a little extra things they have made to this game also changes for example the combination lock is a different digit number and also you will find a couple extra diary files that were not in the PlayStation version and because of those changes I decided to actually pick this game up because I love Resident Evil 2 as well and it happens to be one of my favorites equals out of the franchise.

The first time round, I'd seen this games flaws. It DOES have a difficult to master interface. Its missions are VERY difficult to play - especially those set in the Garden of Kadesh nebula (missions 7 - 9). The big difference is that there are many sure-fire strategies posted on the internet that can assist you in getting past the more difficult missions.

6272	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Planescape: Torment is one of the best Role-Playing games ever written. The writing talent and imagination that went into the game are impressive, equalled by no other game I've played with the possible exception of the classic masterpiece Star Control 2. The Planescape universe is one of the most compelling and interesting I've seen, and the game's playable characters are all distinct, well-developed, sympathetic, and memorable. The game begins with the protagonist, the Nameless One, waking up on a cold stone slab in a mortuary, his memory gone and his body covered in scars and tattoos, his senses assaulted by the smell of formaldehyde and rotting flesh coming from the nearby corpses and the zombies that are working on them. This is a dark beginning, and the game remains dark throughout, which is unappealing to some and is probably responsible for this game's relatively poor sales compared to inferior but lighter games such as Baldur's Gate. (While Torment is a dark game, it does not require you to be evil or immoral--the darkness comes from the game's exploration of tragedy. One of its central questions is "what can change the nature of a man?" Its mood is similar, but not the same as, that of the Fallout games.) The equation is simple--if you're a lover of fiction who is not turned off by darkness, you will almost certainly love Planescape: Torment.

When I first played the game, my reaction was the same as that of many others who have posted their reviews - the interface was difficult to master, the missions were too difficult. Eventually, I gave up and put Homeworld back onto the shelf. It's now 2001, and Homeworld has built up a huge following on the internet. So I re-installed the game on my computer...and got a major surprise.

The replay value is so incredibly high it never seems to get old.  The graphics maybe out dated but the play control is excellent.  The music is very good and the stages are excellent each with its own unique features.  Once you learn the freeze sequence you can tee off on the competition.  The game is great as a single player and even more fun with multiple people.  The intro and endings are fantastic very well done.  TM2 improves on the first game in every way.

Once you peel away the South Park appeal, there is very little left to stand on its own. I endured playing this for maybe 20 minutes before shutting it off out of extreme boredom. I can see why nobody ever talks about this game. Let's leave it that way.

Overall, a CLASSIC game that every strategy game enthusiast needs to play or own at one stage.
I looked up reviews for this game and I was surprised to see it blasted by many reviewers. They claimed it was too easy or too hard and painfully awkward to control. That is not the case. It is actually a very smart game that teaches you how to play in the first level without a single word of dialog or a single segment of text.
Any poor bastard that was unfortunate enough that played this atrocious, inhumane, intolerable game, with a brain stem knows, this game couldn't be given away.
But I don't love this.
Final Rating: 3.8/5
There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.
Pokemon is a classic.  It'll always be a classic.  No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable.  If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today.  Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.

The challenge is excellent (which means "just right").  One of the hardest Mario games to date- you will be playing this game for a long, long time.  Trust me, you'll WANT to dig in and replay this bad boy over and over because of the amount of fun it offers.  The challenge isn't in reaching the end of the level.  It's in trying to get a score of 100% in every level.
9227	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have had this game for a while, but declined to play it because it did not have any on-line gaming available and with the release of games such as RTCW, MOHAA, and C&C:Renegade, i had played those first and done the on-line thing. So I finally loaded this one up and WOW! The beginning cutscene was amazing. Alot of the game storytelling is done in comic book format and you have the ability to either watch it again or fast forward through it.

This  game adds features that: makes the game easier to manage (especially in  later stages), add depth to some of the options (i.e. government types) and  overall enhances the game play.

Final Fantasy VI has got to be the best in the series when it comes to characters, catchy music, and storyline.  The characters are all different and have their own personalities that make the game very unique.  The characters are developed very well, and you find yourself caring about their feelings, and what happens to them.  Beat the game, and then listen to the soundtrack, and I can gurantee that you will remember exactley where you were in the game when you first heard the songs.  The storyline is very traditional (good vs. bad no gray area), but it is a very well developed storyline with a few twists and turns, and to top it all off the bad guy in the game (Kefka) is the most evil and twisted villan in all of the Final Fantasy Series.
8808	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Rare proved to be a worthy asset to Nintendo during the 90's and surprised everyone by bringing out the hit arcade game, Killer Instinct in 1994. It was an excellent alternative to the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games that dominated the arcade scene. While it did not have as many characters or stages as other fighting games, it made up for it with stunning graphics, excellent music, a roster of good characters and deep gameplay that made you want to master each character. Then in 1995, Rare released Killer Instinct for the SNES shocking and surprising gamers at the same time. And it was so close to the source material that it was such a marvelous achievement from Rare and Nintendo.
So, I played it for three hours and then gave up.  I had an entire row of PS2 generation RPSs to suck up my attention, such as FFX and its sequel.  Which might not have the same old grueling fight system, but I can actually tell that Yuna is a girl, not a green dot with brown lines on her head.

5757	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	There are few series I consider to even be on the same level as the twelve official games in the Final Fantasy legacy, and of those I consider chapter eight to be the undeniable pinnacle. Which, considering its predecessor, the nearly omnipotent fanboy wet dream that was FFVII, says one hell of a lot. This title had every reason to underwhelm, from the groundbreaking success that preceded it (and the enormous shadow of expectations it had cast) to the wildly different path it chose to tread in terms of storyline themes and visual direction... yet it succeeds all the same.
THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular "grab the golden item to proceed to more levels" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you "power-walking" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.
Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.
So, I was not sure whether or not I'd like Duke Nukem Zero Hour or not. These days the N64 is not mainstream gaming; so video stores & etc don't even have 64 games to rent anymore. I never ever saw any Duke Nukem games for rental anywhere. But anyway, I took a deep breath and bought Duke Nukem Zero Hour second hand from a Video Game store and took it home to play with low expectations. I just knew I was not going to like this, it was over hyped or it would be another one where I thought, "what does anyone see in this?"
8785	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I'm not sure where to begin with this game...  Well, first of all, the story is highly original and quite interesting.  I like the fact that the game is based on a future Earth, with real places from history as its dungeons.  Wonderful idea.  The graphics are pretty standard SNES fare, with a slight combination of Zelda and Chrono Trigger.  Some of the music is excellent and very moving too.  I especially like the little world map tune, the mysterious flute tune that plays at the Inca ruins, and, most of all, that song that plays when you save the game and choose to quit for now (I wish I knew the names of these songs, they're great).
 Despite the graphics (come on ,this game didn't come out yesterday;) Clock tower is pretty challenging and innovative in the horror games department.
Everything depends on your Guardian Forces, which you must properly junction in accordance to the complex Junction System. Obviously the system would be much more of a joy to learn if not for the fascinatingly confusing manual. Luckily, there are numerous in-game tutorials that are far more helpful.
Oh, and Donkey Kong doesn't slap the ground anymore.  That's slightly disappointing because I used to like slapping bananas out of the dirt.
6409	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To keep things brief, if you liked the first you'll like this one.  It keeps the tried and true formula from Age of Empires and transitions it over into a great sequel.  This game is very easy to pick up and play if you take a few minutes to learn the trades of the game.

5918	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Final Fantasy VIII is by far the most innovative RPG I have played in a long while. So many new idea, where to start...<P... The battle system is Active Time: each character has a meter in battle; the meter fills up faster or slower, depending on the character's speed; when it reaches the top, the character can select his action. But here's the catch: enemies also attack according to their speed, and the meters do not stop while you're selecting what to do - you WILL get attacked while digging around in the menus. AS you can imagine, this adds a certain element of excitement to battles.
This is one of the closest games I've come across that's very similar to a true D&D campaign.  The negatives that some users might walk away with is that it really is only a single player game, so you can't join forces over the net like you can in games like Diablo.  Also you're limited to being the Nameless One and once his story line is over, it's pretty much done.  However, the ability to play in different classes throughout the game sort of makes up for this factor.  It was honestly a small negative for me because I tend to play through games only once then start a new and totally different game.  There are only a few games that I will play multiple times over and over.

35	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.

A very enjoyable game if you like older rpg's.  An asset to the FF series.
5981	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I Admit i never played the first Diablo but that was only because i had a low end PC and it couldn't support it, and by the time i did upgrade it, it was two years after and my graphics card couldn't handle the old game. So once Diablo 2 hit the shelves i decided not to miss the chance this time. And am i glad i didn't this game rocks! First off the character choices are pretty diverse, each of the characters has his or her own special ability which means you don't get the same powers in all the characters. My favorite is the necromancer because he can bring back the dead and summon other creatures from the earth. There are about five classes to choose from and each one of them has a set of magic or physical powers which you can upgrade as you gain experiance from killing monsters and collecting items.  The graphics, although i never actually played the first diablo, are a major improvement. The lightening and rain effects give the game some major atmosphere, and the music is great as well especially in the first level in the caves it has a sort of white zombie tone to it. Overall i can't think of one bad thing about this game single player wise. Multiplayer, though, is a different story. I tried the server a couple times and at the start of the game i would get booted for no apparent reason not mention all the players usually frag me no questions asked! This got very annoying and to tell you the truth it didn't interest me that much anyway. So i just stuck with the single player. It's still plenty of fun and extremely challenging.
I'm just gonna make this short and sweet for you...


 Just because it has `Star Trek'  tacked on to it does not automatically make it good: Remember Star Trek  Voyager? Maybe my standards are too high or maybe I shouldn't feel ripped  off for spending $... and having the pervasive sense of not getting my  money's worth.
The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle.
4122	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I grew up playing this game.  Blizzard does an amazing job at creating memorable games and this is no exception at all.  Star Craft is a true gaming classic and great.  It is a Real Time Strategy game, meaning that you don't take turns like you would in RISK but you have to manage your forces and be ready for the enemy forces at any time.  The game puts the Terran vs the Protos, vs the Zerg.  Each of the 3 races are 100% different and unique in their play style.  If you haven't played this before... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??
2614	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is a system for the 1990s (as I am sure you know) and is very old school. It is a great system for hand held play, especially if you are into older games.

The whole new scenario to the game is off the chart.  It's friken sweet.
Let's hope Kane bites the dust soon, before the C&C series turns as twisted as "The Forgotten".
The range and spectrum of stats/attributes on items is enormous.

Like I say those are just my personal takes on what else I would have liked in this this game.  I know it's been about ten years since this game first came out, and seeing as how the whole franchise seems to have been put permanently on hiatus, the possibility of this series being revived are slim and none.  Too bad, because it deserves better.
Unreal Tournament is sophomoric, with its obnoxious taunts and zero gravity jumps.  Reminds me of how people used to complain about Virtua Fighter jumps before they toned it down in 3.  The character models are rigid and identical in size and shape.  It simply doesn't have the same freedom in character models.  It feels like a shareware game.  The multiplayer server is a joke.  It takes me about a minute or longer (usually about 4 minutes) to get into a game.  With Quake, it's click click, I'm in.

The company who released this video game was just trying to "update" the game in which didn't needed to be updated.  bad job over all
You also get plenty of stages on a map screen you can play again as many times as you want. In fact you probably should play them more than once just to get the illusive yellow gems if you didn't get them the first time.

It's better to agree to disagree here.  Okay, let us begin with the review.  I love this game.  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.

That evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves. They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach.

Pros:
5280	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This not only the most unique blend of graphics I have ever seen, but the graphics are some of the best I have seen on the Playstation, period. Mixing anime characters that walk around in real-time environments is excellent. But these surroundings aren't just any real-time, they are actually CG quality running environments. So what you actually have is an anime designed character (with facial expressions), exploring in a CG environment. Now that the basics have been stated, let's talk about the special effects. What a Sci-Fi adventure title like this needs is some kick ass looking effects, luckily Kronos knows that as well. The job they did not only with the basic visuals but with the special effects is wonderful, explosions look great. In-fact if you ask me, things like fire, explosions, lighting and all of the other effects, seem as if they had a lot of time put into them just to make them look believable. If you are interested in knowing the process of how the backgrounds were generated here it is: Kronos started out with super detailed 2D sketches, then they render them into 3D and under low-resolution. Later final touches are made and then they are set to run under hi-res for the final version the game. Before I leave of to the gameplay, I want to mention a quick thing: For those who care, Fear Effect has over 600 backgrounds, and I'm guessing that that is the most any game has had.
Music: the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage. In short Super Mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect.

8361	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	RTS games did not exist when X-COM was released (or least I have never heard of one from that era) and good stratagey games were even harder to find (I could be corrected by a MOOR fan). When it was released, X-COM became the reason I invested so much in video gamming. The computer AI was nothing special, but the other little touches like surprise fire from windows and "Fog of War" (to name only a few) overcame the AI's weakness and forced you think about who to put with who and where on every mission. Fire teams, fire teams, fire teams. If you want to live through a mission, deploy in fire teams of no less than two with mixed weapons and always have someone under good cover, ready replace fallen members. If you just can't get out of the 80's and 90's when it comes to video games, and you long for those old, great strategey games, then this one for you.

2848	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I read alots of review about this game,alot of people said that Ape Escape was good,so I decided to buy Ape Escape for myself. Geez they were right,this game is great and fun. This is a fun game I mean I have to catch those monkey on different level and sometime each land have 4 or 6 or over 10 that each of the land that the monkey stay. There about 8 weapon/gaget that I can use to kill the enamy and to help me out on some hard place to reach. This game have 25 level and 200 monkey to catch,this game can be play for everyone,"like the esrb rated said on the front".Ape Escape is mild animated violence,there no gore or bad word on it "just wanted the parents to know it".I never get tired of playing Ape Escape,this is a really fun to catch the monkey. Get this game you won't be dissappointed,I haven't too!
8113	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The people at Raven did an excellent job with this game. It utilizes the Quake III engine, thus the graphics are superb. It offers both a single player, story line, gaming experience (which Quake III is lacking) and a Deathmatch/tournament, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game play like Quake III. It is like having two games in one, and as a matter of fact, the game puts two icons on your desktop to separate the two types of games. As mod/map/model makers get geared up on this title, there should be some very interesting things you can add to the basic version. In fact, there are a handfull of new maps already available. Moreover, there are many internet servers running this game so you can indulge in internet play. The weapons are pretty cool, each has a secondary fire mode, but too many are difficult to use well in the heat of the fire fight, and require you to be on target. Not enough of the weapons cause collateral damage.  I actually like this title better than Quake III.
So how would I rate this game, well I think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time. For that this game gets a 10/10 stars from me, music, gameplay, and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as I said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast.

However this acrobatic approach to Aladdin makes for some very interesting level design and this is the aspect that draws you into the game and makes you continue playing it. My favorite level in this game is the Cave of Wonders before Abu takes the gem from the Idol. You get to swing from spires hanging over pits of spikes, ride on logs travelling across a river, and pounce on bats flying high over gorges. It's just plain fun to try and get though this level.
In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.

The gameplay is somewhat basic. You can run, jump, Rev Roll (Like Sonic 2's spin dash move), and throw the Pac-Dots you eat to create small explosions. Fortunately, it actually makes for a very fun time, especially as you progress through the levels. There are lots of tweaks in each level, filling things up with neat detail and differentiation. It could be a little hard to judge distance for where you would land after jumping, but you'll get used to it quickly.

Clunky controls work pretty well and not really a con, 1st person games back then were all ways a little clunky.

The first level turns out to be amazingly hard with enemies running around EVERYWHERE and almost no medi-packs at your  disposal. The solution? Call a friend and beat the game in two-player mode.  It turns out that it's a really, really fun game! Kneeling and laying on  your stomach become your best friend when dodging enemy fire. Learning to  search around the area and sneaking up on soldiers shows that medi-packs  are equaly spread throughout levels. Choose your men wisely, as some  missions need someone that can use a scope to take out those irresistible  mines. The graphics, sound, and game mechanics are really great for only [the price]. The only drawback I have is that when you're calling your buddy to  follow you, he can get hung up on things like trees or cliffs -and- the  game could go much smoother without mines on every inch of ground. Overall,  your ... bucks couldn't go to better use. Nothing feels better than seeing  an Iraqi through your scope, or watching the little red sights appear on a  Viet-Kong.

  Storyline 10/10 The storyline is really great. Especially how the story fits with the gameplay.
Why are they "Great"?  They're real puzzle games.  Not that there's always one solution, or a right or wrong way to do things, but it is a game that focuses on technique, creative thinking, finesse, and (sometimes) quick reflexes.  There is no life bar; the game doesn't focus on that, or combat, it focuses on simply being able to figure out a solution and being able to execute it.  And it's fun, not boring and repetitive, but also very challenging.  And you have unlimited lives, which makes for playing with friends a lot of fun as you can pass around the controller to see who has the best ideas and skills.  It is as much fun to watch as it is to play.
 Silent Hill as you already know is the foundation for the series. Staring Harry Mason a man who will go to any lengths to fins his daughter as she is the only family he has left. You really have to play this game to get a sense of just how well developed the story is. This is something that could easily have been a movie (and not that sorry POS Silent Hill movie they made). As you play the game you get a real sense of desperation of a father that cares for his daughter and will go to any length to get her back. Even if it means traveling through Hell itself AKA the town of Silent Hill.

Sound wise, the developers really knew what they were doing with the Genesis sound module. There are some really memorable tunes here, ranging from dark bell tones to almost a synth-pop sound in some level themes, and there are some great nods to Elfman's score here. This is easily one of my favorite soundtracks on the Genesis and it helps Batman Returns stand out. The bass sounds full, the treble melodies aren't grating and don't sound as tinny as other Genesis games, and most, if not all, of the soundtrack is memorable. This is really, really great stuff.
Sooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters. I think it's supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit.

Everything about this game is brilliant - the campaigns are great, the random map is cool but my absolute favourite part of the game is the death match - I LOVE how you get 10,000 wood, gold, stone and food, it means you don't need to gather supplies you just can get right into building up your army.

FF 5 was also a great game.  While it lacked the in-depth characters and the complexity of the next FF, it does excel in all those areas nevertheless.  Plus this game has Gilgamesh.  It's worth playing just to see Gilgamesh.
#1.  Extremely long  fights:  Most of the weapons in this game are frustratingly innacurate and  don't do much damage.  As a result, fights go on and on and on and on and  on and . . well, you get the idea.  In X-Com and Shadow Watch, fire fights  tend to be relatively quick and decisive.  If a bad guy steps out in front  of you without cover, he goes down.  In this game though, he can stand  right in front of you at a range of three or four spaces and it will still  take a few turns to kill him.  You shoot and miss, and shoot and miss and  so on.  And then when you finally do hit the guy, it takes five or six  shots to take him down. Your mouse hand will get sore from all the point  and clicking. Both the accuracy and the lethality of all the weapons in the  game should be about doubled or trippled, which would lead to shorter, more  decisive engagements. 2.  Computer controlled characters have a huge  advantage in accuracy:  This is a weird glitch that becomes really obvious  from about the second fight onwards.  All computer controlled units are  roughly two to three times as accurate as your (supposedly elite) mercenary  units.  What does this mean? A couple of examples: a.)  One of your  mercenaries (with a high accuracy rating) is lying on the ground, firing at  an opponent lying on the ground, with no intervening cover.  The computer  controlled character will hit you about four times for every time you hit  him. b. You have a unit which has carfully positioned itself crouching  behind a tree for cover, shooting at a computer unit standing in the open.  You will hit each other with about the same frequency.
4520	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I would rent this game. It takes no skills what so ever to beat it. Maybe it just came naturally to me, or maybe I'm just to critical but this game is not worth buying. In my opinion this game would only appeal the the 8-11 age range and even then would they only play it once or twice.
It has a charm, a wit, and a pleasant, thoughtful presence that appeals to a wide number of people of all ages and with different styles.. Sure you find those "naughty" things you can do like run over people, smash into building, jam up the highways, and throw "patients" out of the helicopter... great emotional vents in those moments of frustration or boredom.. but the basic game somehow holds to a "gentler, kinder" essence.

5959	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	wow. i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games( which is clearly evident in games like, starcraft, warcraft, diablo)well i bought this game, and it was stupid. this is what i affectionately call a "clicker" game. you know, i left click on you,i hit you, i right clic on you, i do a magic thing. boring. they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing, but the fact that it'll always be the same thing, every time you play it, doesn't really give you much re-play value. also a killer is the mandatory quests,you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot. if you really want a real RPG, buy Baldur's Gate, it's cheaper, and you get to completely make your character, and there's a totally non-linear plot. do waht you want, or don't, but be prepared to suffer the consequences. Baldur's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control, while diablo 2, you are just kinda along for the ride. diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers, who don't really like the whole variable plot thing,the ones that don't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to, the ones who just want to click their way to victory. this game gets one star, which is many , many more than it deserves

Diablo II is incredibly addicting; you may sit down planning on playing an hour or two, and the first thing you know you've been fighting evil for four or five hours (and you still aren't ready to stop).  If you enjoy online gaming, the danger of obsession only grows.  Blizzard's free Battlenet online gaming service remains the standard by which all other online gaming services are judged.  Blizzard does everything the right way, and Diablo II is a shining example of their commitment to the thoughts and desires of the gaming community.  Twenty years from now, I will still be playing Diablo II.

Pros: Fair graphics, Great selection of ground vehicles, Great mission builder, Great AI, Awesome menu with elevator music, Awesome user interface

By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast. Personally, I don't consider that a flaw. I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons. Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game. Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count. There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with.

475	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is an amazing oringal game that I purely enjoyed playing. The storyline is so original for its time and its graphics are amazing on wide screen tv's. In the game, you are Lara Croft, a tomb raider and have been given another opportunity to explore more for artifacts in Peru by Jacalene Natla, a millionaire investor who holds a dark secret. You soon realize she is not what she claims and you do undercover research and she betrays you. You travel thru the dark cold and abandoned caves of peru, ancient underground Greece, the catacombs of Egypt & Atlantis all to find 3 pieces of the scion for which Natla asked her to get, all while blasting out animals and creatures you wouldn't expect and collect secrets along the way. This is a great game that had a greater sequal. But this is my favorite out of the series. Original playstion graphics, great music and sound affects and great storyline!
So why am I bashing the game so hard?  Because you get fewer fighters, fewer levels, HORRIBLE black and white graphics, and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate.  The blood doesn't even exist.  Okay there's blood, but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen, would you even call that blood?  No, you wouldn't (and shouldn't).
The game was met with great success and spouted off several sequels, but for some reason it doesn't really have a presence beyond PS2. There were hopes, and rumors, that Crash was once again going to be the flagship game for PS4, but that wasn't the case.

At the age of 24, I still play this game and very much enjoy it.  I understand everything about the game and can build a park to all its strengths with ease.  Chris Sawyer is a genius, and this series is legendary.  While I did enjoy its sequels, the original Roller Coaster Tycoon will always be my favorite.

In two player mode, you can do handicap (fun), a team match (also fun) or just one on one (still fun). Let's not forget the amazing roster of fighters. My favorites have to be Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, and Dhalsim. If you have a Genesis, I highly recommend it-c'mon, it's better than the Nintendo version. Sure it's not as good as Street Fighter 4, but it's still a fun bargain. As soon as I get the cables for my Genesis (I don't know what happened to my other cables) I'm going to start playing it again.
Gameplay elements and monkeys: Once again you catch monkeys, but its easier said than done. The first 3 levels are pretty easy, but by level 4 you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game. The task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down, like Man eating plants and annoying bees. I also have to mention that alot of monkeys are PACKING HEAT! Laser guns, bombs, machine gun, HOLLYCOW! Don't get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid. There are different kinds of monkeys. I'll just summarize what they do. Monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch. Monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get. Yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty. Green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement. White pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on (understatement. Impossible unless someone says other wise). Black pant monkeys carry oozies/machine guns. I have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games. Then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys. Good lord do my heart stop when I have to catch one of these little bastards. Catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as you've already guessed from my description of them, they are hard to catch. Throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that couldn't be caught before. Every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder, depending on the strategy used. The inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games. Some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless. You also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting 100 gold arrows or a jacket. I've had more game overs in this one then any of the other two.

The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.

As for the fighting part of the game, you get a total of three weapons, (Shotgun, handgun, and grenade gun) to exterminate raptors, pteradons, etc.  Some people might be turned off at the idea of only 3 weapons, but I don't find it a problem.  Combat is handled in the RE control scheme, which works pretty well.  As with a lot of survival horror games, you have to be carefull as to how you make your way through with ammo, which is not unlimited (Except in 1 case).  Fighting the dinosaurs can be difficult, but mastered.  Overall, I'd give the combat a B

The battle system is revised version of the first one.  For fans of Final Fantasy series may dismiss it as simple button masher, but the beauty of this system appears when you face the boss.  Since there aren't any overpowering summons, tactical thinking is critical.  You can take total control of one character and shift the battle in any way you like (I heavily use Rena for healing and protect Celine).

The puzzles have found that right balance of being challenging without making you rip your hair out trying to figure it out.  I've not looked at a cheat book yet and I'm pretty far into the game already.  Granted I don't have all the secrets on each level, but I'll go back and do that later.  The cinemas are done very nicely as well.  The game creates a lot of it's mood by suprising you with baddies popping out when you least expect it.  More than once I've been startled and hit the wrong key just to see Laura die.  But, with a smile on my face, I just start from my last save and have at it again.  And that's another thing you can save at any time you want.  BIG plus.

Story: I will not say to much about the story in Blood Omen Legacy Of Kain so I do not spoil it for anyone, but I will say that it is wonderful, extremely detailed and would make a good book or a movie. In a way the story is rather typical of a computer RPG. There are some magical pillars and some evil sorcerers that have corrupted them and it fall you you, you lucky bastard to defeat the sorcerers and bring back some artifacts to save the magical pillars and by that the world. Rather standard, but it is the story woven into this that is rather breathtaking. The characters are so good, and the voice talent of Simon Templeman just bring the tragic and powerful character of Kain to life. The story will suck you in.

4562	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Skateboarding is not a crime - but trying to top Tony Hawks Pro Skater in the Fun Factor rating will be. This fast paced thrill-a-minute skateboarding game will be the standard on the PlayStation for a while. It's one of the best games this year, and it's full slate of tricks, bails, and twists that will keep you satisfied for a while. Don't think that just because it's a skater game that you have to be a skater to play it. Tony Hawk lets the novice and the skate junkie alike enjoy the action. There's no complicated story line or rendered cut scenes in-between skating - you simply grind, gleam, and glide through ten different skate areas including classics like Burnside in Portland or the streets of San Francisco. You'll tear it up in abandoned warehouses, schools, and even in a river gorge in Phoenix. Pick from one of ten skaters, all with different moves and special tricks as you try to grab high scores, find hidden video tapes, and collect other items to help you reach your objectives. The game is a slick piece of work for the PlayStation. Although you will find the occasional seam split or blank polygonal dead-end, you'll be amazed by the detail in the game, including the full-on face bashing and asphalt blood-letting that hardcore skaters are used to. But what really seals this skate's fate is the game's incredible speed, which blazes past games like Trickstyle for the Dreamcast. The compliment of special moves is also spectacular, with a level of variation that makes almost any gravity-defying trick possible. A good skater would readily admit that the music attached to skate culture is a big part of the experience. Activision never slouched by giving lame, generic studio music to Tony Hawk fans - expect the thrash stylings of the Dead Kennedys, Primus, Goldfinger, and Suicidal Tendencies to round the soundtrack out. Don't like skate music? Turn it off and skate to Frank Sinatra to see what a difference a song makes. Although the game is styled so novices can easily figure out the controls, finger pimps will rule the roost in Tony Hawk. Some of the better combinations (and the higher scores) are achieved by the most intense finger aerobics since Track and Field. Mashing won't help either - you have to know the combos to score. All in all, Tony Hawk is an impressive tour-de-force in the skating arena. Competition like MTV Sports: Snowboarding, Trickstyle, and Thrasher: Skate and Destroy already have the bar set pretty high with this game. Who will bring the Hawk down? It's going to take a fairly high-flying predator to do the job.
Another thing about this game is that you  MUST pay attention to the story. I don't know how many times my brother  distracted me and I missed an important part of the story. And because the  plot is so complicated, going for a long time without playing is not  recommended because you tend to forget small things that end up becoming  big things later in the story.

This is a game I would have to recommend others to rent first (if you want to try it out). I personally love the game; however, I can see why many wouldn't like it. You either fall into the half the like the game or hate it.

This game is a puzzle game. The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature. The puzzle solutions can be illusive, but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious. Once you have solved puzzles once, they can generally be solved again quickly, allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again.
The campaigns on this  sequel are of a much hgiher caliber than those on the orignal, so  single-player use is very much improved.  In fact, the campaigns are  actually historically accurate, unlike those in AOE.  Indeed, the  historical section on the CD is fascinating reading in and of itself, and  will please those who love the time period, as well as the tactical  problems involved.
I loved this game from beginning to end and has become a new favorite of mine. If you enjoy any of the Mario games or even RPGs you will enjoy this game immensely.

*Capcom vs SNK 1 & 2- Nearly identical gameplay, but #2 has more characters and 3D backgrounds. #1 was also released on PSX and #2 was re-released on PS2 and GC.
Diablo 3 is coming out at some point (so many delays I dare not guess). If they can more or less take Diablo 2, juice the graphics, expand the breadth of monsters, levels, etc. but keep the core game play and concept is it was they'll have another winner. Sometimes simple is better.

This game consists of three game files you can choose to use. Also make sure the game has a game battery that works or you will not be able to save your progress once you access Candy's Save Point located closer to the end of the first world (Kongo Jungle). Futhermore, playing the game with a dead back up battery is no fun especially when you do not feel like playing it anymore for the day; and the next day you turn the Super Nintendo on and the progress that you worked hard for did not save like it should. On the other hand, the music is very catchy making you want to sing it while you are in the levels especially in the first level.

8895	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The tonel underpinnings of social commentary through out history makes this much more than a mere Super Nintendo game. The Gameplay is decent and solid. Not profound but competent. I have layed awake at nights thinking about this game's story. I truly find it amazing Nintendo produced something with this kind of depth. They address the moral ambiguities of life, social stratification, slavery, coping with loss, genocide, archeology, as well as good hearted adventure. When was the last time Donkey Kong had a comment on Social Oppresion? When did Mario deal with Historical Trauma? I would like to see more of this side of Nintendo. You know what the makers were going for when they created this game because they made the map to purposely resemble our earth. Not perfectly but close enough to realize the symbolism. They even referrence alot of earths archeology such as; the Nazca Plains, Pyramids, Easter Island, The Great Wall of China, and The tower of Babil, just to name a few.
Graphics-wise, 3000 is  beautiful! No two ways about it. A lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking, driving around in  individual cars, and so on. The building images are now fully 4-sided  entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each  feature. Five zoom levels let you choose the size you're comfortable with  to build on. Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom. I don't have that problem, but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are. They are merely enlargements  of the 4th zoom. Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoom.
The voice acting is legendary, the graphics just awesome and who can forget the live video at the beginning and ending of the game! (The girl who played Jill is absolutely beautiful.)
tion night-vision, and on three of your missions are in AREA 51!
The scenery is just splendid. The worlds are very different--one lush and green, one arid and dry, one partially submerged underwater (and in which the player enters one building and goes several floors down beneath the surface of the water outside). The player's progress is extremely linear--most things must be done in a particular order, and in some cases the player may be significantly hindered if she has missed some element. However, the ease with which the player may jump from world to world more than makes up for the linearity. Exploration is multidimensional in this regard.
The color of the background is alright and you get to hear people falling to there death after shooting them in the face the bad guy's not the good ones.

7410	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	There are evil forces in America that will try to sell you anything, and these evil forces understand the public's fascination with sports heroes and celebrities, and so take a sports hero and a video game and shouldn't that be a winning combination? Listen: this game is simply retarded. A basketball player does not a martial artist make. At first glance you might think this game is pretty cool; after all, the graphics are very well done and the animation is very fluid. But when you realize that you have a total of three moves--punch, kick, jump--and that you can defeat any evil kung fu master just by endlessly jump kicking across the screen and bouncing like a pogo stick, you realize this is not going to be a very deep fighting game. But, yeah, the graphics are pretty good so this game doesn't suck as bad as it possibly could. And then you remember that it's about a basketball hero who just happens to be a world-class martial artist, and that that martial artist is none other than Shaquille O'Neil. And you realize that you have too much free time on your hands, and that maybe you're playing this cart because you're really desperate to be entertained, and then you realize you were having more fun with Bimini Run, which you go back to. OK, to be fair, this game isn't nearly as bad as Bimini Run but it's still pretty ridiculous. Recommended only for those who enjoy a nice steaming pile of crap.
Overall score: 87/100
Minigames: This is one area where Square could've done better. They have many minigames but few of the games are fun like the snowboarding and motorcycle chase. The others were rather boring and got old really quick. The chocobo races were fun but chocobo breeding was time consuming and ultimately a pain to do. The Gold chocobo was random in breeding and you could end up reseting you playstation for over an hour trying to get it. I persisted and got mine but the reward was almost not worth the hours slaving over it. Just remember if you don't do it you never get to get the Knights of the Round materia, which is the most powerful summon in the game.
There is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.

What really influences the game other than the slingshot is Pac-Man's mood. This is interestingly an important part of the game, because how he acts toward some things rely on his behavior. Some instances require him to be angry or happy, and some cause him to change his mood to such things.

That said, put those fears to rest. Super Metroid is still the best side-scrolling Metroid game, and here's why.
8568	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is just so much fun. Each individual X-men has moves - actual MOVES - that they can use. This adds a layer of depth as you don't just feel like you're pushing the same buttons over and over. Brought to you by the minds behind Street Fighter, it basically feels like a fusion of a beat-em-up and a fighting game. The sprites were all well-designed, too. Definitely check this title out!
This game's story is very mild and shallow compared to the other RPGs mentioned above.  LSSS's strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles.  The story is a lightweight.  And definitely not for those looking for something along the lines of "epic".

"Myst" starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean.  You can hear water lapping along the dock, and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up.  And from there it only gets more interesting - you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one, more commonly called Ages; you encounter all sorts of devices that, even though they don't appear to do much, are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together; and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is "Myst."

I cannot stress how highly I reccomend this game.  It is 2012, and it is still listed as the greatest game of all time on every major site.  On Amazon, a new copy is currently selling for $700. It is far and away the best game ever made.  It is the best reason there is to still buy an N64.  If you still do not have this game, buy one now.  Even if you are part of the 0.01% who decides against it, you will easily make all your money back at resale.  But honestly, you will never sell it.

Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is. While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it. RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful. If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.

RE 2 is the second and perhaps most epic of the RE games.  Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield are likeable and active charactors who, with time and...well...more time, will grow on you.  The cast of secondary charactors and monsters are both creepy and delightful.  Best of all, the weapons are good enough to make Duke Nukem drool a little.  Pack this into a survival horror package, where one must carefully husband ammo and always be prepared and you have a game with a perfect mix of tension and action.

The Campaign in RB3D remains to this day the standard to which all others are held. Really, there is nothing else in the world of 3D flight sims that can compare to it. It is the key reason why so many have been flying and modding this sim over the years. Very little about the campaign is scripted. Once you take off from your aerodrome how events unfold from then on depends largely on the decisions you make while in the air. While flying a mission there is a real sense of a war going on all around you. Looking off into the distance dogfights and ground fire that have nothing to do with your mission can be seen unfolding. I have seen planes little more than specks in the distance spinning out of control towards the  earth, shot down out of the sky trailing smoke.
8395	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	The Good:
I run this game on a P3  450 with 96M RAM and only have slight glitches.  Dialogue is occasionaly  choppy, but gameplay is never interrupted.  I love the main character.  The  irony of a Crusader now being one of the damned is great.  Character  interaction is intersting, but a bit limited.
While on the subject of Deathrace mode, I also find it fairly shallow mechanically. There is only a  single map for this mode and the game really needed more maps and hazards for this kind of thing. Even in multiplayer once you get down to  just a few racers it can take forever to finish. It's fun for a little bit, but quickly loses it's luster once you realize how shallow and repetitive it is.

4786	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Is it possible for a game to be TOO realistic?  The graphics are excellent, and there's a lot of bass to everything.  Now, shall I go into the negative parts?  I'm against the claim that video games cause violence  in the populace, but this game nearly changed my opinion.  In Kingpin, it's  "f-this" and "f-that," and "Don't look at my  (expletive)."  Even casual talk has the F-word butting into the  conversation, and I was very disgusted with the conversations that my  character engaged in.  I returned the game soon after I installed it  because I thought the "gritty" subject matters detracted from the  "fun factor" of the game.  How can one have fun cussing and  killing other people that cuss back?  Sure, Quake and other games are  violent,  but not as wanton, gratuitous, and obscene as THIS game.  I admit  that I like some violence, but not even *I* would defend Kingpin from  accusations of youth violence.  Aside from that, bullets leave exit marks  on the opponents, but so does the crowbar, the levels are very confusing,  making you run in circles, and objectives are very vague.  Heed the rather  large warning labels on the box PLEASE.  This game is DEFINETELY NOT for  kids...and even some grown-ups!
You really have to say something about the graphics for this game. Even to this day, it's still probably one of the best looking SNES games in the library. The colors in the sprites and background graphics are very vibrant and really stick out at you. Everything is detailed as much as possible for a 16-bit game and there are virtually no graphical flaws anywhere. What's more is that you hardly come across any situations in the game where there are too many sprites on the screen at a time and the game starts to lag and sprites start to "shiver" as I call it (where half of Mario's head would be somewhat transparent and try to come out fully drawn).
The short of it:  Intimidatingly complex junction system gives way to a joyously refined magic and battle system once you get passed the learning curve.  The graphics are great for the PSX (PSone for you noobs), the story is a little weak, the characters are worthwhile and the sheer amount of things to do in the game is great.  To all of those used-to-be-16's who formerly hated this game: give it another shot, it may not be as good as FFVII or Xenogears, but it's definitely a worthwhile adventure.  It's certainly better than 90% of the RPG's available for the current generation of consoles.
My final thought is that is very interesting, very fun, but I would not recommend you to buy this for children under the ages of 8.
After a good 30 minutes with the game, I think the controls are almost perfect.  I have no problem at all controlling the game.  Furthermore, the framerate is lightning fast and incredibly smooth.  How many games with a SMOOTH and near-perfect framerate can you find on your Playstation?  Okay, there's Medal of Honor and tons of third-person shooters (like the Resident Evil series) in addition to lots of 2D adventure games (such as Mega Man X4 and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night).
The PROS: For its time, Extreme G's graphics and sound effects were top notch and showed what the N64 can do. The audio tracks are a real treat as it's a mix of house/techno music that get you pumped as you battle it out. The controls are pretty easy to pick up and are customizable so if you don't like the default setup, you can change it to your liking. Playing on own is fun but bring in 3 friends and you can look forward to good times. If you have a memory pack , the game will prompt you to save your progress and race times. If not, you will have to write down passwords so you don't have to re-do your progress. As a added treat, you can use your Rumble Pak and feel the force feedback from the rumblings of your bike to firing (and getting hit by) weapons.

I would really recommend this one only to die-hard Diablo fans. Those without it are not missing out on anything. Sierra tried to pull it off but they just couldn't match that Blizzard standard set by the original game, and the new features aren't worth fighting the bugs and irritants brought on by this expansion.

Also, be sure to pick up the new Mega Man artbooks for the X series and the regular series.

Anyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.
I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that when it comes to first-person shooters, I am absolutely *horrible* at them.  Enemies seem to find a way to come out of nowhere ALL the time and cheap-shot me, and then, of course, I die very quickly.  With most games like this, you barely have enough time to react to their insane shooting rampage and learn the controls before it's quickly "game over".  With Medal of Honor I can FINALLY put those nightmare problems to rest.  I can actually complete about 50% of this game, which, by my standards, is a BIG pat on the back.  I never would have guessed understanding a game like this was possible (and be able to complete some levels) but it's true!  Here's why:

  As far as multi-player goes, it's incredible!  Ranging from a 1 Human vs. 7 Computers to any number of combinations via the Internet and Battle.net or modem, a multi-player game is never the same twice.

You like missions? Well in this game you get over 40 of them! I wish rainbow six would give you that many. These missions are part of two campaigns that form a certain story line or you can play them as "quick missions" in any order on your own. Many of those missions are also available in multiplayer so you can play coop with a buddy. The missions take place in a variety of weather conditions day and night and the challenge is being able to take out all the terrorists because that one guy you missed will take you out and remember one shot kills! Sure you can respawn but that just means starting the mission all over again from the beginning. That is the challenge in delta force the sheer number of combatants you need to take out and the large area in which they use. For example in one of my favorite missions there is a downed pilot hiding in this snowy wilderness. To fly him out safely you need to take out a camp containing at least 25 of the enemy and destroy three SAMs. Getting most of the terrorist scum is easy as you just take a position up top and start picking them off but it's hard to get them all and some are out where you can't see them easily. So patience is key because as soon as you leave your cover somebody will get you. It took me a while to complete that mission and twice i was 99% finished just having blown up the SAMs only to get sniped.

Final Fantasy VII centers on Cloud Strife.  A mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as AVALANCHE, who are taking on the Shinra Corporation, that is slowly draining the planet of its life.  The story all comes together by Cloud's mysterious past, a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters.  The story of Final Fantasy VII spans so much more than just an evil Corporation.  You'll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world.  Even compared to today, Final Fantasy VII is an RPG that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling.  Rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults (as the JRPG has been drowned out in in recent years), Final Fantasy VII puts you in the role of characters about something more.  If there were any criticism of the story, it would be that it's a lot to take in.  Some things never really come together in the end and you'll be left with a lot of burning questions.  Much of this, you can bet, is due to some of Final Fantasy VII's shoddy translation.  There were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to.  Another small criticism comes with its characters.  While they're memorable, they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression.  Once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters, the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again.  If it weren't for their stark personalities, funny quips and own charms, you might forget them.

I just love the storyline and the characters,even though Link, Ganondorf and Zelda have been in all of the Zelda games, but this game is the best.  The original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo was okay, but it felt like the game would NEVER end!  I recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an action-ready hero.  This is also one of Nintendo's classics.  Everything a fantasy story needs is right in this game.
As a stand-alone game it rocks. The radio channels are hilarious as ever and morbid sense of humor will no doubt appeal to most people. This game does not invoke violence in anyone at all so don't worry. When it was first released the slogan was "Study this game." With the word "study" blacked out. I guess this is because there was uproar over the first game. Man, if they thought that this was violent, they would certainly freak big-time over GTA3.

The flaws in this game are relative to the player. I find that the sheer volume of items you need to obtain, and all the side levels, can be unbelieveable. You spend more time looking for items than you do looking for reptiles. Much of your time is also dedicated to finding hidden levels, which adds a lot of replay value, but causes you to get stuck at certain points. For some, this is a definite plus, and I am not saying that it is a big downer, but sometimes you feel bogged down with things to do.

Challenge

In the thick of it all is the opportunity to meet an array of characters. Some you may allow to join you. Again you will need to manage and provide for these characters. Each with their own personality.... which brings me to my final point about this game. Something some of the RPG games even today  don't have... like Grand Theft Auto. Personality. Playing this game is like reading a book. YOu become heavily invested in the characters. There is so much tongue and cheek humour, so much history (by the time you play fallout 2). Im not talking about storyline, but the characters themselves. Current generation games seem not to go past stereotypical meet and greet characters who are more interested to give you your next objective (checkpoint). Its uncanny how right they got this game. Its unjust how wrong they were to abandon Fallout 3. Interplay went bankrupt and I believe the licence has been given to another software agency to pursue  Fallout 3. I have been waiting for the third one for 10 years now, every once in a while checking the computer games catelogues...

Its no "force unleashed" but it is what it is, lots of characters can be played from Luke, to Vader, to Han, to Chewbacca, to a Tuskin Raider lookin' thing named "Hoar".

It has all the best modes, Match Race<this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer>, 2 Player, Trick Attack, Time Attack,and Contest, this is one game that won't get tiring fast.

A disappointing effort from the people who have, in past times, produced some of the most innovative and interesting games.

You are in rayman's world now. Help him save the world before it is to late. In the game you will fine lums in cages in the world's help the lums escape. There are many lums. There are blue lums, lums that give you air. And there are red lums that give you heath and life. In the game you get to go in the pretty places and the darkness places in the game. Save the world form evil and darkness before the goodness is gone forever.
The graphics are great for a game from '98.  They are done in an organic, old style, with old videos showing events of  the times. You can build telegraph poles to speed station turnaround, hear  about recessions and regrowth of economies, issue bonds, attempt mergers.  The political climate even affects where rights are cheap or expensive to  buy. It's a lesson in history as well as a challenging mental  exercise!


And lastly, and this is the hardest and most important to achieve- 255 status of EVERY possible stat- Strength, Speed, Luck, Vitality, Spirit, and Magic....I've spent over 600 hours alone in the crashed Gelnika morphing enemies for the sources to max out my stats....and it is no easy task....you'll need to morph about 170 Unknown 1's for Power Sources PER CHARACTER, 210 Poodlers for Speed Sources PER CHARACTER, 230 Bad Rap's for Luck Sources PER CHARACTER, 170 Unknown 2's for Guard Sources PER CHARACTER, 180 Serpents for Mind Sources (the hardest one to obtain) PER CHARACTER, and 170 Unknown 3's for Magic Sources....PER CHARACTER. So in the end you're looking at morphing over 9,000 enemies....fun fun fun....but if you're dedicated (or insane, whatever you like) like me....it can be done.
so here is a little advise: BUY IT
Despite the crudeness factor, I love the graphics. The spell system is just right, and I don't mind all the monster bashing. The story kept me engaged each time I played, even knowing the outcome the second and third time around.

Yes, I was hating on Donkey Kong Land pretty hard and heavy during my original review, and I even reached a boiling point where I said I'd never touch the game again.
For anyone new to Crash, looking to try it out, don't let any of this put you off. These (the first 3) are fantastic games overall. They're among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time. Crash is truly a gaming icon and I hope some way, somehow, that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name Crash Bandicoot.
This game almost made me cry.  That's how beloved its characters are.  Sephiroth is the greatest villain of any game.  (One of my favorite moments in the game is when the heroes had to cross a swamp where a giant snake lived.  When they tried to fight the thing, it defeated all of them with ease, so the heroes had to ride across the swamp on steeds so they could outrun it instead of fighting it.  And on the other side of the swamp lies...the cut up corpse of the same kind of giant snake.  Sephiroth took it out single-handedly.)  Aeris is just a beautiful character, a pure-hearted girl raised in the slums but born with a special connection to the planet's life force.  And Cloud is the coolest of heroes.  He's noble, a little bit cocky, and kind of psychologically messed up with his repressed memories and all.  And when you find out the truth about his past...that just makes him cooler, in my opinion.
8397	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	To start off this review I'd like to say that this game will mostly only appeal to fans of Myth:the Fallen Lords and Myth II:SoulBlighter. But anyways, this RTS (real-time strategy)game isn't like StarCraft. You don't  pump out soldiers from a compound, you don't take huge groups of soldiers  and attack the front of the base carelessly and you certainly don't  "just attack". You start with a group of soldiers, choose who  fights in your epic battles, and then you strategicly place your units  across the battlefield. you then attack at the right time and pray to god  that your enemy hasn't noticed any movements in any sides of your  ambush. You get a wide variety of units. Most of them come straight out of  the movies, but considering there are 40 something units you'll get some  that are plain new. The story is pretty diverse and is a very good one, so  I won't spoil that for ya'. This game features state-of-the-art graphics in  beautiful full 3d worlds. Everything comes to life around you in the  battles. Sound is....well.....if you've seen the movies you know what the  sounda are "really" supposed to be like, therefor the game does  the sound well but if your new to Star Wars then you'll have a hard time  trying to find out why things sound like they do. Gameplay is what this  game is all about. It's downright fun. You command huge AT walkers and you  can just watch them trample the enemy while they retreat helplessly. You  can see infantry just storming outposts annihalating everything in their  way. Also the camera is fluid, not fixed. This is a game great fan for true  RTS fans!
7519	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Forget everything you have ever learned from anarcheous first person blood-bath games.  You will need a totally different strategy for this game because when you're dead ... well you're dead.  You can't just reappear and  keep playing.  One shot + one kill = Realism.  You will have your back  against the wall, waiting to peek around the corner without making too much  noise.  Your heart will race and the adrenaline will flow as the dramatic  music heightens the suspense of who lies around the corner, or behind the  closed door ahead.  You will dim the lighting in your room and turn  everything else off so you can hear which direction the footsteps or the  gunshots are coming from.  You will be surprised, scared, shot from behind,  sniped, outnumbered or out-shot.  The replay value is extremely high  because of the online play, terrorist hunt, and lone wolf options.  Some  missions are nearly impossible on the highest difficulty setting which can  get very frustrating.  The online play is VERY addictive because getting  killed is more cause for revenge than getting fragged.  I would recommend  getting the expansion pack as well because of the custom mission option.  This option creates at least another month of replay value alone.  Can you  strike hard and quietly enough, without being seen and alerting the  hostages all at the same time?  It's up to you to find out!

I'll finish it soon and go through it again with the difficulty turned up.
5836	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I received original as a gift.  Great sound, gameplay, and fun.  Then when I installed this on it, gameplay wasn't that much enhanced. There no mode where its no worries about guests, ratings, or objectives, until you beat the game.  All it really did is add like 5 new rollercaoster, 2 trill rides, 2 shops, and 2 gentle rides (numbers may be off but thats an estimate).  and then it added around 30 new scenarios.  So its really a good game, but it could have added more themes and attractions.
I give An A+

First of all, the levels in Donkey Kong Land are NOT a direct ripoff of the ones in DKC.
If my 5 star rating was not enough, if you have never played this game or are looking for a fun trip down nostalgic lane, I strongly suggest playing this title.
Cons:

8028	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	For nostalgia purposes i was close to giving this a five star rating, but I'll be honest, as cool as this game is it does get a little monotonous. It is very Doom esque but doesn't really deliver on the action. There is action but once you get through it you find yourself getting lost and really trying to just get out of the levels...but with that said this game is pretty cool. The sewer level is annoying to navigate but is really cool inclusion especially for True star wars fans. The story is sick as well. So all in all I'd say this is well worth getting but i wouldn't expect to see significant differences in the levels as you play just different enemies and difficulties. But a must for any true star wars fan.
Graphics: At the time it was released Legacy Of Kain had mediocre graphics, they where ok, but not really great, the cut scenes are nice, and while the graphics are not fantastic, they do manage to capture the mood of the game and I think they do the job. The important thing in this game is the story, and the graphics are good enough, even if they are not exactly a selling point for the game.

This was the first FF to ever become 3D and for that it should be revolutionary alone but the best part is the storyline. The characters grow on you and there is a twist at the end (if I told you it wouldn't be a surprise) and all characters are individual even though some characters are barely used (does anyone put Cait Sith in their party?).

As I mentioned, Gunstar Heroes is a brilliantly crafted game.  It's crisp and clean looking, perhaps one of the best looking Genesis games out there.  You start off by choosing one of two characters, and one of four weapons.  You can either choose a character that lets you run while your shooting, or one that stands still and shoots.  They both have their advantages and disadvantages, such as you constantly running off a cliff if you decide not to choose the fixed character.  But if you choose the fixed character and the level scrolls... oh boy.  The game is also two player, and you're not restricted to just playing as one or the other.  You can both be the free-moving character if you want.
I don't know if i got this same exact kind but, LOVE it anyway!!!!
I still hope they do a remake of this game with updated graphics, that would make me very happy. Also, if you liked the story of FF7, you should play Crisis Core as its the story right before FF7 and explains ALOT about what happens in 7.
I really don't have any major complaints about this game. Even years later it's still fun.
Soundwise, it's not the biggest strength of the game, but it's still good. Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done - a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it, at least to a certain extent. And voices, while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs, suit the game well. It would've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters, but the limitations of the cartridge format doesn't help this area much.
The story line is change a little bit. Instead of the "Pamela Anderson" of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky "Meg Ryan" of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.
If you like  a game with a lot of action forget it.  If you like to feel like you  accomplished something, this is the game for you.
I must have played over 2000 games online, and have become skilled in the use of all three races. I must say, however, that I still come across several players whos skill dwarfs my own. It's always challenging to play online, because there are so many skillful players.
Speed Dash, Monkey swing,  kayak and quad bike help Lara out of tricky situations.
 Graphics are  second-to-none in quality, and go far beyond simply colored lighting.  Surreal's graphics engine incorporates some of the nicer elements such as  flowing waterfalls, fish, positional shadows based on light sources;  especially in instances where Rynn is carrying a flaming sword. Parents  wishing to purchase this game for younger players will be well advised that  this game is excessively violent in sword combat. The game allows you to  remove limbs, heads and parts of heads with frightening regularity,  complete with gushing spurts of blood and squishy sound effects. It is also  possible to lock out the excessive amounts of gore and password protect  it.

Even though the price was reduced, it was still fractionally more than I paid for Planescape: Torment, or for that matter, Baldur's Gate, each of which provided rich and stimulating entertainment for a couple of months.  I spent exactly a week getting to the end of Revenant, and since I'd been having such fun, I was totally unprepared for it.  Remember how disappointing the end of Diablo was?  Ditto for Revenant - the final encounter was quite easy for my impressively armoured, well-armed and richly provisioned character and the whole thing was quickly wrapped up in a movie sequence.  It left me feeling the story was only half told and that the developers just suddenly decided to get it to some sort of conclusion and out in the shops, while they got on with something else.  I wish they'd just gone on with the next chapter - despite any shortcomings mentioned above, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  This is the game to play when you're half concentrating on something else - in my case, LIVE coverage of the Sydney Olympics.
Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it.

1640	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a great stealth game and one of the first I ever played (besides Metal Gear Solid). I spent many hours on this just being sneaky. The main thing I liked about this is that it's not your typical run around hack and slash game. You actually had to think about what you're doing and what the outcome would be. The voice acting wasn't that great but it was at the time when this came out. I think most people's problem with this game (myself included) was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it, it wasn't that bad. Definately a classic game in my book.

This guy super cheat at the pirhan plant boss taking it down befor it grow to  about size of a full grown naudrey II maybe large. I think he used a push a button to drain energy cheat kind of like the drain boss health with vital which they had on the megaman collection cheats up until the cheats were created four number five or six than they did away with it. Here the really way to beat the Pirahan plant if I remember correctly it grows bigger tries to attack you there is like a sticker with like and X down near the bown of the plant near its root. You got to shot the egg of the wall and across the water at certain angel  you due it right it will hit and plant will flash I think about 2 - 10 time you have to repeat this process with out loosing baby mario. I higly recommend get the starts they increase counnt down time if you are hit so you can rescue baby mario before he is grabbed and taken away you have to repeat from last stage over again until you get through the whole stage with out baby mario getting capturing they also give you a higer point score for the stage you can use your points to by two items per area if you get a certain score.. I belive the max time he can stay of before being captured is about 30 second unless there is a cheat to increase that.  I am about 53/103 the way done with I am past the Pirhana plant the next ball is some kind of dust ball or something like that.  To defeat the this bost ground pound it six time each time it will break up into smalller dust ball after six time it is defeated you have three stage to go before the next boss.  The player is  about to enter the next boss castle. I am getting of in about 2 to 5  minutes  so I am going to fastfoward to the boss then I am going quick email my best friend. Which is a giant turtle.  Hit it with 4 egg and another four hits using those ground pund attack this boss goes down. I am about 59/103 of the way done due to fast forward about four minutes  plus about 2 minutes to watch the boss fight maybe less.  To beat the slug it it has 1/10 ressitance against  hit it ten times it will exploud.  I am now 65 minutes into this  due to 6 minutes of fastfowarding because I only had about 12 to 25 minutes to class started. To defeat the enlarged raven that you fight on the moon hit with three ground pound attack these will send sock waves through the moon or bring up some short of post that will hit it it has a weak 1/3 damage resitance do this move correctly three times it goes down.  75/103 about done with this will post other statistics later.  This boss has 0 percent resitance dfeat him the same way you defeated the first Koopa kids in super marion on. Break enough of  block with out you falling in the Lava will do in this giant porcupine like boss. I am now 84/103 done with this speed run the static will probably be posted withing the next 11 hour 58 minuntes maybe less.  I have three minutes to get to the next boss mninus ten to wait in the loby so I won't me marked trady.  The final boss fight with bowser  has 1/10 damaga resitancte ground pounbd three times when  kid bowser is small it will send a shock wavd due it correctly it will hit he will flash them his wizard maske him grow bibbger than hit him  with 7  bigger eggs froma distanc ehwild doging the flying builders the destroy the platform hit him 7 times there mwill be the explosion effected  he will shrink and take off them you free baby Lugio and the stork and congrulations you have just beat Super Mario world II Yooshi's island.

I love the materia system-it allows for some good customization, which I enjoyed.

As soon as you start playing the game, you'll realize that it is kind of a rebuilt Mortal Kombat. It has the same control scheme and the game is even made by Acclaim. It you like Mortal Kombat games, then this might be good news for you. Although it shares the controls with Mortal Kombat, there are, of course, new additions, such as the grappling hook and the Batarang. The grappling hook might take some getting used to.

This game is more or less what I said above: a charm. It does not have that same adventurous feel of the first Zelda game, because it tends to focus on the progress of the quest, more. It does a great job of this and you'll find that the instruction booklet is not needed. Everything is explained clearly and concisely in the game. The game of course, is traditional Zelda fare. A three-quarter overhead perspective and a vast land to explore. Find new items to get into areas which are otherwise out of reach etc. You get a plethora of items including a bunch of new toys like the hookshot, the three medallions and the two canes.

The box art and cutscenes might mislead unsuspecting players into thinking Vampire is an epic RPG or even a first-person adventure. It's neither. While the story, conversations, and character development are engaging, the game itself is an old-style isometric hack and slash. Which is fine, when that particular system is implemented competently. Here it only occasionally works. Too much of Vampire's environments consist of narrow hallways and blind corridors where enemies and allies alike jam themselves into environmental wedges, run headlong into adversaries, and generally act in manners directly against common sense. Level design is pretty, well detailed, and enhances the mood of the game, but it is amateurish in terms of interactivity. This would be a minor flaw if, again, the meat of the game weren't the combat itself. Yes, there are many RPG elements like character leveling and the often fun experiments with trinkets and baubles picked up at the local shops, but the fun bits devolve into frustration whenever a member of your crew runs headfirst into a gaggle of bloodsuckers, despite your commands.

Recently I had a strange inkling to revisit Perfect Dark so taking out my old N64 with thankfully my Expansion Pak from Donkey Kong's packaging, I thought I'd check it out and while I can nitpick it to death about "dated this and that", it still wouldn't mask that it was a great game through and through.

Anyway, just go get this game if you don't already own it. Or, pick up Mega Man X Collection for the 5th generation systems. It's a gem.
Overall I give Mario Smash Bros. 4 stars. I took off a star because after you obtain the 4 missing characters, the game is basically over. You can still battle with your friends, but like most games, it starts to get old after a while. I recommend it for ages 5 - 15.

Let's get one thing  straight.  Graphic-wise, this game mirrors the arcade perfectly.  That's  one smooth box of chips Sega's got.  The character models are back to the  3,000-polygon count (up from the PS and N64's dozen or so polygons per  fighter) and the colors are bright and vibrant, with no pixelization.  However, there's a few oddball things that stand out.  For example, for all  of its 22nd-century power, the Dreamcast can't deliver shadows that don't  look like bouncing boxes strung together?  I don't think so, Midway.  Plus,  you'll see several of the same animations again and again and  again.
WWF No Mercy (groundbreaking wrestling game of its time)
Streets of Rage 2 easily outshined the original Streets of Rage, but it was actually much better received than it's sequel Streets of Rage 3. In Streets of Rage 3, the challenge was upped a little too much and the game was much longer, plus the addition of the robot character and the change to the special move's system was just too much for gamers. Sadly, fans that loved Streets of Rage 2 were disappointed in Streets of Rage 3, and what they really wanted was a game that captured the same magic that Streets of Rage 2 did. Quite simply, it was not meant to be.

Overall, Legend of Zelda: OoT is probably one of the best RPGs available. Would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful gift!


The characters are hit-and-miss for most. Chris and Claire are spot on, along with a familiar face from a previous game. Steve can get a bit annoying, but by the time you get to the second disc, he'll either have grown on you, or you'll loathe his guts. The Ashfords, while annoying, have their parts done perfectly.
Overall the gameplay could be improved to allow endless expansion of cities and even MORE elemental customization of the maps if they're going to release an Age of Wonders III, but with the latest created in the PC gaming world, an Age of Wonders III wouldn't have that much to worry about.

That being said, if you only had cash to purchase one  of the two heavyweights, I would probably recommend this first.  Out of the  box it offers a more complete gaming experience over the competition with  more styles of gameplay and better bot support.
You use stealth instead of force in the game
2172	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I've been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset. And to be quite honest, playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be. Sure, the game is mildly entertaining, but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had, it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters. The character roster totals out at 17, with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel. There are five modes of play including battle, versus, training, hero battle, and crossover. Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes. Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters. Nothing special here. Crossover mode, however, is at least somewhat interesting. You see, in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight. This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but couldn't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. Sadly, the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason. Sure, you can still pick two characters, but you can only play as one of them. The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter. Crossover mode tries to bring the game's main selling point home. This mode allows you to pick two characters, then the computer uses the same characters you picked. This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four. If you are victorious in this battle, the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another. This is done so that you aren't playing with and against the same two characters each fight. It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade, but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak. Visually, MSH vs. SF looks good. But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart, it simply fails. The colors aren't nearly as vibrant, and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown. It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, though, because not nearly as much animation was cut out. This is a major plus, since frames of animation not only affect the game's appearance but timing and gameplay as well. On the gameplay side, Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay. But in the end, it's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode, and with the overall exclusion of this mode, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game.

Also in Claire's quest, Umbrella drops what looks like a bomb with legs in the police station and it turns out that they dropped another tyrant that bothers Claire through the game with the name Mr. X; putting Mr. X down only bought you time, nothing else. Most players decided not to play Claire's quest because of Mr. X...and yes I will admit that he could be a pain because very much like Nemesis in the third game, he came in the most uneasiest moments, except with this game, loading doors saved you...not so much in the third game.
The player takes on the role of New York detective Max Payne.  In the emotional opening chapter, a prologue to the action, we see through Max's eyes the murder of his wife and infant child.  Max finds hints that the murders were the work of a particular drug gang, and moves on to work with a drug enforcement agency for three years to find the leader. It plays out like a scene from a big-budget action movie.  This sets the up the rest of the first "act" of the game, with Max in search of the leader of the gang.

even though I found some stuff to be better in the original than TWIN SNAKES.  For example: The final conflict between Snake and Ninja/gray fox wasn't as sad as I thought it would be in twin snakes.

The many powerups and weapons add to the fun in this game.  Control is a little hard when you first start playing, but it is easy to get used to (The craft slide a bit when you are turning).  There are only 8 ships to choose from and some of them aren't very good.  More tracks wouldn't hurt either.  This game is a good game and you should buy it.
Bandicoot is a marsupial on a muey dangerouso quest to collect 25 crystals and 25 relics in a quest to stop Dr. Neo Cortex and Aku Akus evil twin Uka Uka's quest to take over the world.
There is strategy to it though. You can move back and forth, Slash, stab, chop, and swing upwards. This makes it fun, and not the same old, hit x, select a command, hit x, select a command, hit x... but "Ok, if I run up and do a stab I can hit the guys behind the bird too, then I can have Rutee do her Bloody Rose on the guy under me while I am in mid air, so once I hit a guy up into the air Rutee will continue the attack and destroy him." There are tons of things you can do to have fun. Sometimes trying to see how many chain special attacks you can pull off. Or mabye, you want to test out all the tons of magic spells you have. It is fun to mess around, and fun to use some strategy, rather than do the normal final fantasy select and click battle. As for magic, there are 6 swordians. You get quite a few. Like the hero gets Dymlos, Rutee gets Atwight, and so on(can't spoil it!). With these Swordians you can develop magic. But only if you have it equpied. I mean you will always learn new magic, but if you don't have the swordian equipped you can't cast any. Still, some characters don't get a swordian and rock. Like at the end of the game only 2 of my characters including the hero actually were using a swordian. I dropped 2 of my high level people because they were getting boring. Then I got this guy with a bow, and a bard. It was very fun to see all new attacks and strategys to use.

There is one thing that I did dislike about the game. That had to do with the exploration of the castl. Things are fine and dandy when you're finding new places to go and new enemies to fight, but eventually, you'll get stuck. And, inevitably, you'll be roaming the same halls over and over again until you discover that secret room, or new ability that will allow you to progress. While not gamebreaking, i did have to just stop playing because i was tired of making no progress, give it a while, and then go back to it with fresh eyes.

While the graphics are of a down fall, the games sets it self up to benefit the gamer.  The ability to be a master in every job signifintly makes it easier to beat the game.  Some jobs are better than others.  I prefer Monks, knights, and Lancers.  There are five chapters  to the game, and while you advance the story you will want to level up fast to hurry up and speed thrpugh the game to see its ending.  Even though you can not interact with the ending after the credits what happens will not surprise anybody at all.  The game should take about 40 hours of playing time and is pretty good compared to most of the games in the series.

There are eight vehicles for you to control, and each offer a different type of gameplay. Ramdozer (bulldozer) is the simplest, where you just ram things to destroy them; J-Bomb (giant robot) can fly with its jetpack and fall onto buildings to destroy them (think Mario's butt stomp in Super Mario 64), and six more gameplay styles. The graphics are pretty nice with clean models and colorful explosions. I personally liked the music, surprisingly good considering its genre (what is the genre?). The sound effects are of course good, though the explosions sound kind of cheesy. It is nice that the game has talking characters, I catch myself saying "Time to get moving!" after playing this game for a while, it's very contagious.

Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.

Could it be an addiction to shooting zombies over and over? That may be it, because, despite the fact that zombies walk slowly and predictably through each area of the game you explore, something about wanting to keep killing them *never* gets boring. Maybe it's hearing that "pop" sound from the handgun and watching a zombie bleed and take a step back to gather their brain dead thoughts that makes the game so memorable? These zombies are actually pretty animated when you consider the age this game was released (1997-1998). Sometimes you walk into a room and a zombie will be walking the other way, you shoot, and it will slowly turn around and come after you. This is pretty cool. It means they're not entirely stupid. They know when someone is trying to kill them again.

One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in "Super Mario World".

However, the gameplay... this, unfortunately, is what ruins it.  Now, there are some cool features here such as a free running mode which makes the game truly 3D like Bushido Blade (and unlike the pseudo 3D of Tekken, for instance).  There is also a limited guard meter (like Street Fighter Alpha 3), which prevents turtling.  Unfortunately though, these nice features are overshadowed by very serious flaws.  First of all, the are the motion-captured moves.  While they look great, they're also extremely jerky when translated to the game.  They are also plagued with horrible lag and recovery times.  Even a simple jab leaves you open for all sorts of counterattacks.  The other problem is the control: it flows like 3-year-old Heinz ketchup.  There is no hope of stringing any moves together because the game cancels out all additional button presses from the moment you start a move all the way until your character completely recovers at the end of the move.  This wouldn't be so bad, except for the previously mentioned problem: extremely slow recovery times.  In fact, the lag time for throwing a swing is longer than the recovery time from getting hit by one!  This means that you hit the opponent with your strongest move, and they recover from it before you do.

Super metroid has been called one of the... if not THE... most well designed game of all time.  The bosses were big and frightening.  the map was desgined with the powerups placed in just such a way that when you found one powerup... It gave you the ability too enter an previously unreachable area, There's a certain rewarding thrill behind playing a game with this design, and the developers are either fans of that design, are worked on super metroid themselves.

The plot is somewhat mature, but the 3rd person perspective makes is much less graphic than games like Quake or Doom. The NPCs are very entertaining, and offer a vast array of skills and dialogue (I like the fact that the PC can initiate dialogue themselves). I like that the character's actions defined his alignment, not vice verse. I didn't like the limitations put on the main character's appearance and sex(as a female, I like to play w/ female PCs), but I didn't mind that much. I also liked that the area-affect spells didn't damage party members (as they do in the BG series). However, the first part of the game was quite confusing, and I had a tough time navigating through all the sections of the slums, and remembering where everything was (the programmers did include a handy map-marking feature which helps though). I also wish that there had been some expansion of some aspects in the game (such as the mysterious "Lady of Pain"), but far be it from me to complain. Since it doesn't appear that Amazon has this game in stock at the moment, I suggest that you drive to the nearest software storm and buy this game!!
  Like Capcom's RE series there are puzzles to be solved in this game as well. Some can be so challenging that you will be forced to use a cheat or guide. FE is a pretty squeamish game, tons and tons of blood is squirted all over the place. Besides all of that you have a variety of weapons to choose from, Uzi's, .40 Pistols, Machine Guns, Hand Guns and more. The game spans 4 CD's but most of the space is used for the graphics quality, and the gameplay is hurt by a short replay value.
The bosses are challening, and the weapons are helpful to your quest. Whether it is your motion sensing mines, or your c-4, which you can plant almost anywhere (if you are really careful, you can even plant it on the back of guards, and detonate!), there are also many automatic, and semi-automatic to make the game more fun. You can blow away a bad guy with a missle launcher, or you can quietly sneak up and use your sniper rifle to take them out. Anyway you fight, this game is definately a fun and exciting adventure, a definate must!

With over 400 cars and actual real-life tracks, this game is as close to the real thing as you can get. This game focuses on the pressure to win. No jumps or shortcuts. Just pure racing, the way it should be. Keep in mind, this is not public street racing like SF Rush but thats the way real Gran turismo racing is. I like how you can upgrade your cars to be Crazy fast machines!! The driving is very realistic, and you really learn how to use oversteer and understeer to your advantage. The bottom line is...this game is the one everyone needs.

That's probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the N64.

If one wants to have lots of gunning and running action while shooting dinosaurs, then you'll certianlly get it while playing this game.  Going through each level pits you against literally hundreds of soliders and dinosaurs, so much so that at times it's easy to get overwhelmed.  Fortunitly, the game does include a desperatly needed checkpoint system (which was missing in the first genesis game).  This is the kind of game that you can play two ways.  You can run and try to survive to get to the end, or you can take your time and kill everything you come across, so you do get a bit of freedom when it comes to how you play.

I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.

Overall, don't waste any money on this. If you decide to buy this, pick up some pepto-bismo on your way back to the grocery store. Or just get an SNES or Arcade emulator if you want to play the real MK1.
Winback was a good game and I find it is still worth taking out my console and playing it. If you can overlook its flaws, you may very well end up enjoying the game as much as those who tried it.

Amazon is selling it brand new and for cheap so go ahead; it won't cost you much.

You start with different missions, you are given a land and are required to obtain a certain goal, mostly get a certain amount of people in your park, mantain a 600 Park Rating, by a certain time, such as by 4 years.  I find them all very easy done, and it is not very challenging.  However, it is all still EXTREMELY fun.  It is the satisfication of watching the roller coasters you built bloom and attract guests.  It is the satisfication of watching a boring chunk of land be a hit amusement park.  It is the satisfication of expanding your park to be bigger, and have more rides, and attract more and more people.  This is one of the best games out there, and I haven't checked out Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 yet, but this is my favorite game for my PC, and that's REALLY good because I genrally pefer action games.
Okay, it's dated. The graphics aren't sharp and the voice acting is sub par. Their mouths don't move and the characters look like they were made out of melted lego blocks. But Kids, this was an era where every other game was either side-scrolling or full of platforms. This game was a welcome change to the monotiny of racing games, platform games, and horror games that did not scare us anymore.
Nintendo added another interesting element to cement the legacy by allowing Bowser, Mario's traditional nemesis, to be a playable character. Bowser is personified in a comical fashion as he is continously trying to assert his dominance but always manages to come across as slightly light-hearted, as though Nintendo wanted fans of the Mario series to see that Bowser isn't a malicious beast. His interactions with Mario are pretty funny.

But the essence of "Diablo II" is very much in its practical side. Tinkering with your characters' stats and hunting for items dropped by the monsters is the main attraction. There are literally thousands of items in the game, from magical rings, to rare axes, to the golden unique items, all of which are there for you to play dress up with. Set items are the rarest of them all, and if the set is completed by finding all the pieces (e.g. Death's Hand Sash, Death's Hand Boots...) then you get a very nice bonus. The amount of different monsters you can slay is truly astounding. All kinds of evil critters and denizens of hell make an appearance here, from vicious giant vultures, to lurking sea snakes, and of course - zombies! And lots of zombies too, since this is very much a hack and slash game, you will be clicking and clicking as you trudge through the millions of minions the game throws at you. It does get tedious sometimes, which is the only real letdown of the game's design. There isn't really enough depth to the story to make up for the sheer amount of clicking you have to do. The variance in areas does help, as does the motivation to get better loot, but other than that, "Diablo II" is just a giant slashfest. The Bosses you face at the end of each Act do have to get special mention however. They are extremely challenging and very neat to go up against.

The 'thing' about FFVIII is, it strays away from what "RPG" has meant to most videogame RPG players over the last 15 or so years. It breaks many RPG traditions, even more than FFVII did. Meanwhile, many companies are still recycling the innovations made many years ago in previous FF games.

While the new rides, particularly the rollercoasters, are much more interesting and fun to work with, they don't have enough. When you consider that these are on their own CD, you would expect at least twice as many extras on it. There is enough to keep the park looking great, but there could have been more. The scenery themes in particular are very limited. I think that they have rushed it.
The game has 3 bosses, and the first two are simple. The last guy, however, is hard as hell. This is mainly because that by the time you get to him, your lives and health will be drained severely, so it will be a very big challenge for you.

Such inauspicious beginnings mark the first 20 minutes of the game, and while it might sound boring, it has a devious psychological purpose.

Cons: One thing that  I found sucky was Indy's aiming.  you do have a gun and you can shoot  spiders and german commies and stuff, but his aiming is SOOOOOOOo awful!

Where every previous chapter in the Final Fantasy story had basically opened with the lead characters already trained and experienced in their professions, FF8 is the first to tell the story of how these characters were first educated as super-soldiers, which natural reservations they had with their chosen role, and just how awkward their first steps as pros really were. In a way, this story is half Platoon and half Breakfast Club. The characters form a bond under extreme circumstances, both with each other and with the player, and develop into skilled fighters before they're even comfortable talking openly about their feelings.

6738	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Genesis was Sega's shining moment. Nobody thought anybody could top the "Big N" (Nintendo), but thanks to a game called "Mortal Kombat", the Genesis was suddenly wanted more than Nintendo's SNES. See, the reason is that Nintendo's "game quality policy" (I call it censorship) prohibited images like blood and graphic violence (read "Sub-Zero ripping out Johnny Cage's spine"), so MK on the SNES was censored (instead of blood, there was sweat, and the fatalities were toned down to the point they resembled the "Friendship" moves from MK2). Well, on the Genesis, thanks to the "DULLARD" code (hit down, up, left, left, A, right, down at the title screen of the Genesis version) you could play MK with the blood and real fatalities. However, there was more to Genesis than Mortal Kombat. Sonic The Hedgehog 1 and Sonic 2 are two of my most favorite titles. Streets Of Rage was considered one of the best side scrolling beat 'em up games ever (Streets Of Rage 2 is even better with awesome graphics), but what makes the Genesis shine IMHO is the Phantasy Star series, one of my most favorite RPG series (Final Fantasy being my most fave...long live Squaresoft). And Sega put some of their late 80s arcade games on Genesis, and they rocked (Shinobi, Altered Beast, Outrun, Golden Axe...they all ruled). The only drawbacks to the Genesis are the limited color pallate (both total and onscreen...it had a color pallate of 512 colors and could only display 64 colors at a time) and its sound chip and sound memory (SNES outdid the Genesis in both colors and sound), but Genesis games could have outstanding music (Yu Hasuko <sp> composed the absolutely fabulous music for the Streets Of Rage series...the music from the first Streets Of Rage game is so funky it might make you wanna get down with your bad self).

In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble.

This beautiful game retains everything good about its predecessor, Soul Blazer, but makes everything more complex and even more challenging. Instead of the traditional level-up system found in almost every single RPG to date, you will become stronger after defeating every single enemy in any area you are currently in. When you defeat every monster, a jewel appears from the last monster destroyed that permanently increases one of your stats by 1 point. You have three stats--HP, Strength, and Defense--that can all be boosted, and the max HP you can have is 40. Combat is fast, fluid, and always intense; just as it should be. Not only that, later on in the game, you will be given the freedom to change into two separate forms that will grant you an entirely different set of abilities and powers: Freedan, a dark knight, and Shadow, the ultimate warrior born from the light of the Comet. Each character will learn unique skills that allow them to access new and expansive areas, and sometimes, it is absolutely vital in order to move on with the game. Also, there are these secret items in the game called Red Jewels, and there are 50 of them scattered all across the world. Collecting them and bringing them to the Jeweler Gem, a master of disguise in every area you visit, will grant you items, power ups, and even access to a secret dungeon. No matter where you turn, there's never a dull moment.

The interface takes a short time to get familiar with, but  is very simple and easy to operate.  The graphics are great (could you use  this program to design a real rollercoaster?  Looks like it to me!), the  levels each have different goals and features.  I especially appreciated  all the different theme landscaping available, including Greek and Roman  architecture, Wonderland theming (giant chess pieces, candy, mushrooms,  etc), and Wild West props.  The rollercoasters are a blast to build, but  not simple to master.  After 20+ rollercoasters, I have yet to build the  perfect ride.
But here's the thing about this torture devise... it's entertaining to a certain degree. Now I may be crazy but I bought this just to say "I own one of the worst games in history" but I'm actually compelled to beat it to 100%.

This is the videogame equivalent of an Asylum movie.
Gameplay (4/10): Was the rotating camera really necessary? I've played games with rotating camera angles (like Xenogears) that worked just fine, but in this game it doesn't.  The problem lies in dungeon navigation. If the graphics had been better, or if there had been better dungeon design, perhaps navigation wouldn't be so confusing.  It's really hard to tell where you are because the dungeon design is so bland and repetitive; there are usually no landmarks with which to navigate, with the result that I actually wound up back at the entrance thinking it was the exit. On another note, something else that bothered me was the fact that even by the end of the game, you couldn't really return to much of anywhere you had been previously.  I kept expecting be able to return to Parm eventually, but no such luck.

8096	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Super Mario World took what made Mario 3 so fun and packed it with epic 16-bit action. While I thought it was rather simple, I soon corrected myself once I took a closer at the internal workings. First of all, the graphics are quite nice for the Super NES. Yeah, it is rather pixelated, but the cartoon style and wonderful effects make up for it. The also game is quite complicated for it's time. The 3-layer engine runs around 7 different tilesets each with diffrent scenery and enemies, and the complicated isometric map screen runs even more. To top that off, enemy generators and scrolling varations are almost always used. The heavy use of flags and scripts on the map screen make the game even more amazingly complex. However, even to people who aren't interested in Mario's internal engine design, Mario World is still every bit enjoyable. The levels come in all shapes and styles with creative enemies to match. Mario World introduced Yoshi, the dinosaur pal Mario can ride on and make eat enemies. Yoshi is vital to the game if you want to win it. Mario World also introduced many other memorable elements that make Mario the most awesome platformer around: Ghost Houses, Switch Palaces, Secret Exits, Star World, Bowser's Koopa Clown Car, Renzor, etc. Your not a real gamer until you've felt the magic of the world and suffered the burn of the challenges. If you think Nintendo is going to be soft and hold your hand like in New Super Mario Bros 2, your in for a big surprise. Nintendo was a completely different company back when the Super NES was launched, and Mario World is proof of that.

Once Sega established themselves as a worthy contender of the 16-bit era with the original Sonic The Hedgehog, they knew their newly successful mascot shouldn't be relegated to a "one-game-wonder" status, so they set out to follow it up with a sequel in order to keep the public's attention on them. Although Sonic was the true origin of the 16-bit wars between the giants Sega and Nintendo, this time Sega had a much greater challenge ahead of them. By 1992, the big N had just released their new SNES system along with a slew of outstanding games. Therefore Sega had to react fast. Sonic fast. They had to figure out how to draw people back to the ring collecting, speed shoes, chaos emeralds, and blue hedgehogs in a time when people were absorbed with Yoshis, Simon Belmonts, F-Zeros, and Street Fighters. Sega started work first on what would later become Sonic CD (for the Sega CD), but put it away briefly and made some other graphical upgrades to have a game ready for 1992. What resulted is Sonic 2. Did it live up to the original, or did the game fall under the inferior sequel curse? I'm sure you already know my answer...

Graphics - At the time of it's release, the SNES had just about enough and it was Nintendo 64's job to take over. Although the 64 was revolutionary, Mario RPG had one of the best looking games for the SNES. The very well done 3D and art style blended together so well.

In classic Final Fantasy style, the seventh game in the series brings Cloud, a mercenary now working for a terrorist group, into your head. As you play, you can really understand where the characters come from and what their real selves are like. It might sound weird, but this is truly an incredible game. A wonderful experience for anyone who likes this series, or anyone looking for an absolutely outstanding story.

8537	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is an arcade game for the megadrive which is on a cartridge which has six games to it, thus is one of them, I rememeber playing this with my brother ages ago I used to play as Adam and he was Axl or Blaze. There isn't many moves except punch, kick, throw, german suplex and weapon strike with various weapons. It was better ten years ago though before PS2 and whatnot. The levels are generally easy except the 5th one which I think is pretty hard, also the last one is because you have you fight all the bosses and then the main boss. Like I said before this was good back in the dayz, but is good for a play every now and then.

Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.

There's four varities of Metroids (in addition to the normal ones you encounter at the end of the game) and honestly, they are pretty difficult creatures to take down successfully.  If you mess up just a little bit and don't aim for their bodies properly, you will pay for it by taking considerable damage.  Even the ones you discover early in the game are surprisingly tough.  I love it!  That's how it *should* be.

1072	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Alright this will most likely be the only time i will ever give a N64 game 5 stars, but for Goldeneye i eill make an exception. Ok Goldeneye was 64's jump into the world of high tech video game systems, but unfortunately they couldn't keep it up. This was a very solid 1st person shooter, excellent graphics , and not even repetitive secenary, what more could you ask for in a game? The weapons were great, maybe a little exaggerated at times, but over all good. Long levels and lots of them made this game excel in the lasting appeal category. Sound was good, but not having the cd quality sound os a PS or a DC hirt it a little. Unfortunately Goldeneye got a little smack in the face when everybody started comparing it to the flopped Perfect Dark game. But overall a great game and even though i am a die hard Playstation fan i still have a place in my heart for Goldeneye.

The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all 5 games, simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future under-developed, but beautiful lands Myst would take us to..Obviously this game is for a certain type of "quiet" gamer, who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral, button mashing action..If those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however, there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst series..


3123	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	First let me start off by saying that Final Fantasy VII was the beginning of the next generation of gamming, and I'm not just talking about PS1 games, I'm talking about all big games of the present day. FFVII is and was the blueprint for all the "next generation" games of today. Now that's out of the way let's talk about the game. FFVII is still the greatest RPG of all time, graphically the game shows it's age (circa 1997), and the game play isn't exactly the easy moving/user friendly style we're used to today, but those so called draw backs don't hinder the awesome story, the great fantasy atmosphere, and the wonderful characters including Cloud, the quiet and reserved hero of the story and of course Sephiroth, who is in my opinion the greatest bad guy gamming has ever seen (any fan of this game knows what I'm talking about). I'm not going to tell you about the story because I don't want to ruin a great experience, just take my word for it, Final Fantasy VII is still my favorite video game of all time and if you give this masterpiece a chance you won't be disappointed. Five stars!

Hot off the heels of the excellent Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World was the sequel that showcased the SNES's graphical prowess and ability to display new effects. 8 new worlds to explore (plus the hidden star portals) and 99 levels lie in wait for gamers to explore. It introduced new enemy characters as well as the lovable dinosaur Yoshi. And above all, it was extremely fun to play. From the graphics to the music and the easy to get into controls, this game continued the proud tradition of the revered Mario games and set standards for all future platform games to come.

I beat it a few times when I was younger then decided to buy it again, so thats the only reason I blew through it.. but it's so fun trying to find out the secret places and pokemon and getting new items to use. The coolest thing I think is seeing the pokemon run around all in 3-d and realistic like, and trying to find ways to take new pictures is definitely fun. I think it's even fun to watch someone else play.
N64:
guns, almost perfect graphics.
If you are trying to decide between 1, 2 or 3, I'd say three simply because 2 looks exactly like 1 and 3's graphics are a bit better.
The Ups: Lots of  different things to do with this game.  Fun maps.  If I had to pick one  word for UT it would be: FUN.  It has a feel that is very unique, but is  quite enjoyable.  The bots are pretty amazing as well.

I really don't want to give anything away. There are different things you can do to make different outcomes, I would play it once without cheating, and then play it again with a faq to get the best ending. You can do different things sometimes that actually affect the outcome. You can even run away or back out of stuff.
The idea of the game is simple... "manage your economic resources wisely as well as your politics and military to gain supremacy over the other side".
8993	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	"Wild Arms" probably has one of the better story lines that I have seen in console RPGs.  At the beginning, you play the three different characters separately; this basically let's you get used to the strengths and weaknesses of each character.  Shortly after this, all three meet up, and they pretty much stay together for the rest of the game.  Not only are the characters interesting people, but the plot is very well done and executed (though it is one of those save the world plots).  Combat in the game was pretty fun (or at least I thought so), though I can see where some people might not like it as there really isn't a whole lot of strategy to it.  Some of the puzzles in "Wild Arms" can be a little challenging, but most of them are not too hard to figure out.  The game has one thing that some people might consider a downside (I didn't); pretty much everything in the game was polygonal making the graphics a bit dated for the time.  One thing I almost forgot to mention is the game introduction:  when you first start up the game, you are treated to an anime style production that introduces you to all the characters.  This game is a lot of fun to play and well worth spending the money for it.
1. since it is a fighting game, it does get repetitive. But then what fighting game isn't. The story line and having to acquire the chambers interesting.

(where would Capcom be without a hot Girl) the voice acting is very good compared to Resident evil 1 (Jill Sandwhich) And survivor (the phone hang up) the charcters were dedecated to their voice acting. (surprise!) usually capcom screwd that up. the controls were easy to navigate and to remember also they were responsive. the gaphics were great for a PS1 game. the velociraptors had decent AI for the time all except the random red forcefields that some of them were trapped behind. They run into it. which is hilarious to watch. you'll see what i mean if you play it. the puzzles are not to hard unlike RE3 Water treatment puzzle. God help if u don't know the motive to the puzzle. the puzzles in DC are easy to figure out. and are not frustrating. all three weapons were useful in their own way. for example when fighting the T Rex. lord help you if u don't have any grenade rounds. after that you are pretty screwd. the camara angles weren't all that bad. the auto lock on is required. don't ask it just is. Over all a great game. a must buy for capcom fans. Hint steer clear of DC3. DC2 is also very good. happy dino hunting.

The graphics are spectacular, and there are many new areas for you to explore as you journey though the game. There are many  more areas in this game than you typically find in any type of computer  game. Plus, the characters are great, and it actually has a storyline that  would stand up quite well all by itself. My only complaint would be that  some of the puzzles didn't make sense to me. At one point, you take a piece  of tape off the wall, and all of a sudden a character will talk to you who  never wanted to talk to you before. That's just one example. Many of the  puzzles do make sense, though. I still think this is a game that any  adventure gamer would enjoy.

The idea of a sequel to the heralded Super Mario Bros. 3 kept my 7 year old self wide awake at night. Images of Mario flying around in brand new stages filled my head each night as I closed my eyes before sleep. I remember having vivid dreams the Mario Bros. and I going on adventures to rid the Mushroom Kingdom of the Koopa Family. Each morning I would wake to find that my dreams had not come true and I would just go on playing my old copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 like it was the newest game. As you can see I was a delirious and desperate child.

Controller 6/10 IDK wat nintendo was thinking with this, alot of game controls need alot of getting used to, like 2 D-pads & a analog stick? do ya think thats enough?! and its not the most conftorable thing to hold, and the rumble paks do make it significantly heavier then say saturn or PS1 controllers, but it does make 3D games more natural to control
5901	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is Excellent, capital E - Excellent. Make no mistakes though: this is a first person shooter where you must not shoot anyone because everyone is stronger than you and you get chewed up in a face to face  battle: the emphasis is on stealth and invisibility and it's the first time  that I have seen anything like this. It's nice to know that there's still  room for originality in the gaming world.  In this game you are a thief and  (of course) you have to steal stuff. That's it. That's all you have to do.  It's how you have to do it that is gut wrenching: you have to sneak  undetected in shadows and move slowly. It's great that there's a  'stealth-o-meter' on the bottom of the screen: it's a gauge that tells you  how visible and noisy you are at the time. Helps a lot!  I have to give  credit to the designers and developers: they thought this through a lot and  came out with an incredible game play. I just bought this game and I am  amazed at how good it looks in spite of the fact that it is an 'old' game.  The models (soldiers and monsters) move in a very realistic way. On top of  that I am very surprised at the dialogs and voices. I kinda feel guilty to  do it but I really enjoy myself just sitting in a dark corner and listening  to a guard only a few steps away complaining that he is starving or that  his bosses are incompetent or just mumbling senslessly to himself. It also  has a good story line and some levels are really creepy and very well  designed. This game is a must-have if you like a change of pace from the  various Quakes and  Unreals...

5867	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Despite what some of the media hacks might have to say about Drakan: Order of the Flame, it is neither a Tomb Raider knock off or wannabe, because Tomb Raider simply does not have the level of atmosphere or sense of scale. This may be due to the fact that Tomb Raider is playing with a game and  graphics engine that is nearly five years old, with only minor nips, tucks  and improvements in its history while Drakan hit the ground running,  (flying!), with a brand new game engine.
Anyway, the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life.  Others are given through bonus levels, etc.
9515	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I don't really care for these type of fake animal/ lizard things moving and talking. But it is fun when u go back in time and play this old famous game. It is very fun on multiplayer because there is more people to beat the enemies. Which there is a lot of. The graphics r better than most snes games but it is still not very good. The sound is good and the music is very catchy and good. The controls for this game can be hard to get used to. The thing i do not like about it is it is a very hard game and the story is weird. I mean lizards and pigs fighting each other? It is weird. But unstead of the weirdness and how hard it is it is a fun fighting game.

Sound: The music is pretty good, as is the voice-acting. Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting, Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system. Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.
3.  Some unique ways to die and to be transformed.  An opportunity to become  something akin to a paperweight, or perhaps an ash tray.  A chance to find  Love in a bottomless pit.
One thing I didn't mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStations DualShock controllers analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. Theres also a Rookie mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you cant unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.

That is, until I found this game.  For some reason, I was attracted to the title.  It sounded like a fun game.  When I started playing it, I found it to be not only fun but very easy to learn and quite addictive!  All you use is a mouse and you can build your hospital the way you want (including restrooms, staff room complete with pool table and arcade game, soda machines, etc.), hire staff, purchase property for more rooms, etc.  The higher the level you get, the more neat stuff you can build (scanners, x-ray room, operating theatre, even a hair restoration clinic) and the more obstacles you face (earthquakes, emergencies, epidemics, etc.).  There are so many things to control in this game from making sure each staff member is in the proper place to shooting rats that roam your hospital.  Sometimes a stomach virus will spread in the hospital and you have to hurry maintenance men to clean up the vomit (the sound effects are also a hoot).  The game even keeps stats like how many times a bench or soda machine is used so you can rearrange your hospital more efficiently.  I find myself playing this game for hours!  Theme Hospital is definitely worth the money, but you can also buy this game as part of the "Top Ten Blue" pack for less.

The best part of this title isn't those things though, its the ability to save. Previous SMB title you had to play start to finish in one powering on, a problem if you had siblings or power outages. Gameplay is standard 2D Mario though Yoshi can be a pain in the ass at times. Worth buying.

When you play this game in this configuration, it truly is sublime. Weapons are fired at you, but you outrun them. You're bouncing off the wall like crazy, but going so fast it feels like you've got the speed burst weapon on continuous fire. It's easy to see what makes this game so great. It's a great concept executed flawlessly. You have great art direction, great controls, great gameplay, and great music. At a pace so fast it should carry a warning label.
You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it.
All in all, Silent Hill is a convoluted, enthralling game. It may be slightly rough-looking in places but it's well-worth the ride, and an absolute MUST if you intend to play the laterst installment. Highly recommended.

The really good Squaresoft games have an anoying habit of falling out of print quickly, making this game in particular hard to find, let alone at a reasonable price. Anyone who still shops around for SNES games knows this, as well do the people who have tried to find the FF Anthology at their game shop, only to be met with "Sorry, it's no longer available". This is really sad because there are many people who will not get to experience these games, and will go on thinking that the FF series never got better than  part VII or IX.

I find it to be one of the greatest entertainment tragedies seeing one of my childhood favorite activies, video games, decline from good clean fun and degerate into nightmare-inducing blood baths of gore, and violence.
Also, the way to progress is not really that intuitive.  I found myself running around an empty castle a lot trying to figure out wth I'm supposed to do next.  By far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles.  As you run down a hall, you hit a map trigger that changes your point of view; unfortunately you have no idea what view you will get.  Sometimes you will be looking ahead from behind/above your character, other times you will look at your character's face from ahead/left.  It is weird and extremely unpleasant as you can switch angles during fights accidentally and get your [rear-end]kicked.

A completion percentage tells you how much of the game you have cleared for each save file. Mario can still fly and shoot fireballs, but now he also gets an assortment of colored dinosaurs called Yoshis to ride around on.

PERSONALLY I LIKE THE MORTAL KOMBAT KOMBO SYSTEM AND OVER ALL FORMULA BETTER THAN ANY OTHER FIGHTING GAME. FAVORITE FIGHTERS R' QUAN CHI, REPTILE, SUBZERO & LIU KANG. LEAST FAVORITES R'... OH I LIKE'M ALL. WANNA CHEAT MENU FOR EASY FATALITIES? TRY THIS: GO TO OPTIONS, HIGHLIGHT 'CONTINUES' HOLD BLOCK & RUN AT THE SAME TIME FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS, YOU WILL HEAR "OUTSTANDING" CONTINUE TO HOLD THE BUTTONS FOR 3 MORE SECONDS. A MENU WILL APPEAR. NOW WHEN IT SAYS 'FINISH HIM' YOU MAY PERFORM A FATALITY BY HOLDING DOWN & PRESSING THE B BUTTON.
Bonus/ For a bonus ending, Try finding all the gems. I had the manual and I still missed one someplace in the game.
I wrote about it for schoolwork, projects, and homework.  (So then my teacher knew all about it, haha.)  I wrote about it in my journal.  I played it all the time.  His voice is stuck in my head for life, and it was an amazing experience.  The videos in the game are wonderful, and the action, characters, and graphics suck you in.  I remember it as being THE best experience one could find on a SEGA system at the time.  If only they had also ported Princess Crown....
PS: It is up to you if you are going to believe all the lies about FF8. I actually find that the games most people praise a lot are not the ones worth buying. Not to go off topic but games like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Fear may be considered the best horror games. But really games like Fatal Frame, Haunting Ground, The Calling, Rule of the Rose, Kuon, Koudelka, etc are 10 times better in storyline or scarier.

4457	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game just rocks! I have had it since the day it came out and i still haven't got tired of it. The campaigns in this game may be its only weak link, as they are fairly easy and there aren't very many of them. What i  love most about this game is JanesCombat.net. You can play against 7 other  players over the internet and have a 4 on 4 dogfight. That has given me  hours of entertainment. If you love flying games, you have to get this one!

Years later, I am interested in re-acquiring as many of these games as I can. But reading all these reviews in reference to computer compatibility is a concern. So after much research I found "Good Old Games" website that allows a person to download the games onto their CURRENT computer. These games are formated to work on current operating systems. And you can't beat the cost. (Riven is $5.99). They don't have Exile or Revelations, but just about everything else. Definitely worth checking out, so you don't waste your money trying to download a game that won't run on today's systems.

7502	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	I am going to agree with every poster who said this game is really easy. I also want to say however that this game looks great and is a lot of fun I just think the downloadable version on the Nintendo Wii looks the best. The game's graphics look absolutely refurbished and redone on the Wii making it look more like a 128 bit game then a 64 bit one. The gameplay is really simplistic once you realize all you have to do in about every level is just eat enough fruit to pass the stage. Like Yoshi's Island before it the challenge isn't in passing each level it's getting a perfect high score. That said, this game may not appeal to Mario purists simply because Mario isn't a playable charachter and the gameplay is  a lot easier than pretty much every Mario game. Once you beat the game there really isn't much to keep you playing it over and over again other than the beautiful graphics. So I rate the graphics a 10 out of 10(10 being the best), the fun 5 out of 10 and the challenge a measly 3 out of 10.
I personally wish it were a  little less violent, but compared to other games out there, this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of, buy this  game.
  Now, for the GOODS of this game.

With all due respect to T. Byrl, the voice  acting is a bit strained, though not the worst we've heard.
If you're interested in Mech  Warrior or that kind of robot-based game, you'll probably like customizing  your warriors in here, and building your attack force. If you're a raw  strategist, you might want to start with Dark Reign 2 and then get this as  a fun side game to play.
But the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay. Seriously, I beat this game in half an hour! And when did blood ever become an ink error?

Ogre enters Tekken 3  and is beaten and killed!

I highly recommend this Mega Memory Card!

The  storyline is also intriguing. Imagine playing a character who CANNOT be  killed, who is extremely powerful but has lost all memory of his abilities.  The Nameless One is probably the most mysterious character to ever be  created in a computer game - and his story ranks as one of the best ever  told.
Mario 64 is well loved and remembered, but it is kind of strange that the Nintendo 64's launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed. Super Mario World on Super Nintendo was a gem, but there were other great games in the SNES library. However, with the Nintendo 64, Super Mario 64 along with Zelda Ocarina of Time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the Nintendo 64 library, which is disappointing considering that we see the Nintendo 64 was capable of supporting top-notch games. The Nintendo 64 library just didn't manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game.

The soundtrack is definitely creepy including the atmosphere and you can get multiple alternate endings depending on how you play this game, the killer himself is very much in the style of Michael Myers and Cropsy from The Burning combined. It spawned 2 sequels which neither can withstand the first installment so far. A movie is in the works and maybe they should do a reboot game on this which can be good.
FFVIII introduces the new Junction System.  This system eliminates the MP magic system, and instead, the only way you gain magic is by using the Draw command to suck it out of your enemies.  In order to use the Junction System, you must have acquired a GF (or Summon in other FFs) and link with them to build your abilites and stats.

I really don't know what other game to compare this to, so I can't really say if you'll like it. It's a one of a kind game that deserves at least a look. My recommendation is to look up some gameplay videos and decide if it looks like something you would enjoy.

Throughout each level is a key.  It is Mario's job to grab it and unlock the doors so that he can proceed to the next levels and so on.  But many traps and enemies will await him!  Thankfully, Mario himself has some new abilities to help him progress:  he can perform handstands, causing him to jump higher (press the down button twice); he can use an arrow item to create makeshift ladders or bridges; he can drop coconuts or deploy that famous hammer to destroy enemies (you can even swing the hammer up in the air), and so much more!  Furthermore, if you collect the 3 items strewn throughout each level (ex:  a parasol), you will enter a bonus game where you will get a chance to earn more lives!
6698	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Originally reviewed at Last-Gen.com:
The plot tended to be confusing at times, at least for the first time through.  However, it was intriguing, and Sephrioth is a refreshingly evil bad guy.  The final battle against him was pathetically easy (I killed him twice in a row without dying once at level 60 or so), but up until the point you actually fight him in his final form, he's a truely malevolent villain.
The boss fights are another story, though. Some of these are not well though out in the slightest. You'll have 3 encounters with Catwoman, with each fight playing out nearly the same as it did before, as well as 3 fights with the Penguin. The first two being ridiculously easy, the last being one of the toughest challenges I've seen in a game. Batman Returns has balancing issues, to be sure, but makes up for it by simply being an otherwise wonderful experience.

If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way!

There is next to no innovation.  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake, the puzzles are of  the annoying "find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack, etc" style.  The sense of immersion is zero.  The  sounds are poorly choosen.  The enemies are, for the most part, utterly  uninspired.  The load times between segments (which uses the Half-Life  formula) are ridiculously long.  It's also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment.

Killer Instinct was worth picking up back in 1995 and is still worth playing to this very day.

After playing 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, Tactics and the first Tactics Advance game, I must say that this game is still my favorite Final Fantasy. It's spectacular. And while I honestly don't think I could play through the game again today it still holds up as one of the best games I've ever played. Definitely the best RPG game I've ever played. If I hadn't booted it up and played it so much in the past I might feel different about owning it again. However, if you've never played the game (do you live under a rock?!) then it's really a great idea to try it somehow.

The gameplay is like no other.  One of the few incredible games to utilize the C Buttons for vital controls, this game felt really comfortable to play, and there's tons to do in the game besides just beating it.  Also, throughout the game, you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as Young or Adult Link to complete the game, which is awe-inspiring in my opinion.  Sadly, after doing little everything, there's no addictive mini-games to really play and not much else to do, but go through the game again and again.

Of course thats just my opinon.  I could be wrong.  :P
All in all I find it to be a game offering many enjoyable hours.. though it is hard to "FORCE IT" to play your play style.. you instead have to probe for play styles that fit the nature of the challenges of your particular game. I still find myself playing this now and then even 10 years after it's release.
Despite the fact that this game is 21 years-old as of writing this, the graphics in Sonic the Hedgehog still look really good.  This game, along with Sonic's sequels in for the Sega Genesis, would take full advantage of the Genesis's processing capabilities to generate beautiful, eye-catching graphics that do an excellent job of creating visual depth by adding many shades and highlights to various objects.  I think the levels with the best imagery in this game are the Green Hill Zone, Starlight Zone, and Scrap Brain Zone.  Even Sonic and other characters in the game, which are smaller than the beautiful environments, have a good deal of visual depth to them thanks to the proper use of colors within the game platform's hardware limitations.

 The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game. You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game. You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does; but don't worry, the levels are completely different from each the second game. The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game. The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal is the same as the second game; obtain the crystal hidden in the area. Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race. The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes, or completing a hidden level or task. Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber, a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available to play. By defeating a boss you unlock a new power, theres the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful, the double jump, a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period, a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.
Buy if,
Not many weapons and items are hidden in crazy locations (except the flute maybe, but it's not that difficult to find).  So you won't often be looking at your TV screen with a confused look on your face wondering where something is, because most of the time you just have to walk around talking to people and experimenting with your weapons and items and eventually you will find what you need to progress further into the quest.  So if you come across something unusual and don't know the purpose of it, try some of your items on it to see if anything happens.

All things considered, I don't see any major bad points to discuss in this game.  It's a great one to own, especially for anyone who likes the superior quality RPGs from the SNES days.

- In the What the Heck? level, the sound those floating black monsters with sharp teeth make upon finishing them off is hilariously bad!  It sounds like a ghost cuddling up to a teddy bear underneath a blanket, lol.  Actually it sounds more like a rooster with a muffled voice being strangled.  I never thought about it until now but these monsters are basically the same thing as the dogs from New Junk City except they fly in the air so they pose more of a threat.  In the Super NES version, these particular enemies sound loud and demonic which is more appropriate.

4459	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Despite not being a fan of other Jane's Fighters games, I enjoyed this entry.  The premise is obvious - fly missions in Europe's war-ton skies in the famous fighters of the day.  The format of the sim is similar to that of other Jane's fighters titles - you have a flight panel that's more for show than functional; you have separate pop-up windows for your instruments or to spot and range the enemy; you can click on individual targets and handy steering cues point the way to the enemy.  That said, WW2F is graphically a more modern generation of sim than those like USNF or ATF.  Graphics are more realistically defined, and are more immersive than those games.  The planes (instantly recognizable to any mil/av buff) look so realistic, you half expect to see your reflection in their chrome finish.  Atmospheric effects are clearly superior to the first CFS (which roughly coincided with this game) - including clouds, AAA fire and smoke effects from wounded aircraft.  Flight is difficult even at nominal settings - aircraft here are unstable, and may fly apart if overstressed, or simply fall out of the sky if load-factor isn't watched.  AI is somewhat impressive (I mean, I routinely got shot out of the sky, but I'm normally a horrible pilot), though must be compromised to an extent to fit a game where everybody in fighters will fight each other.  (Case in point being Me-262 jets, which will remain in prolonged combat with prop fighters like the Mustang, even though there principal quarry was the box formations of allied bombers; their acceleration and turning capabilities made them unsuited for dogfighting.)  For its great atmospheric effects, nothing seems to cover up an unconvincing attempt to model the terrain of Europe - although most of your work will be up high.  The campaign mode isn't quite dynamic, but it's not as canned as the one on CFS.

It's a unique, fun, and unpredictable game that many people have played.  The graphics might not be the best (they seriously don't have to be), and the sound may be odd sometimes, this makes a solid game that is fun.
 (Notion! Don't take this game too seriously because you are killing only visual characters not real humans.)
I gotta say it, the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through, especially if you ran across the Terrance and Phillip bombs! Other than that, I really didn't feel there was much else besides all the cool codes (like all the weapons codes and stuff) and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like Officer Barbrady, Mr. Mackey (M'kay), Terrance and Phillip and if you really wanted to, Starvin' Marvin.

4195	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I remember playing this game years ago when I was 10 years old and having the hardest time in the world beating the first 5 single player missions. I finally gave up and started using cheats like "power overwhelming" to blaze through the missions. The last few protoss missions in the original I proclaimed "impossible" without cheats because none of my ten year old friends at the time could beat it as well. However I still found the game addicting and played for hours with my friends via connected modems.
5647	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	Absolutely the worst game in the excellent Quakes. This certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay. What I hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you don't have to think. Getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires! This game is just like UT, bad. Utterly bad! I have constantly tried to like it, but failed at every attempt. Avoid at all costs!
I still highly recommend this game, and I commend Black Isle for putting the RP back into RPG.  The setting and story are compelling and unpredictable and the party members are rich and interesting instead of just someone to hold your treasure.  So, if you are biting your nails in anticipation for Diablo 2, give Torment a try (and if you haven't already, try Baldur's and Fallout2) you will be glad you did.

Mortal Kombat Gold is more than a MK4 remake. It's a great game packed with 8 additional playable characters (Cyrax, Mileena, Kitana, Kung Lao, Baraka, Sektor, Noob Saibot and Goro -these last three are hidden but yet playable), so you have a big total of 23 (15 came from the original MK4).

Flight Model:  The flight model is as complex or accurate as you want it - or as dumbed down and "Nintendo" as you want it.  Many settings are at your disposal.  If you have full HOTAS and rudder pedals, you can change the many control settings to be very accurate.  Top notch compared to others.  I can also run this game on a 133MHz Pentium I pulled out of mothballs or on the latest, greatest P4s with gigabytes of RAM, and the helo flies the same without speeding up or becoming unrealistic.  That's how well the engine and flight model were written.  I will even dare say that the flight model feels better and more solid than the otherwise vastly superior Comanche 4.

The main complaint of Blast Corps has always been that the final few missions are too hard to complete. Either there's too much stuff to destroy, too little time, or the vehicles are too hard to maneuver (especially the dump truck). While all this is true, it's all part of the fun that makes up Blast Corps. There's nothing more nerve-wracking than taking down a building with the missile carrier three seconds behind you. In fact, a few levels are purposely designed to give you as little breathing room as possible, so players should never give up. I don't consider myself a strong video-gamer; I never completed 00 Agent on GoldenEye, gotten all the medals in Rogue Squadron, or finished Banjo/Mario/Donkey Kong without looking at a cheat guide. Yet I still got through Blast Corps. My point? Anyone with a little patience and determination can complete this game. Consider it a test that seperates the true gamers from the pretenders.
8136	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is the best Mario game in the world! I love it so much. We got it back when it first came out back in the 90's. But I was only like 3 or 4 years old. So buy it!!!!!!
The Hub Worlds are amazing, and so are the action fields.
The game, gameplay, and graphics are very similar to the original NES game only better.  First of all, you'll never fall to your death in vertically oriented stages because they can now scroll both up and down.  Horizontal stages can also scroll in both directions while the NES original was locked into scrolling to the right.  Pit is easier to control because he's larger in relation to the screen and now has the ability to "float" down with his tiny wings in a move similar to the Raccoon tail in Super Mario Bros. 3.
You can play it for months. I played it for over a year, then came back and played it for another year. It's probably the most addictive game I've ever played. Not Mario, not Zelda, not the great Doom, not Quake or Half-life or Warcraft or even Grand Theft Auto has ever had me as hooked as this game. Microsoft and Ensemble Studios hit the nail on the head with AOE 2.
Lots of people extol the graphics in GoldenEye, but graphics in Mario Kart 64 is better. First of all, it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better. The gameplay is simple, but that only means it's easier to learn. The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing.
Conclusion: Blood Omen Legacy Of Kain is a wonderful game. if you like deep and involving computer RPGs then this is the game for you. All is wonderful about the game, the setting, the story, everything. The only thing I could say that pull it a bit down is that it is a bit to repetitive, it is cool to hack pesky villagers and monsters like to bits and drain their blood, but there is a limit to how long that is fun. I would give this game 9 out of 10, with only the bit repetitative game play and the sub par graphics pulling it down from a full 10. Still if you own a Playstation or a Playstation 2 and like RPG's and fantasy games, then get your hands on Blood Omen Legacy Of Kain. You will not regret it.
Overall, stick with Vigilante 8. Don't bother with this sequel. It's a downgrade from the 1st. On one player anyway, I haven't tried the multiplayer, but take my advice if you intend to play one player. It's not worth it. It's all graphics and no fun.

and the Ugly:

The game was Messed up!  And some stuff just didn't follow up.
It's more like the old  "Operation Wolf" arcade came but in first person. The most  enjoyable part is being able to use the sniper rifle to dispatch baddies  from a distance is great fun.

A big difference with this game in comparison to the later ones is that the psychological aspects are less well-defined. As a result, it feels less cohesive than the later games. That's not to say that it doesn't have sad or scary moments, though. It definitely has those (more the latter than the former), but is held back by the dated technology and bad voice acting. I actually still like the graphics because the distinctly rusted and bloody design of the parallel world shines through, and there are some fine textures and special lighting effects. The more realistic prerendered cutscenes still hold up well. A unique aspect of these scenes is that they have no dialog whatsoever, which was an artistic challenge that paid off in conveying the characters' emotions better than the unearthly voice acting could.

8833	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Rare had a pretty good "first-time" streak with their games. They mastered platforming in both 2D and 3D with Donkey Kong Country and Banjo Kazooie; 1st-person shooting with GoldenEye; kart-racing with Diddy Kong Racing; and of course, 2D fighting with Killer Instinct.
Also, the game is VERY customizable and includes special mission based objectives.  Furthermore, you don't have to win by taking every piece of territory if you don't want to.  You can win by taking over 80% of the world or if you want a quickie 60% of the world!

  I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics.  Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: "Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A." Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.

3745	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Sonic Adventure took Sonic to an amazing level, and it only took 5 years of Sega Saturn failures. The first thing Sonic does is fight a monster called "Chaos". After beating Chaos, the camera turns to Eggman, who ominously tells himself Sonic has no idea what he is up against... the perfect start to the game. Sonic then goes off to rescue Tails from a plane crash, starting the first level. Emerald Coast was a beautifully rendered beach with a beautiful theme and HUGE 3D ACTION! The camera shifts and Sonic is suddenly is being chased by a giant whale! After that he runs through a tight cave... and then finally rescues Tails! After a happy reunion, Eggman steals Tail's Chaos Emerald and feeds it to... Chaos the monster. Congratulations, you can now play as Tails! He can fly! His levels involve racing Sonic and Eggman (Just like in Sonic R!), and thats about it. The best thing about Tails was his inspirational motto, "I want to fly high! I shall belive in myself!". After Tails was Knuckles, who had a totally different story. One night he was rethinking his life and why exactly he was guarding the Master Emerald, when somebody steals the Master Emerald (way to go, Knucklehead)! His levels are composed of finding the Master Emerald pieces. Knuckles wasn't nearly as good as Tails. After Knuckles comes Amy Rose, Sonic's... girlfriend. Her levels focused on platforming while avoiding a robot that decided to chase her. Maybe a 6 year old girl would find Amy and her obnoxious theme song cool, but the teenage nerd reviewing this finds Amy very annoying. Big was next... and Sega really should avoided this idea while in development. Big is a BIG "cat", according to the Sonic Team. He really looked like a purple bunny-bear creature. His whole goal was to find his pet frog... Froggy (what a clever name!). It was torture watching him trudge to some water in the great zones Sonic and Tails enjoyed. Twinkle Park was only a lake for Big. For Sonic it was a bumper car ride followed by intense platforming, and the great voices Sonic, Tails, Amy, E-102 Gamma, and Eggman made Big even worse. In a dumb voice Big constantly shouts "FROGGY! WHERE ARE YA!?".
So theres a few final things I have to say here:

1615	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics, use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake.


You play as this Hot spy named Joanna Dark...And boy this woman dark as she hides and go seeks aiming for what her missions are and completeng them when told.
Twisted Metal 3: good
Saying this game is groundbreaking isn't really enough. Resident Evil 2 opened peoples eyes about the mystery and fascination of zombies, and how frightening they can be. Capcom showed people how zombies walking around moaning and spitting can catch your attention and frighten you. The zombies shown in movies aren't nearly as scary as the ones in this game, in my opinion. Zombie movies are laughable, almost like comedy movies. In a video game, it's a more serious and terrifying situation. Not to mention much bloodier in video game form. I'm sure you can find me an example of a scary zombie movie, but I haven't seen one yet.
One thing that is pretty amazing is that this game is entirely free of violence, blood, or action, yet it's fun for all ages. It's good for kids because it is peaceful and non-violent, and makes them use strategy and helps them calculate time. It's good for older people too because it is challenging and there are many surprises to keep you coming back for more. This game has a very high replay value, because each time you play it it is completely different (you can marry 5 different girls, and depending on which one you persue, the game changes a lot). The absense of action & fighting makes it easier to concentrate on strategy. The graphics aren't great, but personally I don't mind-- the animals and people are really cute and chunky, and the controls are easy to master.

This game actually has superior gameplay to Final Fantasy Tactics in terms of realism, size, difficulty and strategy requirements.  True, you did lack the freedom, and the job system in Final Fantasy Tactics was far superior, but here strategy is required for more than survival and victory: sometimes you need to do something to the terrain itself.  I loved that.

What makes this worse is that this game wasted a truly engaging and frightening antagonist in Jenova in favor of this guy. Even though Jenova is the single most important figure in the story she ends up playing second fiddle to a pretty boy in a black cape. Maybe it's just the Lovecraft fan in me, but an ancient cosmic being whose undying cells can eventually reunite and bring it back to life, and who can manipulate humans to its own insidious, unfathomable ends by projecting illusions and false memories into their minds seems like a much more deserving of the "primary antagonist" designation than Norman Bates with prettier hair and a longer knife.
Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether, you're pretty much hyped and can't wait to see the rest of the game. Unfortunately, when you do, you realize that the game falls flat on its face. Star Wars: SotE had a lot of potential. It's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you're part of the awesome story it conveys. But that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics, robot like controls, bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been. Only the die hard Star Wars fans would pick this up. For everyone else, be warned as other Star Wars games released for the N64 are much, much better than this somewhat playable effort.

4397	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This really is a great game.  When it first came out, I was burned out on real-time strategy games, having played Warcraft 2 to death.  I played the first 15 Starcraft missions, then gave up on it.  Partly, my nerves were  shot:  RTS does that to it.  It's a very frenetic type of game, with lots  of rapid clicking, scrolling around on the map, trying to keep it all under  control.  You have to hold a lot of stuff in your short term memory, and  (in the harder levels) the constant onslaught of enemy attacks tends to  make you forget what you were trying to do.  --This is one down side of RTS  games in general, and Starcraft is no exception in this regard.

Except this, you can also kill people in your park. You can build a non-finish rollar coaster and then start it, when the rollar-coaster-car reach there, it will throw away and 'BOMB', all the people in the car will die immediately! But this is a healthy game for children and kill people will diminish your park's rating so I don't think you should do that.

  The unfortunate aspect of online gaming is, of course, the lag factor. Often you must shoot several mech lengths ahead of your opponent to actually hit them, which can be very annoying. But if you can suppress your ego long enough to master this irritatiing quirk, suffer many defeats, and learn what it takes to survive the online world of MW3, it is awesome. The array of different weapons and equipment at your disposal, the stunningly beautiful mech chasis in your arsenal....I've owned Mechwarrior three for over two years now, and I know I will always come back to it for more.

The game has some funny hidden jokes, and some of the manners in which you acquire the Gwar tickets are hilarious. A little practice and patience are required during some of the tougher areas, such as The Street or the chase at the Hospital, but other than that, the toughest part of the game is figuring out what you have to do to acquire the ticket pieces. Figuring out what to do is half the fun, though.
The PROS: Outside of a few missing animations and voice overs from the over the top announcer, this is a near perfect arcade port of the hit arcade game. If you weren't able to play this in the arcades, now is your chance to see why lots of people lined up for this one. This was very impressive for a game that was part of the first batch of games available for the N64 and gave Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat a run for its money. Learning all of the moves, combos and combo breakers for each character will keep you quite busy. And when you're bored playing by yourself, grab a friend for the VS. mode or set up a tournament so you can get more friends to play against. The controls are pretty easy to get into despite how the controller looks. And no matter what difficulty level you set, the game will still challenge you; the same goes for the boss character, Gargos, who will cheese you to victory every time so be warned.

I remember when Sierra was pumping out incredible adventure games at a very impressive rate...............seemingly successful ones too.  However Sierra is for all practical purposes dead in the Adventure world(see KQ:mask of eternity).

All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability.
Accomplished rewarding feeling of beating the tough x4 bosses without using weaknesses.

Indeed, Starcraft is a great game! From story line to playability, this game has it all. I totally suggest it to anyone who wants a game that will provide you with hours and hours of gameplay.


In conclusion, I would not pick this RE in particular for anyone new to the series. With the inclusion of nemesis, you are required to make split second decisions, and it will often confuse,a nd ultimately lead to the death of more novice players. If you are new to the series, try RE 2, RE 1 has a few problems present for newer players, but RE 2 is the perfect balance of horror, and simplicity. If your a veteran to RE, look no further for fun, just don't expect it to be a cake walk!

757	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Yes, TR3 is a bear (so to speak ;-).  E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you.  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end).  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, "Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.  But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.

The music in the game is a bunch of Van Halen-like heavy metal songs, with maybe a touch of crunchy Megadeth riffs thrown in for good measure.  If this kind of music bothers you, prepare yourself, because the entire game is dominated with this kind of music.  It's a little heavier than you might think.  Get ready.  However, some of the music is starting to grow on me.

Tekken 3, despite all the positive reviews, does NOT appeal to me whatsoever. The fighting is really clunky, and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other. It's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me. It's boring to watch, and even more boring to play. Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it's time to do the same thing in a video game? I have no idea. If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3, you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons. Strong emphasis on the word "simple". Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button, and then jump over to the Square button. How is someone supposed to easily master this? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy.

6521	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	yea...i love it and thanks.
I'd read that Nox is very fast, and boy, was that an understatement.  Battles in this game, particularly in the latter stages, needs amazing reflexes, something I'm not overly endowed with.  However, I am blessed with cunning and persistence, and after my character died three or four (or even ten) times, I'd managed to figure out the puzzle, or a good strategy against the monster(s).  Some of the later monsters move with lightning speed, often only needing one hit to splatter Jack and his gear all over the screen, so a well-positioned charmed or summoned ally makes an excellent distraction, allowing Jack the nanosecond needed to get off a good shot or spell (I didn't have much success with bombs).

Planescape contains one of the most unique and interesting settings and the best writing and plot I have ever seen in a video game.

3125	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I had purchased a Playstation months before this title came out, specifically anticipating a great upgrade of the Super Nintendo titles Squaresoft had been producing up til this point. This game far exceeded my hopes and wishes, impressing me with the 3D characters, the story, the materia system, even the music. It's what rewarded me for waiting and choosing Sony for my new gaming platform. I've been a great fan of their games that followed, especially their landmark success Final Fantasy X for the PS2.
No matter what I say, I can never feel as though I'm doing this game justice. It's a masterwork, the greatest end product to ever emerge from the renowned studios of Squaresoft. Its concentration on the organization, application and implementation of magic into each character's physical attributes appealed to the anal-retentive librarian in me, while the epic storyline, unimaginably cool cutscenes and untouchable characters swept me off my feet. I have my doubts about Square's ability to recapture this past glory, considering the slow downward slope they've presented with each new chapter of the Final Fantasy series since the turn of the millennium, but that can't drag down my utter devotion to the perfection of this title.

I also clearly remember my classmates loved this movie and it was VERY popular for at least a few months, and was actually the talk of the town in my school.  I also remember Elton John had a resurgence in popularity with classics such as "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" and "Circle of Life" which dominated the radio airwaves.

Starcraft is easily the best thing to come  from the gods at Blizzard. It is the best real-time strategy game  available. Bar-none.
Looking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.

If you enjoyed "A Link to the Past" you will most certainly like this game as well. The story of Ocarina of Time involves going back and forth in time, between a happy peaceful Hyrule, and a dark evil one, much like ALTTP; but don't think this is a rip-off on its predecessor. The complex dungeons, challenging bosses, and deepening story lines will blow you away. The 3D element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before.

All this plus intricate plot twists and an inspiring storyline constantly push this game forward. Suikoden is undeniably one of the best RPGs ever made. Not only that, but Suikoden isn't a game that can be finished in a few days either. Suikoden is long (about 25+ hours) and it doesn't get boring... ever.

This game is not just a simple alien bug hunt.  Stealth is key, and survival is very hard.  The game has an extensive (and sometimes confusing) role-playing system that gives you a variety of ways to develop and equip your character.  In addition, there are about a hundred gadgets and goodies to pick up and use for survival.  The role-playing system has some faults though.  One is that certain skills, like hacking, are too overpowered compared to others, like psionics.  You can't survive the game without a good hacking skill.  Also, there are contrivances in the game that seem to be there to force you to buy certain skills.  For example, weapons are absurdly fragile, so you have to learn the "repair" and "maintain" skills to use them.  I like the role-playing aspects, but "Deus Ex" is better in that department.

Some came with a Resident Evil 3 Demo, which was cool, and Resident Evil 3 of course came with a Dino Crisis Demo. Pick this one up!
This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid.
EDIT: Oops, I take back what I said about Razor Ramon's missing Super Pile Driver move... it is in this game after all! Dunno what I was doing yesterday, but it wouldn't work, but today it's working fine!
However, the game is far from perfect.  The biggest downer for me has been the game's lack of variety and flexibility.  The variety of weapons, tools and other goodies available is low, which makes your character one-dimensional.  In addition, you carry over none of your loot or weapons from mission to mission, so your character does not develop like you see in the usual role-playing game.  Because of this, there is a tinge of repetitiveness in each mission.  Interaction with non-player characters is virtually nil, and thus, you don't become immersed in the story line.  Another aspect of this game that I didn't like was the existence of the usual role-playing cliches like the existence of monsters and the undead.

Mechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it's easy or hard to master).  The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn.  This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you'll pretty much have them down!  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I'm usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they're pretty tough if you don't know how to handle them right).  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I've never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one!  In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there's no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there's no password feature either.  You'll probably get sick of the first level for that reason.  While it's not a deal breaker, this game isn't for the busy person who's looking to play for only an hour or less and quit.  If you want to experience the true value of this game, you'd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it.  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, "This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!"

FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin)
My only real complaint with this game is that in the Special Stage, Tails can make it more difficult for the fact that he's prone to getting hit by bombs, so you have to be extra careful with how you play in the stages.
9825	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I don't know about the other incarnations of Batman Returns, but the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version is downright atrocious. The controls are stiff and slow, Batman himself moves at a snails pace and is frequently unable to move out of the way of oncoming enemies. The sound effects are awful and the combat system is very, very poor. Such a shame considering&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Batman/dp/B000KLMPIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Batman</a>&nbsp;was so good. Even the music in this one disappoints in comparison to the brilliant tunes in the first game. The only positive thing I can mention about this waste of time and effort are the nice looking graphics which really evoke the gloomy, wintry feel of a frozen Gotham City. Otherwise, avoid!

6602	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	First of all I'm going to talk about the better of the 2, Japan's FFVI (aka USA's FFIII).  Aside from USA's FFII, this is the best Final Fantasy ever!  This game was first released in the USA for the SNES console.  Even then the music in this game was comparable to that of games played on the PSX, the 32-bit Sony system.  The graphics are also great, 3-dimensional.  Besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile.  It's a long one!  There's so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that it's almost unbelievable.  It's a wonder why I didn't choose this one to be #1 instead of FFII.  I guess it's because in my mind FFII is the one that started the greatness of the FF series.  Since FFII, the FF series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good.  Not to bag on FFI, but the story was rather weak and besides, it was on the 8-bit Nintendo system.  If you have been let down by any Final Fantasy you've ever played, this is the one to play.  There's so many different characters you can get in this game as well, but you have to know how to get them.  My favorite is the Ninja, because he has a mind of his own, and you never know what he's going to say or do.
4387	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	As I said, This is a good game, Acctually it's a great game. One of the best strategy games i have played(Along with Age of Empires 2 and The Sims).  I have always liked another game, age of empires as whell(I reccomend you check that out too), But this is a little bit different.  Unlike in AoE, were you just control humans, in this you control one of three species. The Zerg, The Protoss or the Terran(Human).Each with there own special units and abilitys.  The Graphics are acctually pretty good, Though some looks a little to cartoony(Not cartoony, i mean to much like animated stough).  You have 3 campiangs to play.(Duh, one for each Race/Species).  The one problem with it is its map editer.  I had always liked creating my own maps and scenarios in Aoe and was looking forward to creating maps on this game, but was dissapionted.  You can decide on the terrain and were resurces are and where you start, but thats about it.  It has this stupid dfault thing were evan if you "DO" put units, They just put your town center/Conrl center/Nexus, etc, and four worker units.  There is suppose to be some thing you type in in the propertis box to change this but it never works no matter what I do.  Despite this problem, its a good game.  Buy it
The gameplay of Tactics is reasonably balanced, in the sense that there are not many situations in which one overly powerful and convenient approach to winning battles makes every other possible strategy obsolete. Like other job-system games, the player can create these situations himself, by overcommitting to the equipment and abilities for a particular job for certain characters, thereby forcing himself to use the same strategy for every battle, or sacrifice the majority of his characters' power, but the game itself offers many different feasable play possibilities. Different sections of the game will present different challenges depending on how the player's party is configured, such as Ramza's one-on-one battle with Gafgarion, the "outnumbered" battle at Golgorand execution site, or the rooftop "save Rafa" battle, and unless the player's party is so ridiculously overpowered as to allow for massively inefficient gameplay, the tactical perameters of each battle require a rethinking of the player's strategy, as elements such as attack strength, attack range, and character mobility must be alternately prioritized.
The game puts you in the role of the Nameless One, a perfect character for customization and self-discovery, which are what make this game so attractive.  The story has several elements of the standard myth, but your character is strangely post-modern and existential.  You will encounter a wide variety of settings, styles, and characters as you travel around Sigil, the city at the center of the universe, and the worlds to which it is connected.  You will have an enormouse amount of freedom to act and explore, which may sometimes have you exploring for hours off the main track of the storyline.  Because of this, Planescape: Torment may take over 100 hours to complete just for the first time.  However, with sufficient focus I am certain it could be done in half that time.

821	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.

This is one of the finest piece of fighting game I've played on the N64.

This game had some really impressive graphics on the N64 and once again shocked me at how incredible the graphics for N64 are.  The action is fast pace and never looses its touch and cause me to play hours and hours of none stop story mode AND just plain fighting it out with friends or bots.  The game is incredible and should be played by all Nintendo Fans.  I found this to be far superior then most fighting games But SSBM was better then this but hey this one is a classic!  It features some awesome Levels and great Handicapped matches.  It's cool how you can also set up any match you.  You can also try to beat time records in story mode so you can get New secret characters like Captain Falcon.  The game was very impressive and this is why I gave it the score it got.  Classic...

8166	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	It's not X. I don't know what they were thinking when they released this piece of garbage. X is a monster in this game and he sounds like an ass.
The music is less distinct than later games, and favors some very odd, disturbing tracks (such as "My Heaven"; go ahead, look it up on YouTube! >:D) that are less melodic and more industrial. On the other hand, from the weapons to the monsters to the environmental noise, the sound effects fit the game very well. They serve to make Silent Hill seem more alive.

Some reviewers claim this game is hard.  It's really not that hard once you remember the most effective and damaging moves. It's easier than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  In fact, if you consider yourself a fast gamer, you won't have ANY trouble with In Your House.  There's an option to put the game on easy, so if you must, put the game on easy.  Also turning blocking off helps make the game much easier.  Using the run button that's located at the top of the Playstation controller (I believe it's either L2 or R2, or maybe both) is a MUCH better idea than using the OTHER way of running (hitting two buttons at once- ugh!)
The gameplay that makes Final Fantasy Tactics a treat. Thanks to the job system, customization is nearly endless. Before each battle you can assign jobs to your characters. Each job has specific traits about them and can greatly affect how you perform in battle. Mages have devastating magic abilities while Knights are strong physical attackers. They also bring their own unique abilities to the table. Because there are so many job classes to choose from, there's a lot of experimentation you can do. As you master abilities you'll also be able to mix and match. You could have a Squire casting white magic, for example provided you've learned some of the white magic abilities.
The other major departure from the original series is that your main antagonist is no longer Dr. Wily: this time, it is a sinister "reploid" named "Sigma", as in, the last letter of the greek alphabet. Also, the robot masters no longer have the "man" suffix (ex: Flame Mammoth, Chill Penguin), which is actually cool. The battles are also varied as opposed to the initially predictable battles of years passed: most of the bosses have two different types of attacks that they use (ex: Storm Egale dives from the sky and shoots a horizontal tornado-like wind gust when he is land bound. This game also marks the first appearance of the dynamic ally Zero as well as the new "ride armor", which allows X to pilot a headless robot with huge arms and hands allowing him the ability to break stuff and access areas that the normal X couldn't.


And the plot?  It plays like a drama that Shakespeare himself would've wrote!  The love  scenes between the main character and the nun are especially moving,  because they are both bound by their religious beliefs and cannot be  lovers.  As you can imagine, after the character is turned into a vampire,  then it REALLY gets tragic.  Your character's life spans from 1100 A.D. to  the present.  Now I'm not going to give any more plots away. :)

Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those "other agents" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue.

How depressing, I'm so old.
And let's not forget the overrated soundtrack. The music is dull, repetitive, and juvenile and not in good way. It's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didn't even do this on the NES.
I never actually bought the game.  I was around 11 or 12 at the time, and $60 was hard to come up with.  But boy, we would rent it and made use of the WHOLE 72 hours we had it.  I'm 20 years old now, and being frustrated with today's gaming experience, I decided to take a trip down memory lane and finally buy Wave Race 64.  I hoped to experience some of the joy I did so many years ago.  I found it for $2.75 on ebay.  It's still a great game, but it was a little sad to play it again - to see the out-dated graphics and all.  I beat all the circuit classes in no time.  Also, the guys I used to play it with aren't around anymore.  Makes me yearn for the good ol' days. :*(
If you're familiar with the way Sonic 1 plays, then you know how to complete 99% of the controls in this game.  However, they added a critical improvement in Sonic 2, which is the spindash attack.  All you do is crouch down (holding the bottom d-pad) and hit the jump button to start spinning, and when you release both buttons to go much faster than without the spindash.  With the spindash, you can also plow into most Badniks and they'll get destroyed.

You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score.  The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title.

9817	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	While I am begging Capcom to reconsider the ground up remake for GameCube I think that it is safe to say that RE 2 Director's Cut Dual Shock whatever ediction is currently the definitive version of the game. The Aarange Mode makes this game slightly more interesteing than the original version, and while it makes it overly easy to play on Rookie mode nothing is more satifying than a rocket launcher with unlimited ammo. Especially on the B-sides when you're up agains the Tyrant who follows you arround like Nemisis does in RE 3, though not as much. The N64 version had garbled sound and grainey FMVs and was just not worth it, but did have one advantage over this version, the optional analogue control. Update the graphics, throw in analogue control and this game will be the best of the series again, but only if it keeps all the fun extras that this one has. This is the version I ended up settling for.
Gameplay A-
Lastly, Superman's powers are present here.  He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath.  That's always neat, huh?  But what's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel --- according to this game --- has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists.  He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky, and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis.  How cool is that?  On the other side of this spectrum, there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch......you know, I still haven't figured out how to beat those sections of the game.  I wonder, is there a higher power known only to Superman?  I ask, because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry.  The most gifted scientists, researchers, cryptologists, artists, and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.
For those in the know, this is Capcom in top form.


Lastly the story is fabulous.  It has some great supernatural influence, as well as classic detective work.
Cons
Super Star Wars is not an easy game, however.  While no where near as difficult as "The Empire Strikes Back" the game provides a good challenge nonetheless.  Many times you'll find yourself suffering from cheap deaths.  Some levels are also populated with dangers that will kill you in one hit.  To compensate the game has difficulty levels.  Easy, Brave and Jedi.  All of which are fairly challenging.

6383	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Being an ex soldier, I say that this game is more realistic, than operation flashpoint. #1- in df2 you don't have to shoot like hell in order to kill the enemy,#2 in df2 you are not going to charge in to the enemy like a fool, unless you are ready to commit suicide, you can use air strikes on a tank. I do believe it would be suicide to move in on a tank with satchel charges, if that tank is fully operational. I believe a tank can be laser targeted. So all in all think about it. Operation flashpoint is a good game, but some rough edges need to be smoothen out. Real soldiers would not commit themselves to such danger, and would not be asked to do so.
Ganondorf, the evil in the game, needs to get the tree spiritual stones to open the Tempe of Time. He threatened the people who have them, but they didn't give him the stones. Link goes on quests to get the tree stones. Once he gets them and Zelda, the princess, gives him the Ocarina of Time,  he opens the Temple of Time. But little does he know, Ganondorf followed him.
This whole opening sequence had me right where it wanted me. For the duration, I was this game's slave. I remember sitting in my chair and lifting a dazed look around my room after the disaster sequence. Like Keanu Reeves, all I could say was, "Whoa". I ended up played the game seven hours straight, an unprecedent time spend on one game by me.

9694	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is one of the GOOD versions of pokemon. You can take all sorts of different pictures. It's really cool because if you get them in a different pose, then you will get more points. Also the levels are very well made! The cave is really cool as the same with the jungle level. This game has some challenging parts to it though. Like when you have to take pictures of the pokemon statues. It's hard to find some of them.
Some good features: The game is clearly aimed for a mature  audience, although it has both a paintball mode to filter out the blood,  and a language filter, to keep out all that bloody swearing.
Also, save games are limited and you can't describe them at all. They simply list the character name and actual time - making it quite difficult for a multi-gamer household like mine to keep characters separated!

4063	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Half-Life is easily the best game ever made, no doubt about it.  The graphics are a little out dated but thats okay the gameplay more than makes up for it.  It isn't perfectly realistic but it comes very close to it.  For one, you can carry 8 weapons at a time but thats the case it most shooters.  And head shots don't kill.  But besides that the game is very realistic.  Guns are in logical places not just lying there as with health, health power-ups aren't just sitting there, instead you get health at refill pump which also are in very logical places.  Now as the plot goes, the most brilliant part in the game.  You are a scientist who works at Black Mesa Reseach Facility and are working on a very big project which goes very wrong, warping aliens to the lab.  Now the lab is infested with deadly aliens and you are the only one who can save you fellow scientists.  Wanna find out what happens?  THEN BUY THE GAME!!!
There isn't a single idea in this game that isn't founded on generic thinking, the thievery of other games, and on movie cliche's.  There isn't one single idea based in science fiction, unlike its other competitor, "Darklight Conflict," the true hero here, a little-known and original game released by Electronic Arts (EA) before "Colony Wars" was conceived.  "Darklight Conflict" was a space-shooter, and the gameplay idea for "Colony Wars" merely replicated that game.

"Super Mario World" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros.", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in "Super Mario Bros. 3"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in "Adventure Island II" and also the later game "Little Nemo: Dream Master". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]
5) GRAVITY WELL GENERATORS PISS ME OFF (You'll know what I'm talking about when you start playing this game online!) :)
And there's the humour. This game had me laughing out loud many times, quite a feat sonsidering the gory content of the game. Although gory, well, it's not for the fainthearted. Imagine having to push a corpse in an oven to be able to solve a puzzle... But is is always done with wit.
The second installment of the very popular Arcade smash Soul Blade, had much better graphics than the first, very fluid fights, new characters that rocked (and also a surprise cameo by Tekken's Yoshimitsu). Plus a lot of new weapons and fighting styles like a 3/4 staff, a sword with a chain attached to it, the Shaolin sword style and even some returing favorites like the short sword and Samurai sword.
9925	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Sega's Altered Beast is a video game classic!  When it came out in the arcade system, people would gleefully dump coins into the system to play as one of two resurrected Roman centurions in hopes of beating the nefarious Neff in the underworld as they rescue Zeus's daughter Athena from peril.  Regrettably, those who had the original Sega Master System were likely sorely disappointed with the disjointed and disorganized gameplay that the title had on that platform.  The resolution?  Sega released it on Sega Genesis, where it played better than it did in the arcade (let alone Sega Master System) and allowed players the ability to customize the game's difficulty (there were control options that could enable a person to award or remove lives and health bars, in addition to setting the game difficulty.)
3.  I hate video games that won't let you pause at certain moments, as this won't.  I wouldn't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who's gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen:  you'll find yourself saying, "Yeah, I'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour!  Not allowed to pause it for some reason!"

7467	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	okay, a Penny plus $3.99 shipping.  That's the cheap price i see right now on amazon for a used copy of this game....$4 bucks?!!  This is a Fantastic game!!  I know copies are plentiful, but Four Dollars?!?!  Okay, Majora's Mask was a game with a HUGE print.  But that commonly goes for over $20.  Wave Race is a Top Notch A+ Title!!  And it is yet to have a proper sequel.  The gameplay was amazing back then, and this is a N64 game i can still go back to that STILL blows my mind!  The wave mechanics are near perfect.  Especially for an early N64 title, 15 years later it STILL works!  Over ALL the many N64 games I love...I find myself casually coming back to this game for a quick game more than any other on the console.  And this is strange because i really don't play racing games.  What makes this enjoyable to me is the ability to do tricks and show off stunts when you don't have to.  In a 1-on-1 race, tricks don't add to your score.  But it's a TON of fun to speed past your opponent needlessly doing back flips off ramps & handstands through the finish line.  GREAT Game!  I'm fiendin' to play it right now!  Also the music is classic.  This game is an overall A triple zillion plus!!

as many other people have done, as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation, placed it in its case, placed in on a shelf behind my other cds, and it has not been touched ever since. this game was terrible, and i wish i had my 30 hours of gameplay back. i say instead of even thinking of buying this game, look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy 6 instead.
The story is the basic "Save the World" plot, but it has to grow into that story.  We take three characters who have no connection to each other: Jack, Rudy, Cecilia.  These three characters come together and get involved in a quest that with each step grows larger in scale and scope until it eventually builds into the "save the world" quest that we have come to know and love.  For the most part, the game feels like it is mission based.  You have to go someplace, fight, and return and find out where the next place you have to go and fight is.  I know, this is essentially any RPG (or video game, for that matter), but it just feels more like a mission based story than unraveling the story as you progress through the game.
You will get a good 70+ hours of gameplay.
I see kids today who look absolutely *determined* to forget about the Playstation 1 and 2 and buy whatever new video game console is cool these days.  Let me tell you something- back in the 90's, for at least four years, it was considered VERY cool to own a Playstation 1.  This is because game companies kept pumping out one wonderful game after another.
3719	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	To be quite honest, I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I've ever played. The narrative sequences are ridiculously long, the graphics are mediocre, and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed. I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it, and I was terribly disappointed.
448	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.
3578	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I hesitated to purchase this title because of the previous poor review.  I am truly sorry because this game "ROCKS!"  The opponents have personalities and adaptable driving styles.  They actually try to cut you  off and try to prevent you from passing.  Heads turn to look at you and the  smooth framerate pulls you into the action.  The graphics are fantastic and  the sheer inventory of cars to choose from is amazing.  Gameplay is  enjoyable and the ability to race against your opponent and win his car  makes this the my racing sim of choice.  Many times I have found myself  blurting out the words "YOU ARE WALKING HOM FROM THIS ONE" after  entering the final stretch of "High Stakes."  Running on a  PIII450 with 192MB RAM, 7200rpm ATA66, Voodoo3 3000, soundblaster live at  1024x768 using an MS Sidewinder there are no hesitations or  "cyberburps" in any way.  I have not encountered any problems  except understeering conditions which since I have never really driven the  cars in question, cannot be contributed to the game.  The incorporation of  the previous tracks along with the new will please the veteran NFS fan as  well as challenge them...they only picked the tricky ones.  I was lucky to  pick this game up for $14.88 in the markdown bin and would have paid more  if I had driven a demo prior to release.  This game is a must have if you  have the hardware to fully enjoy it and if not, it will look okay but must  be run at lower resolutions.
When playing the actual game, it's styled like a beat 'em up, but you don't actually beat..up anybody, although you can bounce on enemies' heads. Although the gameplay's very simple, it makes for exciting action! And on top of that, the graphics and sound are detailed, colorful, and amazing to look at. Plus, believe it or not, there's actually some slapstick funniness like in the show! For example, when encountering Dr. Scratch 'n Sniff, he jumps out of the window! And when venturing through the Adventure level, you'd knock over Buttons (the dog in the show that always ends up in harsh situations)!

The worst aspect of the game is how resources are  derived.  The game works on a system of "command points", whereby  you are rewared with the capability to purchase more resources when you are  succesful in combat.  This sounds like it might have been innovative, but  in this implementation what happens both in the single player and  multiplayer game is that the player (or computer) who wins early skirmishes  gets access to greater numbers of units and advancements, thus quickly  overwhelming their opponent.  This condition, where the outcome is decided  from the start and you've virtually no way to recover from an early falter,  causes frustration and represents to me poor design.

There are some things to really like about Dino Crisis.  At certian points during the game, you have to make decisions aka "Choose your own adventure" style (Do you investigate the underground area, or go save a comrade?).  This adds a nice touch of replay value.  The graphics are pretty good (By PS1 standards).  The best part of the game however, is the T-rex.  The T-rex provides the most exciting elements in the game, and each encounter is a adrenaline charged rush.  Likewise, the 4 possible different endings are all very exciting and cool to play through, although there are a few things I am curious about.  For example, (Spoiler!!!) how can a T-rex swim 30 miles an hour in water?  That dosent make much sense. (End Spoiler)
I bought 4 Copies of this game when it came out, I was THAT hooked to it I did not want to take a chance on losing it or having my disc damaged. I lost all but one and still play it to this day! If you have 100+ Bucks laying around do not hesitate buy this game now!!!
5816	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I just bought this game yesterday and it rocks. The CG look just like the ones from FF X. The only bad thing is the control in the game, But I still give it five stars. Cards are pretty fun except it starts to get more boring. I would Have to say this game isn't as good as FF X For PS2, which may I add is the best console out there,But it's really close.

  Overall, this game is surprisingly fun and amusing, and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG (role-playing game) lovers.  Great game, so if you like RPGs or adventure games, get this one, if you don't already have it.

7218	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This is one of the best and funnest ever Nintendo 64 game. This game is much better than James Bond 007. The object of the game is very fun and easy to learn. You go around and pick up different kinds of guns. It's not like in some games where you ahve the same lame old gun. There are simple shotguns or huge, sweet guns. You also go around picking up ammo. Then you walk around in a huge building with many doors, ladders, stairs and pipes to go through or cross to try and find you opponent and start shooting at them. Once you get killed you have to look for more sweet guns and ammo againw hich makes the game so much more challenging and funner. If you own James Bond I wouldn't say you should buy this game because it is basically the same, but if you are deciding between Bond Or Perfect Dark definitely get Perfecft Dark.

There is a strong puzzle solving element to this game (though not as bad as the block puzzles from WA2), but it was used effectively in Wild Arms.  The story was fairly interesting and the minor characters were fun to see pop up from time to time.  By the end of the game things started to get a little absurd, but this is a fun little game and it should not be overlooked due to age or graphical deficiencies.

The biggest stumbling block,  ironically, is also Pharaoh's greatest triumph: the accurate and detailed  process it takes to build monuments.  You don't just say "Oh, I wanna  build a pyramid" and plunk it down.  No, first you must build the  infrastructure; guilds must cut and lay stone, peasants must prepare the  build site and haul stone.

An annoying problem for the Nintendo 64  were that  in the earlier days of the arrival of the Nintendo 64 you would need to purchase controller packs to save your games,  fortunately later on they made it possible to save your game without a controller pack. Also, the rumble pack feature was annoying to. You would have to buy a rumble pack (if you want to feel vibrations during your game) which added to the weight of the controller. (They solved that problem when Nintendo made the GameCube`s rumble feature built into the controller.)
5103	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	"ADDICTIVE" is the one word that describes this game. If you love strategy and combat in a mystical setting then add this game to your collection. Beware because once you get this you will want the add-on,  Armaggedons Blade ASAP. As in Heroes 1 and 2 you must balance resources,  magic power and massing an army to win. The campaigns are a little weak in  comparison to Heroes 2 but Armaggedon's blade will more than make up for  it. The campaigns in Blade are very enjoyable. The addition of new heroes,  castles, and creatures makes the game a classic. If there could be a  fantasy strategy game of the decade this would be it.

Now for my review. The game has great levels fun platforms and for collecting diamonds are more fun and challenging to do (I never could collect em all). My most favorite levels are the cave of wonders and inside the genies lamp and the music was excellent for every level, But my slightest complaint was beating jafar at the end was such a piece of cake it wasn't even challenging.

What I find most interesting about this game are the variety of character classes allowed from which to select your character type and adding and removing team members. Sometimes deciding over this itself will take a lot of your time. The plot of the game looks great and its many twists n turns are quite shocking! Besides the main plot you also have many side quests. The graphics are very pretty and one look at the homes and Inn's cannot help but remind me of Dollhouses.
I could go on and on about the new aspects of HM64.
I really  loved the myriad of sub-quests in this game that you can run through or  avoid at your leisure, and also the fact that most of the experience points  earned in the game come from TALKING to people and discovering new things  instead of just bashing lots of monsters -- although there are plenty of  monsters to bash as well.

The second thing is something that I personally am disappointed by, which is the
Horrible alarm clock type noise when you are low on health
What soundtrack? It's just a bunch of clicks, screeches, and otherwise infuriating sounds. It's not music. It's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds, or your money back! GUARANTEED!
Instead of a classic, I found a game that was, well, kind of lazy. You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level, and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters. So, you have to spend your time getting all of DK's bananas and missing the other 4 characters' bananas, because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas, only Tiny can get Tiny coins, etc. This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.

The game's difficulty is subjectively easier than DKC 2 but perhaps harder than DKC 1.

5071	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Okay, I'll admit it. I got a little left behind at some point. I never was real into the first-person shooters like Doom or Quake. I just thought they  were somewhat mindless, and vastly preferred adventure and RPG type games  that had good plots and didn't rely so much on quick fingers and killing  people.
With a very long storyline, and if you don't have a strategy guide handy, there's a possibility that it might take a while to finish the game completely.

+the dark humor is spot on
Like the SNES version, this game includes 3 modes of play: GP (Grand Prix), Battle, and Time Trial. In GP you choose one of 8 characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Wario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup Star Cup, or Special Cup (which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses) in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc mode. 50cc is the easiest, but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging. There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race. Lightning bolts (the rarest item to get) makes all of the other opponents small, mushrooms give you a speed burst, banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it, red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course, and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers. Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game, there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course. In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them, snowmen that will blow up if you hit them, and many other obstacles in different courses.

The point of the game is to fight your way to the surface and make it out alive! but that is no easy challenge, for the alien AI is smart and the damage they can cause can be severe.you also fight soldiers trying to cover up the experiment and trying to eliminate all the witnesses. you will die many times, but somewhere inside you, you have the courage to keep on going. there are also many weapons to choose from in this game, but u must find them first. these are some examples (there are too many to list, ill just list the basics) MP5 submachine gun with a M203 grenade launcher on it, Glock pistol, Crowbar for wacking aliens, Rocket Launcher, Grenades, shotgun, crossbow, and trip bombs. there are many others too!!! this game is not only very hard, but very long. on easy mode it took me about 2 and a half months to beat it. that sounds crazy, but its worth it and soon you'll find yourself addicted and not being able to stop clicking the mouse button. i highly reccommed this game to all FPS addicts. A MUST HAVE!!! >>>>>>>>>

All in all these are great  games which can be played over and over (although only one game at a time  can be saved), and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of  fun.
9370	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Beavis and Butthead is a fun game you have to go around town and collect your gwar concert tickets that the next door neighbors dog chewed up take my word this game is awesome.
A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him. Be nice to your children. Buy them Crash 2. Or 3. Or games from the Spyro series, that would work too.
With a very simple design and set up like the previous 2 Nintendo consoles (SNES & NES) the 64 was another cartridge based Nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance (remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles?). The controller however, was something that was dramatically different from both previous Nintendo consoles. This controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard 2 or 4 buttons. The analog stick was great for the 3D games and made it very easy to navigate, however, after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or another.

the stoy line will have you hooked.
The graphics compared to today are very bad, however for it's time it could opf been considered revolutionary.  There was even one point where EGM put it up against the mighty Soul Caliber, possibly the greatest 3d fighter of them all, and best game on the Dreamcast.  Obviously Soul Caliber won but to even be put in the same league as it was a great honor.
GRAPHICS: Pretty good for an N64 game, the only other N64 game that had grat graphics was PERFECT DARK.
Well you get the idea.. its just a lot of new stuff.. :)
And even the graphics, which are nice, are loaded with  bugs.  In most cases, whenever an enemy would drop an item, the background  would spring 'holes' of black space around it and cause nemerous graphic  flaws until it would finally crash without explination.  Furthermore, some  enemies would become 'stuck' in some void on your screen preventing you  from being able to attack it!

But again, most of these complaints feel like nitpicks. I can see why this game has persisted on the top ten charts for two years, and I'm glad I got it as a sort of "antidote" to "Black and White". It doesn't ask you any deep philosophical questions, and it doesn't really challenge one's ideas about what computer games can be or do: It's just fun.
9300	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Max Payne is an addictive game, that has action bordering on insanity.  I must admit, when I busted out the bullet-time and took down 4 guys in a matter of seconds, it was the most fun I had had in quite a long time, in terms of computer games that is.  This ultra-stylish game begins with a gruesome murder, and then snowballs into a one man versus all killing rampage.  Slow-motion deaths, bullet-time, multitudes of weapons, gigantic explosions, and just about everything else is thrown into the mix.  I have a few problems with this game, first of all the stupid just plain embarassing dialogue.  "I don't know about angels, but it's fear that gives men wings" is typical of the tripe that max spews.  This all might be a huge joke, or just the game designers trying to stay within the conventions of film-noir with the constant voiceover, but I didn't find it funny.  The other problem is the wasted characters and simplistic plot.  A revenge plot is a simplistic plot to be sure, and I was embroiled throughout most of the gameplay, it's just when it's all done, the plot should have been a little more fleshed out.  The other thing that made me mad, (spoiler ahead) was the complete waste of a female character.  She shows up about midway through, and I thought she could be a nice counterpoint to Max.  Instead you never see her again, until she is murdered near the end.  I was more than a little peeved.  Anyway, it is definitely better than the crop of mediocrity currently occupying the online landscape.  It is short, but it is a game that has quite a lot of replay value due its numerous cool set-pieces.  All in all, a worthwhile buy and one that will satisfy despite its flaws.
Environment/Landscape:  Nova Logic did something with the Comanche series that nobody else ever did and still have yet to do with a helo sim:  TREES.  Longbow, Enemy Engaged, etc?  Yawn, snore.  I couldn't believe Longbow II was so terribly done.  Without trees and cool landscape items to hide behind, a helo sim is utterly worthless and completely deafeats the very purpose of being in a helo in the first place.  Once again, Noval Logic gets it right.  Trees, nooks, crannies, gullies, etc.  The best landscape a rotor jockey could ever hope for is found in Comanche Gold.  What good is sneaking around and flying nap-of-the-earth if you're still out in the open with no trees and gullies to zig-zag throgh?  You are even able to hide behind and between not only trees but BOULDERS in this game.  Comanche Gold is untouched by any other rival in this category - with the possible exception of Comanche 4.

7227	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I borrowed this game from a friend. I played for half an hour then got bored. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. It's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie(which I also didn't like). I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.
There are 2 modes.  Adventure\Explore where you go through the complex looking for the ones responsible.  And the other is battle mode.
The rest just gets back on the nerve train from there and as someone mentioned, the school house.  The school house it self is a nerve wrecking experience since it involves an empty place that used to have children in it... and the finger painting in blood on the walls, the hollow foot steps of shadow beings, and emptiness builds up another psychological tension.

While the graphics in Sonic 1 are impressive, Sonic 2 manages to improve upon this area as well.  There's better color arrangements to improve visual depth on the levels and backgrounds.  The finest example of this would be the Casino Night Zone.  The background in that level is absolutely beautiful and colorful, and makes you feel like you're in a "sanitized" version of Las Vegas.  The "industrial" themed levels like the Chemical Plant, Oil Ocean, Metropolis, and Death Egg Zones have improved from industrial-themed levels in Sonic 1 as well.  The architecture and atmospheres in these levels are much more serious-looking than in Sonic 1, and particularly with the Chemical Plant and Death Egg Zones, I think they perfectly exemplify the way a high-tech, industrial setting should look like.

Overall the game is well drawn with decent sound  and standard voice acting.  Many elements of the pencil and paper game a  found here, with some annoying omissions that will be fixed in the next  installment.  These were the low experience cap and inability to distribute  weapon slots towards two-weapon style, to name a couple.  At any rate, the  game is LOADED with sub-quests and days of good solid gameplay.  Black Isle  is on a roll.

Thief 2 and Swat 3 have been worthy purchases and I was so glad the see the best FPS game of the year so far............SOF. The best FPS since Unreal  Tournment some months ago this game is shades of Kingpin and Goldeneye.  Unlike Kingpin though if you took away the gore this will still be a  brilliant game. Its not the gore that makes it (altough its pervsersly  enjoyable). The story line is good, took me about 12 hours gaming time to  complete and the levels are VERY varied. From snow to desert to New York  city it doesn't get boring. There are cut scenes rather than the free  flowing storylines of Half LIfe and System Shock 2 but great weapons and  great graphics/gameplay make this a worthy purchace. Excellant training to  get you going, brilliant sniper rifle, abilty to lean round corners,  ability to shoot and cut limbs of dead opponants. Not for the fiant hearted  but brilliand none the less.

9626	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Folks, I have played em all. And I can tell you that Soldier of Fortune is one of a kind. Some may disagree with me, but I say that it's the first realistic first person shooter next to maybe half life. I love the fact  that if you shoot a guy in the leg, he hops around on one leg, and head  shots are automatic death. I love the fact that when you cut a guy, there  are actual slice marks and not bullet holes or nothing at all. I love the  fact that there are 'actual' weapons to choose from instead.. say.. a worm  shooter made out of an alien's spleen. Not to mention the great story line.  When I look at a game like this compared to say, Quake 3.. I think, 'Why am  I so bored with Quake3?' The reason is this.. Quake 3's single player  stinks... If you want to enjoy it and many other games like it, you need a  cable modem and play a decent deathmatch. However, Soldier of Fortune's  single player mode was very well thought out with a planned storyline. The  effect and suspense that the levels create is sometimes spooky... I am  always catching myself tilting or moving my head so I can try to peek  around that corner so I can see the bad guy, and then jumping when he  appears behind me. If you want a game that doesn't require a cable modem to  enjoy the game, soldier of fortune is a good bet.

3580	Video_Games_5	NEG	1.0	I don't mind if the graphics aren't completely state of the art, but this was ridiculous.  Not only were the graphics terrible, but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible.  I  ran this game on a P3-733Mhz with a DDR GeFORCE256 video card and could not  enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you  would receive depending upon where in the track you were.  Terrible.  Even  at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish.  I-76, which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill NS4.  I am unbelievably dissapointed.

Alpha series brought modernisation AND super-attack option, which you can use when your super meter is up.
+ The Sega Dreamcasts design is awesome.. very compact... has four controller hook ups right out of the box.. a 56K modem to get on the Internet(This was the first system in which major consoles took Internet play seriously 56K was good for the time) and runs off GD's (Which I believe means Gigabyte Disc which is basically a CD dual layered that stores over a Gig worth of memory on it) it also comes with a memory card out of the box.. which goes into the controller..
In order for the game to be rewarding, though, it requires patience, along with nerves of steel and an iron stomach. The game starts out with a bang (or a bunch of dead, moaning, faceless knife weilding babies stabbing you to death within 3 minutes of play, I guess that counts as a bang, right?) This is misleading, though, as the game then calms down considerably for about the next 45 minutes of game time. Before we go on, though, two things: 1) The graphics are fairly blocky, but, for reasons that will become apparent, this doesn't matter. They're well textured, which is much more important. 2) The sound is PHENOMINAL. Always bear this in mind.
8/10 Graphics (Especially for a 1998 Gameboy game)
I am almost absolutely certain that any Star Trek fan would love this game. Even if you finish the game once, you'd still wanna play it again. If you get bored of that, then you'll end up downloading all the maps provided on Elite Force fan sites...every day it's something new in those sites. I'd definitely recommend this game to Trekkers out there, regardless of whether or not you like 3D shooters or not. The demo is not enough, trust me.


Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )

The things I like about it are that there are many different types of games like action, sports, racing, puzzle, adventure, and more! I also like the graphics when you are playing the games, even though the screen is very small, you still get a lot of detail. And I like the fact that the screen is in color. There is even a jack where you can plug in a little light so if you are playing in the dark, you can see what you are doing. Some of the best games on Game Boy Color are Monopoly, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest, All Star Baseball 2000, Pokemon Pinball and Tetris DX. I also like the fact that there is a very wide selection of games to choose from, which makes for more variety.

9029	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Before this game came out in the 90's I remember seeing a video about it.  I knew I had to have it, and bought it immediately upon release.  The graphics were absolutely stunning, and are even pretty good by today's standards.  The storyline was great and the characters instant classics.  And so when I got my Wii one of the first things I did was download this game--one of the best I've ever played in over 20 years of gaming.

The stand-out elements are the  excellent, shadowy level designs, and the spooky, tense atmosphere. Your  character is no good at fighting, and you have to sneak around behind  people who might turn around at any minute, often in dark rooms, sometimes  in haunted caverns. Imagine a really scary ghost story, crossed with the  tension of bomb disposal, and you're there. The level design is highly  original - the level set in a giant sarcophagous, in which you turn corners  to find yourself face-to-face with large, gas-breathing dinosaurs, is an  all-time classic.

The Dragon Realms are a peaceful place, full of artists and dreamers and crafters, and they pride themselves on their beautiful gems. While some dragons are being interviewed about their world, the long banished Gnasty Gnorc overhears some less than positive comments about himself. In retaliation, he turns all of the dragon's beautiful gems (which reflect his face back at him) into Gnorc minions, and freezes the dragons in crystal prisons. All, that is, except one short little purple firebreather, who becomes the hero by taking it upon himself to defeat the Gnorcs and free all the dragons.

The graphic isn't that great, but it's okay shot. The battle system isn't that great, but they gave it a shot. The gameplay has no reply value, but they gave it a shot again. All in all this would be a 1 star game on any other system, but the N64. And, maybe that's why it's only for N64.

Dozens  of games later I can honestly say this game was well worth the 49$ I had  paid and at the current price of 19.99$ it's a real deal. The game isn't a  departure from Civ II in anyway and may fall short of other's expectations  when they are anticipating Civ III but with any amount of game play they  will be pleased. Is it the same game? Basically yes. Are there THAT many  improvements? No. Is it better than Civ II? Yes. Just the little things  like unit customization, new techs, new races, improved network play, etc.  make it worth it in my book. I've had the game since it was released and  still play on occasion and most likely will still play a year from now. If  you approach this game not expecting it to be a huge breakthrough in the  Civ series, then you won't be disappointed.

Most of Black Isle's games were really good, but Planescape: Torment is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The lush gameworld, the extraordinarily intricate character interaction, and the terrific plot are all things that we have seen before and are likely to see again.  But, Planescape leaves you with something even more than a pleasant gaming experience; it leaves you with an entirely new perspective on life.  Without being brazen about it, Planescape demonstrates that tiny actions, miniscule decisions can change the nature of the universe; it also shows the affects of what I believe to be the most painful emotion within the human experience, regret.  At the same time as all this, Planescape is successful at being a remarkably good game, and it isn't preachy at all (in case you're worried that philosophy will override entertainment).

7299	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Let me just say this. Out of all racing games I've played for the Nintendo 64, only Diddy Kong Racing and Mario Kart 64 are more fun. Okay. With that said, let's explore the various components of gameplay in a random, unorganized order. What I found really compelling is the awe-inspiring cast of characters. 30 racers, each with their own personality and life story, is quite a hefty amount. Another thing this game excelled in was the sense of SPEED! While Star Wars Episode I Racer went just as fast if not faster, that game didn't present you with the sense of speed F-Zero X does! Sometimes it can get overwhelming, and that sends you flying off the track, where (if you're playing multiplayer) allows you play a rather fun slots game in which you can still affect the action on screen. The ability to completely wipe out opposing racers with a slight double press of R or Z really adds great strategy in the single-player mode. And Death Race. Oooh...that is a classic!  Tracks are well-designed. Boosts. You won't win without them. They can get quite annoying, since if you miss one, you're pretty much screwed, at least in multiplayer. Single player AI is pretty dumb.

Some of the stages play like proper old school platformers, but this game was in the first wave of proper 3D, and it's a strong example.
OVERALL GRADE: A+
The storyline is the most complex and most detailed of any video game that was released at that point. There are tons of cut scenes, character dialogues and we didn't see a game like this back then. The story takes place in 2005, about six years after the events of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake and 10 years after the events of the first Metal Gear. A genetically enhanced Special Forces unit called FOXHOUND has invaded a nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses island in Alaskas Fox Archipelago. The forces demand that the U.S. government turn over the remains of Big Boss within 24 hours or they will launch a nuclear weapon. Big Boss was the main antagonist in the first two Metal Gear games who is one of the greatest soldiers who ever lived. The terrorists want the body so they can take his genes and put them inside the soldiers so they can become an army of super soldiers and take over the world. The main hero Solid Snake is forced out of retirement and is sent to go to the island and stop the threat. I won't say anything else about the story because my reviews are always spoiler free, you have to play the game to see it for yourself.

4567	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	THPS is one of those games that you can't stop playing for weeks.  I remember the first day that I bought it, I played until midnight and then remembered I had to go to school the next day and stopped.  That day I couldn't learn, I just was thinking about playing the game.  Finally, 287 hours later, the bell rang and I ran home. I didn't do my homework, told my mom that I didn't have any, got some popcorn, soda and chips, and went to my room and played the game until midnight again, the same thing happened all week.  The reason for this happens is simple, the game is near perfect, no wait, I'll re-frase, it IS PERFECT!  The graphics are good, tricks are very well-done, levels are all fun, the pros you can be are good choices, and the soundtrack is so wicked awesome.  I also think that the plot was good, and how many sports games have plots? Yeah, like NONE!  And when you beat the game, instead of saying, "Okay, what do I do know?" you say something like "Whew! that was sick! I want to go and check out that huge gap in the Downhill Jam level."
2960	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I have been a fan of The Final Fantasy Series since it first came to the US for the NES.  This is yet another great game in the series.  It has great graphics for its time.  It has a very involving story with a lot of plot turns and it has a lot of likable characters that you actually would like to learn more about as the story unfolds.  I would recommend this game for anyone that is into sci-fi, fantasy and RPGs.
Controls: 5/5
You also have "relics" that you either find lying around or get from defeating bosses.  These relics help Alucard out and enhance his abilities.  You can use some relics to help you turn into a Wolf, turn into a bat or a cloud of mist. There is also a relic that lets you summon an ally known as a "Familiar" by your side.
As I said before, I received this game sometime when it first came out, and it is still fun to play 13 years later. If you like the Super Mario games like I do, I recommend this to you.
But there's a big problem with it: DESIGN
- and the characters are completely interchangeable. You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl.  And then the next battle, completely flip it around, so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer.  And then flip it again!  No individuality. Each character is identical.  Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting... not realistic at all.

The plot is basically Sonic 3 continued,with Sonic and Knuckles looking for the lost Chaos Emeralds. However,Dr. Eggman is looking for them too,so he can use their power to fly the Death Egg. The graphics are noticably better,and playing as Knuckles is fun beyond belief. The music is awesome,with some tunes that you are glad stick in your head. Overall,this was definetly the last good Sonic Genesis game. This was Sonic in his last 2D triumph.
Combat is a standard six-character front-and-back row affair, completely turn-based. Most magic spells and abilities are rune-based, while most runes can be bought en masse and assigned to virtually any character. This simple, functional arrangment makes for interesting strategies and fun boss battles, but during the frequent random encounters the routine of selecting "Attack" six times in a row can drive the player up a wall.

It combines classic Castlevania gameplay with RPG elements, such as the use of magic, and level points system, and a deeper storyline. Also adding to the depth is the use of money, relics that give special abilities, and a wider variety of weapons. The ability to equip weapons of your choice is a first for the series. By far the coolest is the ability to transform, you can be a bat, a wolf, or fog (!). The main character is Alucard (spell it backwards), who older gamers might remember from Castlevania 3 for NES. You meed a wide array of characters, some good, some bad, throughout your journey through Dracula's castle. The object of the game: same as the rest-find and destroy Dracula and end the vampire bloodline.

The game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock. Despite not having any other areas to go to outside of Princess Peach's castle there are tons of areas inside. Getting to new areas is simple. You need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors, and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors. Overall, there are 120 stars in the entire game and I would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is.

The levels are interesting and sparse ( i beat this game with the  Nintendo Power guidebook) and should take some time to crack the puzzles.  Basically, the game is quite easy and not surprisingly, it has enough  mini-quests and puzzles to keep you occupied.

To sum it up.

Speaking of kremlings, let's run through the bestiary.  From hopping kremlings to invincible zingers (bees), the enemy range is very wide; each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses.  One particualr kremling dual-wields two swords, and is only vulnerable when he gets them stuck in the ground.  There are also different colored variations of enemies; the pink version of this kremling has his swirds stuck in the ground for a much shorter amount of time, so it's tougher to kill him.

Unless you have never played a video game before in your life, there will be little if any difficulty completing this one.

By God to really even explain how great this game really is is difficult for me.

In Battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters. You drive around a course trying to pop each other's 3 balloons. You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip. You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them. Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players. This mode is a lot of fun, especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode.

There are two points that must be noted.  First, this game is very hard.  I know a friend who downloaded a patch to make Rayman invincible... and he still couldn't finish it.  Also, there is no in-game save-game feature.  You can only save after a level.  Although most levels are "bite size" so you don't lose much progress if you lose, there are numerous occasions that a particularly difficult scenario would require you to march through the same terrain again, and again, and again.
8200	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Great condition


The BAD: Except for the training mode and the bonus content, Rare didn't add anything else so what you see is what you get. While Gargos himself can be unlocked, this game has only 11 fighters to choose so it's a bit light compared to fighting games today. Also, some of the characters from the first game had the controls for their moves and combos totally changed so you will have to re-learn them all if you intend to use them.
For a game that is over ten years old the graphics in Final Fantasy still impress. Though I'll admit that graphics aren't really a top priority to me. Typical for a PS1 era game, FFVIII uses pre-rendered backgrounds with polygonal character models. The backgrounds look mostly great though the character models definitely show the games age. Still the models are a huge improvement over those used in FFVII. Square has always been known for their great CG movie sequences and FFVIII displays the developers masterful competence at creating short but moving CG sequences. Throughout the 4-disc adventure you'll be treated to a wide variety of jaw-dropping CG sequences that help move the story along.

As others have said, the buttons are actually ok, but the d-pad will drive you insane. Rage quit-inducing. Don't bother, go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual, old SNES controller.

AMBER is a slide show game in the style of MYST, but I didn't miss the 3-d presentation or 360 degree vision of more recent games.  Navigation was generally pretty easy, although there were one or two places where I had a hard time getting to where I wanted to go.  One ghost world utilised a special diagonal cursor that was very hard to understand;  another featured a view of the world that was pretty distorted (in more ways than one).  Again, in these spots patience was necessary.  Also, the screen size is small.  Setting my monitor to 640 X 480 helped some, but I, at least, found I had to do that manually before playing;  the game doesn't do it for you as most do.

9252	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Its plot is cliche, the gameplay is almost like a dumbed down version of Secret of Mana, it can be very grindy at times, its music is forgettable, and it's only meant for 1 player. Despite all of that, I absolutely LOVE this game! I can't tell exactly what it is about this game that made me fall in love with it so much. It's by no means original, and it's definitely not for everyone, but this is one of my favorite SNES games of all time. One thing I think this game does brilliantly is its use of ambience. No other SNES game has perfected that aspect like Secret of Evermore has. In fact, the ambience is done so well in this game, it even rivals some of today's games in this aspect.  From the moment you boot up the game, to the time it ends, you really feel completely engrossed in this world like you actually are the character you play, lost in a big unfamiliar world. Exploration is a key factor of gameplay as it is very fun to explore every nook and cranny the game has to offer. There are few things in video games that I love more than being dropped in the middle of a foreign land and figuring out the directions on my own. Because of this, the soundtrack is filled mostly with ambient noise rather than actual music tracks, but combined with the world you run around in, this works beautifully.
Graphics:
-Since this is technically the other half of Sonic 3, THERE ISN'T A WHOLE LOT OF NEW STUFF FOR SONIC'S ADVENTURE. Pretty much Sonic has all the same attacks, animations, and powerups as in Sonic 3, and now with Tails gone, his reaching abilities are hindered. His absence is fixed, however, by locking it onto Sonic 3.

You have a kid that loves horror games and movies, give them this. Sure, they may complain about the graphics, but after a little while, they will not be able to tell the difference. In a few moments the game will be playing them, getting into their head and messing with them as they try to dig deeper into the game. Yeah... it's that kind of game. YOu do not play this game, it plays you.
I've been playing RTS games since 1997, and in my opinion, this is  the best one ever made. No one has made one that's as fun, has as gripping  a storyline and artwork, or depth and replayability of gameplay. It's a  work of genius. I've had it for two years and I still play it at least a  couple of times a week. There's even one mission left that I haven't  managed to conquer without cheating, so the challenge is definitely  there.

The storyline is simple and straightforward, not World Fantasy Award-winning material by any stretch of the imagination. This simplicity is a good thing though as it makes the game more accessible to those who just want to run around with a sword instead of reading page after page of text.
My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this "demon sword wielding" game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game. What sick minds came up with this anyway?
Personally, I'd skip this one anyday and go straight to MK II because that was just all out better than MK and it was a lot more enjoyable, had better replay and a lot more characters. Trust me, skip MK on SNES and go straight for MK II on SNES.

All in all, the game is great. I have been playing it and it is so cool. Keep in mind, it does get tiresome if you keep dying and have to start from the same checkpoint over and over, so be sure to hit the checkpoints.
  Well, speaking of dialogue, the grammar is also very bad...and I mean VERY bad. Examples are: (when you pick up the 1st floor map)  "You got the 1st floor map"  RE2 says "you've taken the 1st floor map" that makes more sense.  "You got the acid rounds"...funny sometimes. Also, what I found is that Jill doesn't know what blood is. Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor. Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask "What is it?" and she stays there and studies it...??? Barry replies with "I THINK it is blood. I hope this is not Chris's blood!"  And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times. But when there is a big monster coming they just talk "wow. its a monster. what do we do?"  and when there is like a door that doesnt open (during movie scenes) they say "THIS DOOR WONT OPEN!! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??" Also, a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself, and Barry replies "No that's okay...I have THIS!!!" And holds up his Magnum...I laughed my head off...he sounded so stupid! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny!

Awesome.  oh and...I couldn't care less about the lack of varity in the UT  skins, they still look awesome.
Being curious usually pays with sweet bonus items, story is really good considering it is a fantasy game with goth elements, and what are you waiting for? GO GET IT!!! I didn't have than much fun since first Metal Gear Solid I ever played!!!

  Cons: Boringly Hard Story Mode
Overall, this game is awesome. It gave me a sense of just being inside the B-17 anticipating and waiting for the coming "storm" when flaks and enemy fighters start coming at you.
The fighting in Killer Instinct is even worse than in Mortal Kombat, and I didn't think it was possible to defeat Mortal Kombat in sheer crappiness.  The one thing Killer Instinct does better than MK is the combo system.  It's easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game.  Unfortunately, just like Mortal Kombat, the fighting system is severely dated and useless by todays standards.  Unless you like your fighting games to be in slow-motion along with neverending choppy graphics (with bad-looking fatalities included for additional pain- pain that YOU feel) you should never ever think about buying this game.  Just another Super NES fighting game I hope people can't remember.

9046	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I loved this game it had Donkey Kong always beating on his chest and doing loud noises everytime when you make him stop, and Donkey Knog Jr. would scratch his head. In this game when one monkey gets hit in order to get your partner you have to find a barrel inside would be a monkey screeming to be let out so you grab it drow it on the ground break it then your partner comes back. I like it when you choose which person you want to use and I mean while during your playing all you do is tag team. This game has a lot of scary rides like that rollar coster or being shot out of shotting barrels while it's a snow storm. And the giant bee's you have to dodge them or hit thim with a barrel.
 The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls, Crash can now slide across the ground, perform a body slam, crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places. Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice. The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems. But whats nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game. A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact, but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck. The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes, extra lives and even gems.

The  skill tree is also insanely expanded, with unique skills for each class.  There are so many skills, you need to pick a few to specialize in so that  you can rock with them when the time comes! Spread your skill points too  thin, and you'll be kinda good at too many things, and not good enough at  anything.
Only con is: Some stuff is so frickin cryptic!! You have to look at a guide or you will miss many things while playing. I spend half my time playing with my head in a guide.
In addition to the regular storyline, there are some alternative options including "Extreme Battle Mode", which removes the plot elements and just lets you kill away, and a few bennies which can only be obtained by meeting certain standards, and which allow you to add new weapons and change your character's getups.

If I had any complaints about this game its the fact that the graphics while amazing back in 1997 look a bit dated in 2014 which while some of the other final fantasys might look a little jagged around the edges but the have aged better. Which isn't the games fought or nothing given that company's where still getting the foot on the ground in the whole 3d fad in 1997, but it might turn off other players. Everyone kinda has a legoie look to them. In the battle scenes however are really detailed and graphically hold up today. Now for the music 90% of the games soundtrack is amazing for a psx game its highly catchy and without the music I doubt the game would have been quite as popular as it is today. With that being said there is a few tracks in the game that are hard to listen to but most of it is great.

The story is typical FF-caliber.  Except Square ventured into an area rarely ventured into except by Atlus.  Corruption of the church and nobility is the primary theme.  It may seem like one person's intention to run amok on the country, but is he being manipulated by higher forces, for example.  There are so many names and events in this game that the game has a "Brave Story" function that lists people you've met or heard about, including an option to replay the different scenes you have encountered.  So if you drop the game and pick it up 4 months later you can browse through the Brave Story to catch up.  But the story is flat out great, very original, and extremely innovative.

Another huge problem is the incredible amount of mini games.  With so many it basically feels like you're playing a party game instead of an adventure.  To make matters worse, many of these mini games are inconsistent in challenge.  Some will be really easy and childish, while others will be head-scratchingly difficult.  Any ride, slide or race level is guaranteed to give you a tough time for quite a while and don't assume you'll be able to complete them with ease either unless you're a man or woman of absolute patience.  Not really fond of the games that involve launching from one barrel into another in a 3D view which proves to be less fun and more tedious than in the DKC series due to required near perfect timing.  There's so many games I can't possibly list them all.  A game inside a pointy rotating ice maze is the biggest nightmare ever though.  The many alligator shooting mini games located inside the bottom of a huge barrel however are really good.  The arena games that involve jumping on the heads of constantly spawning foes until time expires are sort of fun but can be VERY difficult- one slip up and down you go off the arena floor and into a black pit.  I'd say at least half of the bonus games are either inside an arena (with a booing audience!) or a top-down view of inside a barrel which is like an imitation of an arena.

5796	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	First I just have to say that I love this game. LOVE it. The plot is very interesting, I think it's probably the best one yet. My only complaint is that in most of the levels you need to get certain artifacts that you must have later in the game. It might be a little better if you can't exit the level without it, but you can so you'll never know that you need that artifact until you're frustrated with yourself three levels later unable to move forward in the game. So save often, look everywhere before proceeding, and if you don't trust yourself I would suggest getting a walkthrough. At least just to read over and make sure you got everything. Despite that, as I said it's my favorite of the Tomb Raider series. The quality is wonderful, her selection of weapons is great, and it's extremely addicting.

Liberty City's bordered by the Garden State of New Guernsey based on the Garden State of New Jersey!  Very decent graphics by 1997 standards!  Realistic car controls!  Realistic gun fights!  No so realistic fist fights.  Good music!  There are 2 more cities to unlock such as the unidentified city in the Golden State of San Andreas based on San Francisco, California and Vice City in the Sunshine State of Florida based on Miami, Florda!

7579	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I love this game. I haven't bought any of the other Shadows of the Empire stuff (novel, comic book, etc.), but you don't need them to enjoy the game. The story lacked some details which I assume are included in the book, but not so many that I felt lost. The cinematics struck me as looking a little dated even then, but the graphics when you're actually playing are pretty good. The levels are expansive without feeling too sparsely populated/decorated, as any Star Wars game should be. The game really encourages exploration. It's really challenging from beginning to end, which in my opinion makes it so much more rewarding when you finally do finish it.

Being the initial release title, usually bundled with the SNES until the release of the second model, there's virtually no one who owns a SNES who doesn't have a copy of this game.

7507	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	R6:RS is one of the best FPS games out there admit some real compition in the genre. The graphics are very good, oddly it did not make use of all the shading effects possible. It also sports some really good voice acting in the briefing missions. The game play is awsome, the AI is almost perfect. While most of the tangos simply stand around their reaction to your team is very real and intelligent. However too often I would step through a door way and get killed-only my squad did not notice, they would contiue to the waypoint. Even if the tangos are in the path of the waypoint your teammates can get cut down fast if one of them does not have clear LOS. While the enemy AI is so good, it is starnge the friendly AI is a notch or two below but still better than the first R6. There are lots of little things that are cool, there is extreme attension to detail here. I really liked seeing the charactors breath and see their breath in the air! The weapon selection is really big, but only a couple of the weapons will you use. The AI is so sensitive to sound that to use something with out a silencer is asking for failure. Most of the weapons are too loud to use on most of the missions so they are basicly useless in single player. Also how each weapon sounds is very authentic and I loved to hear the SMGs just firing away! A new feature are the snipers, while this is good to use they have the same problem as above, the sniper rifles are too loud. I gave my snipers the MP5SD5 rather than the rifles they were supposed to use and it still works rather well. The learning curve is sharp, and much of the planning phase is worthless till you have played the mission a few times to understand the map. However it pays to have a good plan, and that is what really wins the game is good planning. It is extremely rewarding to see your plan work perfectly.

I would also strongly recommend poking around on Steam's website for something called the Half-Life high-definition pack. It's a pack you can get and easily install from Steam's official website that significantly enhances the graphics in these old Half-Life games. Though I can't remember for sure, I think they make it easy for you with auto-installation.
Planetscape has improved markedly over its  predecessor. The most obvious difference is in its User Interface. You can  access items, inventory and spells using the main interface. In battle, you  can access each character's spells or items by right-clicking each  character.

It's and excellent and entertaining game, and by no means should be passed up.

3887	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	When buying a Game Shark to use with certain games you should keep a few things in mind. For one this is kind of "cheating" when playing a game. So if you're playing a really complicated game and you're telling people, "Oh yeah, I beat that game in like two days." But you were also invincible and had unlimited ammo, it's not as much to brag about as someone who used no cheats and beat it in three or four days. On the flipside video games are supposed to be entertaining (don't mix 'entertaining' up with 'ruling your life', get out of the house every now and then). Anyway, they're supposed to be entertaining and there is nothing entertaining about playing the same level 50 times in one week trying to figure out how the hell you get on the other side of this wall to flip the switch to open the door you're stuck behind and have to get through in order to get the switch and blah blah blah. You know, THAT whole bit. Using a Game Shark can let help you get through so you could later one day play the game without any cheats and when you run into a wall you can be like, "Heh heh, BLOW IT UP!!" or.... you know.... whatever it is you figured out with the Game Shark. It can also help make games that are too challenging for you, and make them easier for you. Different people have different ideas of entertainment. Some like a challenge and some just like to blow things up or walk into a building of about 30 or 40 people and take them all out without getting a scratch on them. Whether you love or hate them, I think everyone owns one or two at one point in their gaming phase. I know I thought they were lame and just taking the easy way out but I have one for my Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advanced. I don't have much time to play video games like I did when I was younger but when I do get the time to pick one up I want to be entertained. Some days I like a challenge and other days I just wanna fly through a few levels real quick just to pass the time and actually have gotten somewhere.

The game takes you through several stages, including the city, a ball park, a beach, and a factory just to name a few. The object is to navigate the stages by beating up enemies that come onto the screen. You do so by pressing the buttons that correspond with kicking, jumping as well as a special button. Each character has a special set of special moves and move sets. As an example, If you walk up to an enemy, you are able to grab them and perform a move, jump over them where you can slam the enemy, flip the enemy, kick, head butt, all depending on what character you are. These moves's damage all varies, as well as the speed and window of time allowed to perform different moves creates a lot of variation in play style with every encounter.

AOK's real strength, though, is like that of its  predecessor:  the game's extreme playability over network.  I heard that  AOE was the most popular network game ever, and there's no reason AOK won't  follow in its footsteps.  This is GREAT stuff to play in real time with  others.  Be warned, though:  players in Microsoft's Gaming Room are  ruthless to the novice.  Don't even think about going online until you've  gained a level of proficiency playing by your own.  And take the time to  learn the keyboard shortcuts:  you'll need the time it saves.
Having 4 players instead of 2 add up to the fun that you would probably have when playing games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Mario Party, and Goldeneye 007.

4564	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The original Tony Hawk Pro Skater was a surprise hit for Activision when it was originally released for the Playstation because it was unlike any other skating game before it.  Other games with skateboarding like Sony's Xtreme series (2Xtreme, 3Xtreme, etc...) incorporated skateboarding, but the results were lackluster at best.  What made Tony Hawk go above and beyond your average extreme sports games was that there was an added realism incorporated with easy to pull moves and tricks that rounded out a real fun package.  This game was revolutionary at its time, and it spawned two sequels that topped the original, and a host of imitators that still can't match the original Tony Hawk.  The soundtrack is worth noting as well; Primus, Dead Kennedys, Suicidal Tendencies, and the Suicide Machines lend some tracks making the game even more enjoyable.  If you have never played the original Tony Hawk, but have played the sequels, chances are you won't like this, but no matter how you look at it, the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater is a piece of modern video game history.

Finding all of the bonus areas will not be easy, however.  Some require you throw barrels at walls or take risk by diving into pits that may actually have a secret at the bottom.  Others require the use of animal buddies.  Yes, as in the first game, you'll find "animal buddies," to help you in some levels.  Familiar favorites such as Rambi the Rhino and Enguarde the swordfish return.  But now you've also got a rattle snake that can bounce, a spider and now Squawks the parrot does much more than just hold a flashlight.  Each animal buddy also has a unique thing they can do as well.  The spider, for instance, can fire webs, but can also use them to make platforms for you to jump on.  Rambi can charge at walls and open up secret passages or mow down enemies.  Like Dixie and Diddy's abilities they are essential to completing the game and finding everything.  You might find bonus areas this way, or you might find the infamous DK Hero Coins.

As I mentioned, the biggest strength of this game is the story. It is eerie, dark, humorous, creative, compelling, exciting, and unpredictable, all at the same time.  It gets interesting in the first scene and stays that way until the excellent ending.  It is supported with brilliantly written dialogue and elaborately painted characters.  Unlike most games, the dialog is one of the highlights of the game.  Each character that joins the main character is deep and contributes value to the story.  The story in most games is hit-or-miss.  This one was a home run.  It's too bad that there aren't more like it out there.
As far as plot goes this  game also hold up poorly to other games. It may start off fine but to avoid  revealing too much I'm just going to say by the second CD its going in a  bad direction and it doesn't turn around. Characters never get as  interesting as they were in FF7 and when you're on the third CD. (I think)  You well hit the one plot stop that leaves only the strong of heart to  actually bother finishing this sorry excuse for an RPG.
Over the years many games have come out that are about Star  Trek and have the facts, but they weren't really what people were looking  for.  Now after so long, a Star Trek game is now released that truly shows  how great this World is.  Star Trek - Armada is this game.  It is a Real  Time Strategy 3d game of the Star Trek universe.  It expresses it very  well.  You are able to pick up to 4 races... the Federation, the Klingon,  the Romulans, and the Borg.  Each race has about 10 special abilities and  their own units.  The story line of this game is very good and it clearly  shows an Expansion coming up.  This is definitly a game to put on your  must-buy list.

3205	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Forget any other reason for buying a Dreamcast -- Soul Calibur remains as the sole good reason for spending the money. It's worth the money, it's worth the money, and it's worth your time to check it out. You may have some trouble grabbing a copy of Soul Calibur, because every Dreamcast owner probably purchased this at the counter when picking up their system. Soul Calibur is the ultimate in fighting games - sleek, graphically unparalleled, and deep - and ranks as the best fighting game out there. It's set apart from its competitors by the double knockout of a great look and solid game play. Based on last years hit arcade game, and a sequel to the smash PlayStation hit, Soul Blade, Soul Calibur pits ten fighters against each other in a standard two-out-of three battle for supremacy. But might doesn't always make for right in this game. Soul Calibur is unprecedented in its game balance, with large, impressive bulky fighters on the same ground as small, fast players. The ten starting fighters are just that - a starting lineup. Through game play and advancement you'll uncover many cameo fighters, like Yoshimitsu from Tekken, and Seung Mina and Hwang from Soul Blade. There are also mystery stages and costume changes to uncover. Soul Calibur also offers many new options that the arcade version couldn't. Battle Mode, Team Battle, and Survival modes all lend the game an enormous replay value, while the sometimes complicated move system is helped out by a very thorough Practice mode that explains every move and shows you how to execute them. Graphically, the game evolves past its arcade counterpart in every respect, with incredible detail and superior polygon counts. Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast is without a doubt the best looking fighting game ever, with nuances like muscle rippling, facial expressions of pain, fear, and anger, and caustic lighting effects that dazzle the eyes. The game also excels in the area of sound, achieving what other games only dream of - the perfect balance of music, voice, and sound effects. Clashing swords, primal yelling, and blood-pumping heroic themes course through the game, all meshing for the perfect sonic mix. Namco has retooled the fighting dynamics so that both button-mashers and serious students of ass-whupping can both benefit and prosper in the game. Although novices can easily beat the game on easier settings, the game definitely favors those who understand Soul Calibur's complexities, like dodging, vertical and 8-way run attacks, and stagger blocking. Someone who has mastered the arcade game will find the differences in the moves trifling, while every one else will scarcely notice. What are you waiting for? Sonic can wait, TrickStyle will still be pulling tricks next week, and NFL 2K has a millenium ahead of it. There's no excuse for you not to be enjoying the best fighting game this year, and possibly the best ever. Power Stone and the laughable Mortal Kombat Gold can't touch the soul of this fighter, but you can.
A brilliant prequel to the Mario universe and a fantastic sequel to a timeless SNES classic! in this game you play Yoshi as you can jump to even devour enemies, not only that as you can collect 7 eggs to use them as weapons to shoot at enemies or objects that need to be shot. The music and graphics are totally exceptional with it's 2D beautiful that offers impressive stuff like the enemies which is unlike what Mario faced in the other games, this platformer is one of the best SNES games ever and if you haven't played it, i recommend you do find it or upload it and you'll be glad you did played it for it's a satisfying game.

7189	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This game, as stated above, is probably going to be the last great First-Person-Shooter on the N64. This game combines the graphics of half-life, the weapons of Turok 2, and the gameplay of Goldeneye to make a Perfect, yet a little dark, mix of all the great FPS's into one. Each level in this game, as in half-life, is completlty different from the last, and is archeiteched in a way that is totally conveincible, each one of the alien weapons has a feroicious, pointed look to it, and covered in a brown and red color, as in Turok 2, and the gameplay is almost the exact thing used for goldeneye, with a good lock-on system that slows you down for accuracy instead of being perfectly accurate while runnng franticaly for your life. Level design here is great, and each level has a high point of action to it that you've sworn you saw in a movie but just cant remember which one, for example, In the Area51 level, You walk into a white-walled autopsy room, disquied in you'r doctors uniform. Above you, on a raised platform, you see a bright, tilted surgery light, and below that, a short grey alien. All of a sudden, a guard yells "Thats not harry, its a Spy", everyone starts shooting at you, running franticaly behind cover, you return fire, staining the white walls with the red blood of the guards. You run into the autopsy room, take the floating cart the unconsious if not dead alien is on, and push it out of the room with one hand while carefully holding your trusty pistol in the other. As you open the door, two guards let loose with their AK's, as the cart below you bobbles up and down in the fight, you gladly return fire from cover of the cart the alein is on. Continually bobing up and down, the short grey thing remains unconsious as you push it from room to room, surviving each gunfight in the white and now red walled rooms. With such movielike action going on constinly throughout the game, and with such cool-looking guns, and great graphics for the N64, This game stands almost Perfect above the other N64 (I still thing Ocarina of Time stands higher, so don't but this over that, just to let you know)
I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple.
All joking aside, this a nice handheld console. Most people think of this as the very first color handheld console. But it wasn't. The first was actually the Atari Lynx(1989). This was released in 1998. Between them a few other color handheld gaming consoles existed. But this was the first color Nintendo handheld console! Which as you probably know Nintendo dominates the handheld market. The Gameboy color seems to be forgotten in past years because of the Advance's backwards compatibility. I don't know why though. This console should be trendy and hip. Think about it. It has a nice and colorful shell. It is nice to hold, and easy to carry around. Also it seems that a ton of parents skipped buying this for there kids because it was just a Gameboy with some color. So hear time and time again that this is the console they have always wanted to own. But never have.  So here are some reasons why you should own one even if you have an advance or SP.
This game is still very entertaining and challenging, it looks amazing, and sounds good in its own right. If you discount it as a Donkey Kong Country game, than you can appreciate it even more for the time it was made and the creativity of the developers. It was a flat yet valiant way to end such a memorable series. I'd like to see developers today do a better job with such limited technology and being overshadowed by another console at the same time. The game could have easily been better if they went about it differently. Perhaps if they built more accurately upon DKC2 and stuck to the originals formula more closely it could have been truly outstanding. We'll never know what could have been but what we have will satisfy gamers for a very long time.
Its graphics are undeniably nice.

The game features a few voice-overs, which are not TOO bad...they at least attempted to add a good degree of drama to the conversations.

Graphics are smooth and wondefully detailed (you can even see the enemies squint there eyes and bite there teeth together when they shoot at you).  Great voice acting and an unbelievably good story.
I end my spiel right here saying please buy this game and come join the ever growing community of Half-life. Who knows maybe I'll see one of you in-game. If you do see me, don't mind to say hi, most people that play are nice.

  I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.
One of Goldeneye's memorable features was the different guns from handguns, automatics, shotguns and even miniguns and rocket launchers. PD's weapons go a bit beyond that and you'll have stuff like CamSpy which is like a tiny motorized camera/spy vehicle to alien weaponry and things like night vision. It's easy to get into and it's fun to experiment though the more accurate precision of games like Halo or Bioshock kind of make it initially problematic to get used to.

Konami, as you could guess, can be counted to make great use of that 8 Megabit cart space; the programming gives us something that the Super Nintendo was hard pressed to do: move a ton of large sprites across the screen quickly and easily. The limited space has a drawback, though: if you're used to the modern masterpiece CV games on CD format (Symphony from 1997 and Rondo from 1993; even CastleVania Chronicles to a degree) you'll miss the great amount of interaction with the environment. That's simply a drawback inherent to many titles in this series. For over half a decade it has remained one of the last of the old "barebones gameplay" examples of CV, and likely will remain so unless Konami changes the formula after three GBA games (the as-yet unreleased AoS appears to follow the format of the Metroid-style CV). (And, a year later, I can say it did.)


 Very linear
Boss fights are Awesome and great since your fighting both Dr. Robotnik and Chaos and his transformed states.
You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.


The voice acting is decent at best, but certainly better than Resident Evil  (I grew up playing Resident Evil in case anyone is wondering why I so heavily compare the two games). I have not finished Silent Hill yet, playing for the last four or five days, and have only had to look at a walkthrough once for the piano puzzle, but all in all the game is very easy to figure out and navigate. It has high replay value from what I've read; giving you multiple endings and new opportunities on the second play-through.
6386	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Of course, it was a good game, fun, and even addictive.  Some interesting improvements include the more advanced AI of the enemies than was the case in the first "Delta Force".  It's also more realistic than the first one: i.e. hiding inside a canvas tent won't protect you from the cannon fire from a Hind.  Using several parachute sequences made it much more enjoyable and interesting.  A big problem, however, was that when you looked at your GPS map, you could still move you man but you couldn't turn his direction.  This proved to be a major irritation all throughout gameplay.  Furthermore, inclusion of a shotgun was nothing but absurd, unrealistic, and totally unnecessary.  Also, the manual and Help screens are very unclear on how to climb down ladders.  As the heading says, it was good, but by fixing only a few minor details they could have made it a lot better.

Also RCT allows you to do some very cool stuff with tunnels and bridges, but it's hard to patrol those areas. In an early game I ended up putting a roller-coaster very, very high up because of the way the terrain was, and I could =not= get mechanics to inspect the ride, resulting in the deaths of 16 poor little sims when the coaster suddenly flew off the track. (So much for that "Safest Park" award.)
The 1-Player Mode is a series of battles, like how fighting games usually are. Unfortunately, the rosters of the battles don't change.

There are these fish people named Zurros. They have this giant jellyfish named Mr. Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish-man! I think it was the Zurro king's pet and he lost it. But you have to carry it all around Mr. Jabba Jabba's stomach, so it's kinda annoying.
Why is it so ADDICTIVE? Simple. While playing, you constantly strive for the next achievement. "I'm just gonna play until I activate the waypoint for the Dark Woods...

The graphics are nothing special. The entire game is played from a top-down perspective, and your character's movement is a bit...odd, to say the least. Because the action is seen from the angle, moving in diagnals is the way to go. The character models are actually not that bad. They have this cute, beady-eyed look that is quite adorable. The music is very nice, but it is too short and as a result loops too often. Some people faulted the game for talking only in text. But you know what? Voice acting would have ruined it. Oh yeah. This is probably the only N64 with the descriptor "Alcohol Use".

4279	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Blizzard is one of those companies which toil away quietly only to release masterpiece after masterpiece. Real time strategy wasn't invented by Blizzard, instead they looked at what others had done and made  improvements, the end result was Warcraft, which was followed by the hugely  successful Starcraft in 1997, then the follow-up Brood War in 1998. They  have been assembled here in something called a Battlechest, which is  actually just a bigger box, but Battlechest sounds better. They also  include the strategy guides for both games, making it an excellent value  for the money given how routinely over priced strategy guides are.

 Another issue I had is that when you get a game over you start all the way to the beginning of the game. Extra lives are also hard to find. This wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't so bad.
3870	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	Worked pretty well.
Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game.
Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.
CONS: Facing the dragon seems quite impossible without getting a boost. I can never time it right.
2120	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is indeed what started it all. The graphics were great, considering its an early PSOne release. The storyline is a bit farfetched and predictable, but likeable (and face it, you've seen worse). The controls are extremely easy to work with, the missions are satisfactory, and you get to shoot ppl. What more do you want?
For it's time, it offered a fun battle system, great graphics, a good story, and clever, fun level design. One of the best games in the genre at the time, and rightfully so. It has taken a slight hit over the years, but overall, it has stood the test of time pretty well. RPG fans would be wise to not miss out on this. With the special package one, you get tons of extra goodies; well worth the money, although it's only possible to find it on sites like Ebay. If you find it, go for it. You will not be disappointed in the slightest at this classic RPG.

5405	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Midway. Being an old-school gamer, that name sounds familiar. I think they did lots of arcade games. If so, then they haven't lost their knack for making great games. When I went to the arcade, this was the one game that I really liked to play. Now it's home on Playstation, my favorite system. But what really makes this game stand out are several things: 1 - you FEEL like you're in Area 51. You walk outside among the F-16's, you walk inside the huge working areas, you walk around private offices, bashing down doors and searching the rooms. 2 - It's a shooter, but not like traditional first-person shooters. It's a whole breath of fresh air in that respect. Sure, you have to go where the game takes you, but it's fun. 3 - Maybe I'm going a bit too far, but this is really more of a prototype of Half-life. That's a good thing, not bad. Finally, let me point out that I haven't played the PS version, but I have played the arcade version extensively. As long as the two are alike and Midway didn't do something stupid in the translation--which I honestly doubt--then this game is an EASY 5 stars. Definitely one I'll be buying in the future, when I get the money.

The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much. Once more, I highly recommend this game.

Edit - I've had the controller for about a year, and everything is still smooth. Great controller, highly recommended due to its durability and responsiveness. If you've had one break, you need to learn to take care of your controllers better!
a new addition to the gameplay is the Guardian Forces (GF) which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term. these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game, as you need them to enhance health, strength, and so on, which i will get to in a moment. the guardian forces are the main attack force, and with these forces there is barely any need for the "attack" command (other than Zell's Duel limit break). The animations for guardian forces are well animated, but EXTREMELY long and tedious.
Released by Capcom in early 1996, Resident Evil was unlike any game we had ever seen at the time. With an opening title screen that explodes in blood and symbolizes terror, Resident Evil is a game that truly doesn't reveal itself right away. You have the opening story cinema scenes that vaguely explain your elite police officers' reason for venturing out into strange territory in search of your teammates. One of your teammates is killed during the investigation of the crashed helicopter by a strange canine beast of sorts, so the actors run for shelter in a spooky looking mansion.

The multiplayer modes are the reasons you keep on playing after you beat the main game. You can customize just about anything: the music, the number of players, the time limit, the kill limit, weapons you can use, the character you use (as well as the name and attributes), handicap settings and the number of simulants (the bot controlled characters) as well as the difficulty level and role of the simulants itself.

Final Fantasy VII gets a straight 5 out of 5 and deserves more for the bars they broke and limits they pushed. Not only that, but its characters are timeless and memorable, its story is amazing and emotional and the music is like none other for its time.
3078	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	It's been called everything from the greatest game of all time to the undeniable peak of an already legendary series. It's a big part of the reason Sony overtook Nintendo and ultimately won the 64-bit chapter of the console wars. And, truth be told, it's single handedly responsible for reviving a passion for video games that had lain dormant within me for years. So, cutting to the chase, is it worth the hype, does it really measure up to those previously mentioned, simplistic, cherished classics of the 8-bit era, can it really be as good as it's been portrayed? Well, yes and no. Final Fantasy VII is not the best game I've ever played, period. What it is... well, it's easily in the top five.

2952	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is a three disc rpg turn based game with the best storyline of it's time. It revolutionized gaming. It literally has weeks worth of playtime value being that you could sit down and play it for weeks on end straight through, non stop and still not do everything there is to do. I absolutely love this game. You find yourself spending so much time playing the characters , that you can't help but care about what happens next, which is a big kudos to the writers at SquareSoft no SquareEnix. They really know their stuff. I'm not going to say what the game is about, on the off chance that you've never played it. I would want to spoil it. I will say be prepared for long hours and late night snacks. I don't recommend this to anyone who works long hours at a job or around heavy machinery. You tend to daze off thinking about the game when you aren't playing.
Still, I think it is a fault to criticize the game too much (as many customer reviewers have) on issues of story line.  If you want a great, involved story, well, buy Planescape: Torment (my vote for greatest RPG title ever).  Even though Tales of the Sword Coast's game objectives may seem completely out of whack with the BG main plot, think back to BG and I think you'll recall LOTS of areas that didn't have anything to do with the iron shortage or Saverok  For instance, did the Firewine Dungeon "really" play a crucial role in terms of story line?  Did helping Drizzt fight off those hordes of baddies really advance the plot?  How about all the random quests?
6825	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a great game, nice big graphics for Gameboy. There are only four or five levels and barely any foot soldiers. You start out each level by picking a turtle to play as, if they die, then you pick another. Its not all that challenging, and it can probably be beaten in a day or a week. The graphics are a bit bland, because it came out so early in Gameboy's history. Its more like black on white, no gray.

I recommend you buy it, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the traditional Game Boy, and the same size as the Game Boy Pocket.
There's also a 2-player mode for this game. Basically, it's a split-screen racing game where you and a second player choose as Sonic or Tails and race each other until the end of the acts.

Wow this game brought back so many memories after beating it on Sega Genesis Collection. I remember this came with my Genesis when I was just the ripe age of 2. Of course that was the first year I started gaming and this game just brings back many memories. The best part about this game is the level design, themes, and music. It's so wonderful and unique. The addition of the bonus stages was great. The only problems were the addition of Tails which was COMPLETELY pointless all he did was get in the way. The biggest problem is that the game is so INCREDIBLY difficult it's almost impossible to play thought this completely without some type of save feature. If you play this on the Gensis then good luck because you'll never make it to the end. This game just gets to extremely frustrating near the end. It's great non the less though so play it now!

To put it simply this game play is easy in the way you will win 49-10 every game. The only way it is hard is if you are the worst team and the computer is the best team with hard playing by the computer in options.
 Diablo2 is Diablo 1, just 3 times bigger. The graphics are average however. Now the reason why the graphics are not much of an improvement, is due to the fact that this game was started 2-3 years ago! Now it's a HUGE game, and the second and third acts are actually gorgeous. The last Act is breath taking in grpahics aswell. The first act is a bit dissapointing, however is it fun? The answer is a simple yes. How much fun? The answer is, more addictive than crack. The RPG elements are alright, the customization is excellent. The prime fun is the action. It's addictive and having fun is the main objective. That's what you have.. fun. This game is not for you, if you are more into the strategic RPGS, like Baldur's Gate. But if you want a game, which gives you a lot of action based fun, this master-piece is for you.  The only lows besides the graphics, are that after 7 hours of addictive playin, you realize that all you are doing is clicking. But, my word it's a lot of fun. ...
HoMM III features more of  everything that made the first two good, adds the necessary new twists to  the basic gameplay (such as a tactics skill with allows you to reorganize  your troops before battle, and an underground map) and brings the level of  graphics up to modern standards.

The  graphics in this game are more modern but somewhat less uniquely stylized  as a result.) As always, the music is both epic and catchy.

I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.

_Sanitarium_ is a really great, old-style, 3rd person adventure game that combines an intriguing story with interesting puzzles, a spooky atmosphere and pretty decent graphics for its time. In its nine levels you visit various parts of the asylum, a huge insect hive, a scary circus and other places, all steeped in the main character's personal mythology.  Each level not only has its own internal continuity, but is connected to the larger story by threads of symbol and dream logic.  I found this fascinating and extremely well done.  It was one of the things that kept me wanting to play even when it was late at night and my eyes couldn't focus any more--something I haven't experienced with a game in a while.
For graphics, the game ruled. For sound, it was awesome. For plot, eeehhhhh, but oh well. over all it was pretty good.
To make a long story short, I played this game for about 10 days, then uninstalled it on my hard drive and sold it in an online auction. The game just does not deliver what it should for what a starship combat simulation should.
Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with "slappers only."

What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal. Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication. Those who say didn't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly. While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996, this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play. And now, you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS. So if you haven't played this, take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game. I highly recommend it.

I liked how there was always something to do, the pacing was just right so time didn't pass too fast or too slow, there was always new things happening around town (festivals, etc) and no day was the same rain, snow, maybe there would be a tornado, maybe someone would greet you at the front door and travel to the mountains with you, etc.
 The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems. The game takes place in a series of six Warp Rooms which as the hub areas of the game. Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level. The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path. Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates, or in bonus levels or secret levels; once you obtain the crystal or gem, you have to reach the end of the level, if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal, you will lose it. I guess they made it that way to be hard. Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room, you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room, however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access. Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him, I cant help but laugh at this. Then theres the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop, the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls, I love that. I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy, but whatever.
THE PERFECT FIRST PERSION SHOOTER. PERIOD.
  Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.

1109	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is, simply put, the best adventure game I have ever played. I'm a newcomeer to the Zelda series, so I'm not too sure how Ocarina rates with the others, but I love it. For an Nintendo 64, the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The lighting rivals that of a Playstation 2 or Xbox or Game Cube. The sound is terrific. Each different sound effect was done in detail. The sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should. The echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and Link's footsteps are done perfectly. The puzzles are challenging, but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you won't put the controller down until you've figured them out. The minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time you've beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful. The controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the game's combat system. The targeting especially helps the later you get into the game. The music is captivating and is very well done. Overall, I think this is one of the best games ever, not just in adventure. It's definetly a game anybody with a Nintendo 64 should have.
The downsides: some missions can  get real tough real fast, and with a multitude of badies who all have itchy  trigger fingers, one level can go from being a half-life like map with few  enemies to a UT type map with a deathmatch like feel to it.  However, you  got the guns, use'em.
As with every Blizzard game, the story is excellent with you controlling all 3 races over 30 missions. The eaxpansion pack also lets you play all 3 races over another

I've also played this game, Sonic Adventure. This game was the best selling game on the Dreamcast. I definetely see why. Great camera angles, great platforming, great speed, great graphics, good voice acting, acceptional cut-scenes, it's perfect. If you want a great 3D Sonic game, get this one. It's also on Gamecube, Xbox Live Marketplace and Playstation Network Store. I don't care what you get it on, just get it. It's certainly a 5 out of 5, 10 out of 10 golden game I'm not as big a Sonic fan as I was in the past, but I certainly love this game no matter what.
You will begin breaking your way through the life-less streets of Raccoon City. you will encounter various different threats, each enemy very different than the last.

This will help you save your precious (and very scarce) ammunition.

I'm not sure what IGN is talking about, but these graphic are terrible. Yes, I know the game is from 1997, but Zelda OCT came out in 1998 and it's graphics have held up to the test of time much better. Although the PS and N64 (pre-graphics expansion) are supposed to be comparable, a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross (1999 PS). The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch. Also, since it was being released on the PS network, Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics (like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube) instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs. Maybe it would look better on an old TV? Who knows. The cut scenes have slightly better graphics, which are almost comparable to Zelda OCT's in game graphics.

3286	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	There are so many reviews of this top game around, that I will keep to the vital points. Is this the best Resident Evil game yet? Yes, It looks absolutely fantastic, but due to familiarity, it's not as scary any more, unless you have no idea what to expect. The zombies don't even fall to pieces in chunks any more! WHY??? Is it in complete 3D? NO! This was hyped up pre-release, but the truth is that, although the camera follows the characters around a little, all scenes are viewed from selected, semi-fixed view points, and you cannot look around at will. Shame! If you make it through to the Bonus game, you can play in first person, and really see the amount of detail present in those scenes. I actually like the fixed perspective of these games, as it looks so cinematic, but imagine the whole game with this freedom... Is it value for money? Yes! This is a long game that rewards some serious time investment. There are many, many locations and places to explore However, although it is a very long game, it's not that difficult! Claire has to battle the Tyrant in the back of a plane halfway through, and this is the only really tough challenge, the rest of the encounters are a bit on the easy side. You should not die much if you are a seasoned player. But the positive details override these small let-downs. Everything looks real! Locations and characters are perfectly realised, and Claire's lighter provides a really beautiful effect. The sounds and music are also excellent, you get to play as three people, and what a story... Dreamcast owners can really boast about this addition to SEGA's line up, and it has to be one of the must-haves of the system.

Now for the cons. This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation, but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck. Sometimes, a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything. This adds much more time to the game, but not in a good way. There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you. Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off, but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve. Also, the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical, and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.

5804	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	I got this game last year and I have only just completed it. In a technical sense, this is indeed better than the other TR games. But I do feel that it is a victim of it's own realisticness. It starts off brilliant and great to play. Especialy the moving train effect. But once you get to the 'City of the Dead' things go downhill. I mean it gets so dark that even with the monitor on full brightness and the house lights out, you still have to lightflares to see whats what. There are also not enough flares to get around with either. Sure this would be the situation in real life, but in real life you have the advantage of 3D vision to guide you. Not in a game.  Not only that, but the levels get boring towards the end aswell. It seems stupid that game programmers would spend out on high-tech graphics and creative innovations and then blanket them with an over abundance of darkness.  Apart from that though. The sound is brilliant. The movies realy fit in well. Lara looks better and (if you can see them) the graphics are great too.

And this game screams to be played by all gamers. With  many advanced gamers using the enclosed Software Developer's Kit (SDK) and  WorldCraft to make new levels, and in some cases, completely new games.

Even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels, they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels.

From it's opening moments, you adapt the body and the attitude of Garrett, a cynical thief whose greed is bigger than his fears.

Overall the game stresses critical thinking, strategic planning, and constant adaptation. It is challenging, and sometimes overwhelming, but always provides fun. Star Wars fan should definitely play this game sometime in their life time. Be aware that this game contains graphics that are completely outdated, yet it is often regarded as inconsequential since they play a completely minimal role in the "fun factor" of Rebellion - unless you're a hardcore graphics gamer.
The graphics are great, the characters actually look like people now! Although they still have some unrealistic features, I liked the anime kind of style that they had for the characters in FF7. Going on, the FMVs are stunning. The best there is around - trust me, the intro alone will make you weak in the knees. The GFs (which I'll get onto later) look great, especially Leviathan and Cactuar : ). Now everything seems to be more detailed, with the monsters, characters and even buildings.

As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series, it has caught heavy anticipation. Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past.

You'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians, Kokiri, Zoras, and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule. Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along.

In essence, Street Fighter Alpha 3 defines fighting games of the Playstation era. It is a smooth balance of speed and strategy.

The games are amazing, the graphics are amazing as well. The VMU is the memory card. Like the original xbox, the memory card plugs into your controller. at the front of the controller there is a hole. when you put the memory card in the first slot on your controller. It will looks like your controller has a screen on it. Sadly, like the gameboy the VMU only has 1 color. The controller feels comfortable in your hand. The Analog stick can be a little wobbly at times. You can also take your VMU anywhere you go! and play some little games on it like you did on the pocket station.

We never thought we'd see the day that any of these would happen, but they did!  The story goes that Star Road (introduced in Super Mario World) is destroyed by Smithy, a new enemy from another dimension.  Now, the world is in peril, and only Mario, Bowser, Princess Peach Toadstool, and two new heroes, Mallow, and Geno, can possibly save Star Road.  Mario goes beyond the Mushroom Kingdom to meet new people and explore new places.  My favorite by far is Nimbus Land, a kindom in the clouds.  The play is great, and the moves are really cool, especially Geno's moves.  The only downside is that the item menu is extremely limited.  There are only about 50 slots, instead of the usually never-ending.  Oh well, them's the brakes.  This game had some of the best graphics on SNES, and it has one of the best stories, second to Chrono Trigger.

On offense, it's not that difficult to have near perfect execution on almost every play, as your primary receivers/and/or backs are boldly highlighted in red on the play selection menu.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why everyone is so down on NFL2K's running game. Granted, on Pro and All-Pro settings it's extremely difficult to gain yardage, but not impossible. I'm no expert, I'm a casual player, and I can rush for more than 100 yards per game, on the difficult settings. And isn't that realistic anyway? In real-life NFL games, a back has had an outstanding game if he rushes for more than 100 yards. You have to mix the pass with the run, just like in real games. And don't even get me started on Rookie mode. I've rushed for more than 800 yards (using 3 different backs) in a single game! The longest single run I've had was 71 yards for a touchdown.  The long and short of it is this: It's a very realistic game, user friendly, graphically beautiful, and inexpensive. There's no better (sports) title for the money!!!

The cinematics are excellent. The first one really got me pumped. I was convinced that I would be playing a game on-par with Final Fantasy 7. Shortly before Disc 1 ended, though, I was having trouble caring. Caring about the characters, caring about the story, caring if I finished the game.
 A Link to the Past is challenging, but not hard. When facing enemies, there are a number of different ways to dispose of them. But most of them, from mind-controlled Hylian Knights to final bosses, have a vulnerability which can be exploited to make your gaming session a little easier.

You have many skills Vocational (Fishing, Lockpicking/Thief, Cooking) and proficiencies in the many different weapons that you'll collect Types (Slashing, Striking and Punching).  Using the different weapons will up your skill in those areas.  He is also able to cast different types of magic (Earth/Water/Fire/Wind) and their secondary skills in each of those areas as well.

The Nintendo 64, or N64 as it is sometimes referred, followed in the wake of success of the first Sony console, the PlayStation, and started producing their games with 3D graphics. Instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward, or left and right, you could now move in all directions. This opened a portal for Nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds. For example, Mario was no longer a 16-bit side scrolling red and blue pixel, but a small Italian man with a healthy knack for adventure. Being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before. The result ended up being games like Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offer.

6687	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This is a fun game that you will find yourself coming back to multiple times. It's not terribly long (in fact, a seasoned player will be able to beat it in less than half an hour) but what's in it is entertaining and gives you that child-like sense of wonder we all long for when playing our favorite.  Definitely recommend this game to anybody who loves Mario or Nintendo!

4092	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I'm not a fan of first-person shooters - I get bored with just killing targets too quickly, and the rapid movements necessary invariably make me  nauseous. Half-Life is different: It makes me think, it has a mystery-laden  storyline and it looks marvellous. The visuals, sounds and effects are  bloody perfect. Not only that, the opponents are very crafty - I was  surprised to see one beast actually duck behind cover when I shot at it!
Cons: digitized graphics don't look as good by today's standard, too short only has 8 wrestlers
*Dynamite Cop- If you're into retro fighting games, you're gonna love this one. Blending humor with traditional side-scrolling action-packed antics, this game is short but sweet.
4430	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	The Playstation is a great console for anyone.  With hundreds upon hundreds of games, this system is becoming very popular.  I used to have a N64, which I grew to dislike because of their expensive games.  The PS can play music cd's and has many accessories, including one which allows more than two people to play.

PS
This game is a total blast to play. Crash is so sexy and cool, and the game has a nice cast of characters. There isn't too much story, but that doesn't matter. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
I played and finished this game back in 1995.  I own other game platforms (PS2, etc) and I have played many other games since then.  None of them is like this one.
346	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	I play Brawl and Melee all the time with my siblings and friends, and sitting squished together 3 feet from the tv was a pain. So I got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this, even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews. but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all. I expected there to be lag with the controls, but there wasn't. They have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in top-notch condition. These are great if you need room or do not like sitting 3 feet from the screen.

  If you want a game with awful graphics, bad gameplay, no storyline sequences, and a Sega Genesis feel, then get this game.
1929	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	This game is precious because it introduced Claire Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Sherry Birkin. Where would we be without Claire, Leon and Ada? They are a big part of what makes the Resident evil Series, without them, it wouldn't be nearly as good! The Best part about this game is the Leon/Ada Kiss in Leon's B scenario :)
6345	Video_Games_5	POS	4.0	This was my first system and I had great fun with it. Some of the games are amazing like Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. This system holds some of the most classic and most well made games. The system itself is alright. I have run into minor problems with it like games freezing or not even loading. The controls are alright, you rarely use the d-pad.
If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time.  It will be much more interesting.
You are given the skeleton of a basic them  park and a goal (i.e. you need x number visitors in your park by such a  date) and off you go. You build rides, designing roller coasters, water  rides, go kart tracks etc. All of this costs money and you need to budget  in order to afford better rides. The simulation is quite realistic from a  demand-and-supply point of view. If you create a roller coaster that is too  intimidating, nobody will ride it...better yet, they will ride it and come  off green-faced and ready to throw up!

Until now. Soul Calibur is a fun game that keeps me coming back for more.  From powerful brutes like nightmare and asteroth to fast fighters like Sophitia and taki to everyone else in between, this game is one of my favorites.

I especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards.  It comes off like you're watching a movie instead of playing a video game, or, to put it another way, you're "playing" a movie.  Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this.  Good job Konami.

9987	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	Acclaim managed to make plenty of lackluster video games using popular Marvel licenses (X-Men, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and let's not forget that Fantastic Four game for the PS1), but to this day Sega is the only company to make a great X-Men game (in fact they made two; this game and it's sequel X-Men 2: The Clone Wars).  X-Men manages to catch the spirit of the comic  allowing you play as Wolverine, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Gambit while getting assistance from Iceman, Storm, Rogue, Archangel, and Jean Grey.  You go through a number of huge levels, ranging from the Savage Land to a Shi'ar ship to Excalibur's castle to a ravaged Sentinel filled future to Asteroid M where you confront Magneto.  You are thrown against hordes of generic looking enemies, but X-Men is surprisingly difficult and features some great boss battles (including Juggernaut, Deathbird, Sabretooth, Ahab, and finally Magneto among others) and the game effectively uses each character's different mutant powers such as Wolvie's berserker attack and Gambit's kinetic laced cards.  The graphics are sharp, colorful, and surprisingly full of detail, while the controls are easy enough to pick up.  All in all, this is one of the best Marvel licensed 16-bit games ever, but it would only be topped by it's sequel X-Men 2: The Clone Wars.
Perfection even with a few minor things.

The characterisation is superior, thanks in no small part to superb pre-rendered cut scenes and excellent voice acting. Konami have taken great pains in all of their Silent Hill games to make sure that we understand the characters in the game, and the original is no exception. Our protagonist Harry is the dullest of the players, but he's still a likeable and well-realised character. Cheryl is not the stereotypical bug-eyed Manga cute girl we've come to expect from Japanese games, and she;s all the more realistic and endearing because of it. Nurse Lisa is sinister and forbidding in her surroundings, but her innocence and frailty is heart-rending - I defy anyone not to mist up when she makes her exit in the game. And Dahlia Gillespie is a masterpiece, she's a scary, eccentric old woman that will stay in the memory long after you've finished playing.

463	Video_Games_5	NEG	2.0	When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.
4470	Video_Games_5	POS	5.0	When you play starcraft, you step into a whole new realm of reality. it isn't anything like warcraft, it is twice as good. the goal of htis game is basically to knock out the computer opponent. There are 3 races to choose from: Terran (Human), protoss (high-teck alien), and zerg (primitave alien). All 3 are unique in their own way, with the terran, you can get tanks that destroy anything the can find, it is  great. There is also the multiplayer option which allows you to play on a LAN, or you can play on battle.net, which is a lot of fun. Buy starcraft, you should buy it even if its $.... The game is worth every penny and you are guarnteed to have fun.
